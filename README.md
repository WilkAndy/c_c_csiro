# LLMs and chatGPT: lessons learned in June 2023

Most scientific authors publish on a small handful of themes.  Suppose we want to find those themes by analysing the abstracts of the author's publications.  This page summarises various ways, along with some pros and cons, of achieving this.  I'm going to use Pep Canadell from CSIRO as my test subject, because he is highly cited.  Using [scrape.py](scrape.py), 403 titles and abstracts written by Pep were retrieved from Google Scholar.

## ChatGPT

Pros/Cons:

- Requires no coding
- Not able to include appreciable new data (a small amount of data may be included in the prompt).  ChatGPT does not include post-2021 data
- Works for popular authors such as Pep, but ChatGPT does not know about less popular authors
- For these authors, Appears to give reasonable results
- Comes at a small financial cost (unless you're still in your free-trial period).

## Vector and query using Llama index

The abstracts are concatenated and loaded into a `VectorStoreIndex`, which is then queried.  See code [vector_and_query.py](vector_and_query.py)

Pros/Cons:

- Able to train on any data supplied
- Simple code
- Appears to give reasonable results.  However, the code [vector_and_query.py](vector_and_query.py) contains two versions of the input data, and one of these gives much poorer results
- About USD0.2 for each query


> My prompt: "In 100-200 words, what are the scientific themes that Pep Canadell from CSIRO has published on?"

> Completion Version 1: "Pep Canadell from CSIRO has published on a variety of scientific themes related to the Earth System Science Initiative. In his 2000 publication, "Non-linear Responses and Surprises: A New Earth System Science Initiative," Canadell discusses the impacts of human land use and land cover changes on the Earth surface-atmosphere system, including the carbon budget, ecosystems, and hydrology. He also proposes a joint effort between PAGES, LUCC, and GAIM to reconstruct global patterns of land use and associated land cover changes since AD 1700. This work would involve a unique intersection of the interests and skills of archaeologists, historians, economists, demographers, ecologists, paleoecologists, palynologists, as well as ecological, climatic, and carbon-cycle modelers.  In his 2022 publication, "Ten New Insights in Climate Science 2022," Canadell summarizes what he assesses as the past year's most important findings within climate change research. These insights include: (1) new aspects of soft and hard limits to adaptation; (2) the emergence of regional vulnerability hotspots from climate impacts and human vulnerability; (3) new threats coming from the climate-health nexus; (4) climate (im)mobility and security; (5) sustainable practices for land use and finance; (6) losses and damages; (7) inclusive societal climate decisions; and (8) ways to overcome structural barriers to accelerate mitigation and limit global warming to below 2Â°C."

> Completion Version 2: "Pep Canadell from CSIRO has published on a variety of scientific themes related to climate change and its impacts on ecosystems. His works have focused on the emergence of regional vulnerability hotspots from climate impacts and human vulnerability, advancing knowledge on the global carbon cycle and its management, the large and persistent carbon sink in the world's forests, ecosystem collapse and climate change, the maximum rooting depth for vegetation types at the global scale, the impacts of decadal climate trends on Australian vegetation, climate change increasing the risk of wildfires, the structure and dynamics of the root system, moving toward net-zero emissions and the need for new alliances for carbon dioxide removal, reconciling top-down and bottom-up approaches for terrestrial CO2 budget, and the vulnerability of permafrost carbon to climate change and its implications for the global carbon cycle."

## Embed, cluster, chain-summarize using LangChain and OpenAI

The code is described in full in [embed_cluster_chain_summarise.py](embed_cluster_chain_summarise.py).  In short, the abstracts are embedded (using `OpenAIEmbeddings`), clustered into a small number of topics (using `networkx.algorithms.community.louvain_communities`), then each topic is summarised (using `langchain.chains.summarize` and an OpenAI `text-davinci-003`) and a final summary is produced.

Pros/Cons:

- Code is flexible, but coding is required (of course, you can just use [embed_cluster_chain_summarise.py](embed_cluster_chain_summarise.py) in this case)
- Customisable to any data
- Appears to give reasonable results
- Costs about USD4 to embed and summarise Pep's 403 abstracts

Output:

> "Overall themes": "Global Carbon Cycle, Carbon-Climate Feedback, Responses to Climate Extremes, Effects of Global Warming on Carbon Cycle, Effects of Rising CO2 Concentrations, Interactions between Carbon Cycle, Human Activity, and Climate System, Effects of Land Use Change on Carbon Cycle, Human Perturbation of Carbon Cycle, Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon to Climate Change, Potential Feedbacks from Terrestrial Ecosystems to Atmosphere, Rate and Form of Release of Carbon, Impact of Climate Extremes on Terrestrial Carbon Cycle, Role of Peatlands in Global Carbon Cycle, Potential Future Impacts of Climate Change on Carbon Cycle, Nitrogen Budget, Methane Emissions, Nitrous Oxide Emissions, Global Methane Budget, Methane Removal, Methane Hydrates, Fluxnet, Nitrous Oxide Budget, Tree Exchange of Nitrous Oxide, Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches to Nitrous Oxide Budget, Biogeochemical Cycles of Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide, Nitrous Oxide Mitigation Potential, Greenhouse Gases, Hydroxyl Radicals, Atmospheric Inversions, El Nino Events, Process-Based Models, Inventories, Data-Driven Approaches, Observational"


## [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT)

[PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) uses LangChain tools to create embeddings locally using HuggingFaceEmbeddings (SentenceTransformers). It then stores the result in a local vector database using Chroma vector store.  To complete prompts, it uses LangChain's GPT4All or LlamaCpp (depends on the model downloaded).

Pros/Cons:

- No upload/download, so can be used for private data
- Easy to use (just provide it some data)
- Poor results, see below
- Free

When trained on json files containing all Pep's titles and abstracts (produced by [scrape.py](scrape.py)), and queried with "In 100-200 words, what are the scientific themes that Pep Canadell from CSIRO has published on?", privateGPT responded with:

> Without more specific information about which topic or time period you refer to in your question and how it relates specifically to Pep Canadell's research output as an author of a particular journal publication series (CSIRO), I cannot provide the answer. However, generally speaking, scientific themes that authors publish on can vary widely depending upon their individual focus areas within specific subfields or fields such as genetics/genomics studies in life sciences and computational biology techniques used to analyze genomic data for example

When trained on a single json file containing paragraphs of Pep's titles and abstracts (produced by [preprocess.py](preprocess.py)), and queried with "In 100-200 words, what are the scientific themes that Pep Canadell from CSIRO has published on?", privateGPT responded with:

> To answer this question accurately and completely, I would need more context as there have been multiple authors named "Pep Canadello" who work for different organizations. Without further information or a specific topic to focus upon, it is difficult to provide an accurate response without the necessary details about their publications related to scientific themes in 100-200 words each


## Running the code

I'm using python 3.10.  Probably later versions work fine.  The required python packages may be installed using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Connecting and Collaborating in CSIRO

The original purpose of this repository was to explore how LLMs could help with connecting and collaborating across CSIRO.  I had hoped a LLM could answer questions such as "What models has CSIRO created in the field of fisheries?" and "What sort of models and/or data could be coupled with these fisheries models to add value to CSIRO research?" and "Who are some people who'd be suited to creating this systems model?".  I hoped to train the LLM on titles and abstracts of CSIRO work.  This turned out to be too ambitious, but I learned stuff along the way and wanted to document it here.

## Scraping data

`scrape.py` scrapes data from Google Scholar using the `scholarly` python package.  This requires repeatedly querying Google Scholar, which runs the risk of being banned by Google Scholar.  Hopefully you can just use the data I've scraped (which is in the `scraped_data` directory) and you won't need to run `scrape.py`.
