It proposes a framework for desertification at the household and farm level, and suggests a research agenda to identify the variables that govern the dynamics of ecosystem services, distinguish between fast and slow variables, define the position and nature of thresholds governing the sustainable state of an ecosystem, and identify cross-scale linkages between the household/farm and levels above it. It also has implications for policy and management, suggesting strategies to address land degradation, restoration efforts, and interventions before a system has crossed key biophysical or socioeconomic thresholds.", "The scientific themes in the text include plant conservation, plant taxonomy, ecology, environmental gradients, herbaceous vegetation, soil water, nutrient content, invasive species, species composition, carbon cycle, and community and landscape patterns.

It examines the effects of population growth and consumption on the environment, the importance of genetic diversity in food crops, the impact of privatization on rural common property resources, and the implications of the Forest Rights Act on resource governance. It also looks at the social dimensions of fertility behavior and consumption patterns in the Anthropocene, and the organizational and economic bases of energy conservation in agriculture. Finally, it explores the trade-offs between conservation and development outcomes, and the economic development and land use from a regional perspective.", "The scientific themes in this text include autecology, synecology, climate, livestock, biodiversity, economics, ecology, resilience, adaptive agents, management, and policy. Autecology is the study of the individual species and their interactions with the environment. Synecology is the study of the interactions between species in a given environment. Climate is the study of the weather and climate patterns in a given area. Livestock are animals that are kept and raised for agricultural purposes. Biodiversity is the variety of life in a given area. Economics is the study of how people use resources to produce goods and services. Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environment. Resilience is the ability of a system to recover from disturbances. Adaptive agents are computer models that simulate the behavior of a system. Management is the process of planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve a goal. Policy is a set of rules or guidelines that are used to make decisions.", "Medical genetics, Data protection and data rights, Energy measurement, Organic impurities, Vector network analyzers, Power supply systems, Sustainability science, Usability principles, Social services, Environmental risk and toxicity, Land capability analysis, International scientific collaboration.", "The scientific themes in this text include the study of social-ecological systems, resilience, sustainability, global change, and the interconnectedness of the globalized world.

It examines the importance of these wetlands to the countries involved, and the effects of human manipulation of these ecosystems. It also looks at the resilience of these systems, and how they depend on the continued flow of water from countries upstream. The text also touches on the importance of water to both animals and humans, and how it has been used and manipulated throughout history.", "The scientific themes in this text include biodiversity conservation, ecosystem resilience, landscape ecology, seascape ecology, species abundance and diversity, global environmental changes, soil biota, tourism and conservation, functional groups of organisms, ecosystem stability, applied ecology, wildlife management, biodiversity use, systems approach to research and management, and the value of ecosystems.
