Specifically, the text discusses the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide on the nitrogen and lignin concentration of leaf litter and the decomposition of plant tissues. It also examines the efficiency with which nitrogen is resorbed during leaf senescence and the impact of elevated carbon dioxide on the decomposition of plant tissues. The text also discusses the results of published and unpublished experiments investigating the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide on litter chemistry and decomposition. Finally, the text summarizes the results of these experiments and provides a meta-analysis of the data.", "Climate change, carbon cycling, water cycles, land surface models, terrestrial biosphere models, vegetation change, atmospheric CO2 growth rate, global monthly aboveground biomass carbon, maximum rooting depth, ecosystem sustainability, land-use strategies, integrated carbon and land-use management, remote sensing, eddy covariance, evolutionary convergence, global change research, hydrological regimes, photosynthesis, inverse hydraulic lift, plant migration, water use efficiency, global warming, tree species distributions, Earth system modelling, biomass equations, ecosystem collapse, co-production of knowledge, wildfires, biological diversity, forest carbon stocks, carbon storage, biodiversity conservation, resource management, data collection, climate-related ecosystem collapse, decadal climate trends, forest conversion, burned area, satellite-derived FAPAR products, fire impacts, food systems, water security, ecological diversity, global land-cover and land-use change, soil nutrients, net primary productivity, UV-B, tropospheric ozone, CO2 fertilization, shifts in disturbances and biome distribution, terrestrial carbon sink, wheat production, pest control, carbon storage in croplands, arid regions, conservation agriculture, soil carbon, yield losses, and site-specific characteristics.", "The scientific themes in this text include the global carbon budget, carbon dioxide emissions, climate change, carbon sequestration, carbon dioxide fertilization effect, land-use change, remote sensing, sustainable development, the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, the Global Carbon Project, the American Geophysical Union, the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, the UNFCCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the 6th International Carbon Dioxide Conference, the CDP, the global carbon cycle, climate variability, Earth observations, biogeochemical cycles, negative emissions technologies, renewable energy sources, terrestrial carbon sources and sinks, climate change, technological solutions, cities in global climate solutions, peak warming and cumulative CO2 emissions, tropical forests in mitigating climate change, atmospheric, land and ocean reservoirs, climate change on CO2 fluxes, climate sensitivity, non-CO2 radiative forcing, mitigation, improved monitoring and assessment of terrestrial carbon stocks, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, policy and behavioural changes, individual components of the Earth system in the global carbon cycle, displacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy, decrease in energy use, the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Carbon Project, the SSP scenarios, the University of East Anglia, Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, the MAGICC7.0 model, global carbon quotas, carbon budgets, carbon-climate feedback, pathways to climate stabilization, global carbon monitoring system, real-time verification of CO2 emissions, negative emission technologies, energy efficiency, and the use of fossil carbon.", "The scientific themes in this text include global biogeochemical cycles of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), the sources and sinks of these gases, the effects of human activities on the atmosphere and climate, the uncertainties in global emissions, the need for research into atmospheric methane removal, the use of inversions to estimate anthropogenic methane emissions, the use of models to quantify global nitrous oxide emissions, the use of observations to improve estimates of the global methane budget, climate change, global temperature, oceanic Nino Index (ONI), terrestrial biosphere models, atmospheric chemistry-transport model (MIROC4-ACTM), isotopic fractionation ratio (\u03b413CE), kinetic isotope effect (KIE), bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) approaches, global Carbon Project (GCP), International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), Nitrous Oxide Model-Intercomparison Project (NMIP), oceanic emissions of N2O, and the need for interdisciplinary networks to better understand the puzzle of renewed growth in atmospheric methane concentrations.", "This text discusses a variety of scientific themes related to the global carbon cycle, including land-use CO2 fluxes, carbon budgeting, climate-human systems, land-use change, and mitigation strategies. It examines the discrepancies between national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) and global bookkeeping models (BMs) in estimating land-use CO2 fluxes, and suggests new tools and models to bridge the gap. It also discusses the availability of data and models to reconcile top-down and bottom-up estimates of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Additionally, it examines the potential of improved cropland practices to mitigate carbon emissions in rice, wheat and maize croplands in China.
