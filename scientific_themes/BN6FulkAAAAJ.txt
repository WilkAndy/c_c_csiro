candidates. The text describes the use of the ATLAS detector to search for evidence of contact interactions in dilepton events from proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, as well as the search for evidence of extra spatial dimensions in the diphoton channel. The text also describes the search for weakly interacting dark matter candidates in the diphoton and E_T^miss final state. The results of the searches are used to set exclusion limits on models with large extra spatial dimensions and on pair production of weakly interacting dark matter candidates.", "This text discusses the scientific themes of particle physics, particle reconstruction, and particle momentum. It describes the measurement of the muon charge asymmetry from bosons produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The results are compared to predictions based on next-to-leading order calculations with various parton distribution functions. This measurement provides information on the and quark momentum fractions in the proton. Additionally, the text discusses the muon reconstruction efficiency and momentum resolution of the ATLAS experiment in proton\u2013proton collisions at 7 TeV in 2010. The performance is described in terms of reconstruction and isolation efficiencies and momentum resolutions for different classes of reconstructed muons. The results are obtained from an analysis of J/\u03c8 meson and Z boson decays to dimuons, reconstructed from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 40 pb-1.", "Neutrino oscillations, particle physics, particle interactions, nuclear physics, particle production, K*(892) vector mesons, nu_mu charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) interactions, the search for the exotic \u0398+ baryon, Bose\u2013Einstein correlations in charged current muon\u2013neutrino interactions, the production of strange particles in neutrino neutral current interactions, the production of opposite sign dimuons from charged current muon-neutrino deep inelastic scattering events, the search for heavy neutrinos, the inclusive production of {rho}{sup 0}(770), f{sub 0}(980) and f{sub 2}(1270) meson resonances in neutrino-nucleus charged current interactions, the precision measurement of charm dimuon production in neutrino-iron interactions, the production of D\u2605+ in \u03bd\u03bc charged current interactions, and the measurement of coherent neutral pion production in neutrino neutral current interactions.", "The scientific themes in the text include the calibration of luminosity for the ATLAS detector at the LHC, the triggers for displaced decays of long-lived neutral particles in the ATLAS detector, the layer correlation technique for pion energy calibration, electron reconstruction and identification efficiency measurements, electron performance measurements, triggering on long-lived neutral particles in the ATLAS detector, and the response and shower topology of 2 to 180 GeV pions measured with the ATLAS barrel calorimeter.

The text also discusses the accuracy and stability of the calibration, the effect of pile-up interactions on the trigger efficiencies, the dependence of the trigger rate on instantaneous luminosity, the inter-alignment of the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter, the determination of the electron energy scale and resolution, the performance in terms of response uniformity and linearity, the electron identification, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies, the charge misidentification probability, and the comparison of the data to Monte Carlo simulations.", "The scientific themes in this text include particle physics, cosmology, and high-energy physics. It discusses the measurement of various cross sections, such as the W^+W^- production cross section, the W+ b-jets production cross-section, the Z Z production cross section, the top quark pair production cross section, the W\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 production cross sections, the charge asymmetry in top quark pair production, the isolated-photon plus jet production cross section, the inclusive electron and muon production cross section, the transverse momentum (pTZ) distribution of Z/\u03b3\u204e bosons, the \u03c4 polarization in W\u2192\u03c4\u03bd decays, the W\u2192 \u2113\u03bd and Z/\u03b3*\u2192 \u2113\u2113 (\u2113= e, \u03bc) production cross sections, and the cross section of single top-quark production in the t-channel. Additionally, the text discusses the measurement of the top quark mass, the polarisation of W bosons, and limits on anomalous WWZ and WW\u03b3 couplings. It also presents a comparison of the results to theoretical predictions from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and Monte Carlo generators, providing a test of the theory in a new kinematic regime and sensitivity to parton distribution functions. The measurements are also used to probe anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings and search for vector resonances decaying to Z \u03b3 and W \u03b3.", "The scientific themes in the text include the study of particle production in proton-proton collisions, the determination of the strange quark density of the proton, and the measurement of kT splitting scales in W\u2192 \u2113\u03bd events. These themes involve the use of the ATLAS detector at the LHC to measure the production of KS0 and \u039b hadrons, the light quark sea composition and magnitude, and the four hardest splitting scales in a kT cluster sequence of the hadronic activity accompanying the W boson.

These searches are conducted using the ATLAS detector at the LHC, and involve collecting data from proton-proton collisions at various centre-of-mass energies. The data is then analyzed to look for any evidence of new physics, and upper limits are placed on the cross-section for anomalous production of particles. The results are used to constrain models predicting same-sign dilepton signals, such as Majorana neutrinos, cascade topologies, and fourth generation d-type quarks.", "The scientific themes in the text are particle physics and particle detection. The first text describes a time-dependent angular analysis of the decay of particles, and the extraction of parameters such as the CP-violating weak phase and the decay width difference. This analysis was conducted using data collected by the ATLAS detector from LHC pp collisions. The second text describes a search for anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking with the ATLAS detector, based on a disappearing-track signature.
