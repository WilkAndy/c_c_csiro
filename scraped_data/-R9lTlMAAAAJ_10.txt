The amount of organic matter present in these systems is controlled by the relative rates of accumulation and loss. Accumulation is controlled principally by net primary productivity whilst losses are mainly a function of the biological stability of the biomolecules present. Processes of lateral transfer can also be significant to both rates of accumulation and loss in localized zones. In this paper, the processes and properties responsible for defining the biological stability of organic matter in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are examined. A conceptual model illustrating the implications that mechanisms of biological stabilisation can have on the molecular composition of natural organic matter in these ecosystems is presented \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 436, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1425874751835464242", "cites_id": ["1425874751835464242"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420304001938", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MuJZPYi5yRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 10, "2007": 21, "2008": 20, "2009": 24, "2010": 22, "2011": 31, "2012": 23, "2013": 29, "2014": 32, "2015": 27, "2016": 25, "2017": 39, "2018": 24, "2019": 23, "2020": 23, "2021": 23, "2022": 25, "2023": 10}}
