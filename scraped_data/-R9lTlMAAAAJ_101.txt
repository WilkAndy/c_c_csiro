Much data on soil structure cannot be used to provide information on rates of change because of an inability to relate measurements at a given time to cropping history. A conceptual model is presented which facilitates quantification of cropping history in relation to soil structure. The model relates structural form, structural stability, stabilizing materials, biological factors and forces which may be exerted on the soil. Soil and crop management practices influence the nature and magnitude of forces involved, biological factors, and the level of stabilizing materials. The model is applied, for illustrative purposes, to five different cropping treatments involving the production of corn and bromegrass grown for different lengths of time over a 15\u2013yr period.
