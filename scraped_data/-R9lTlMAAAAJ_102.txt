However, peat presents a difficult medium in which to measure hydrologic properties, due to its soft structure and high water content. The von Post scale is a widely used measure of the extent of decomposition of peat, which can be applied in the field or the laboratory without specialised equipment. von Post decomposition has been shown to correlate with hydraulic conductivity. However, it is a categorical and subjective measure of decomposition. Technological advances now enable peat chemistry to be described quantitatively and objectively. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is now routinely used to describe peat chemistry, and the capability of this technique has been extended by the development of the molecular mixing model (MMM). The MMM predicts the molecular composition of organic material from the spectral information \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4554399891146024992", "cites_id": ["4554399891146024992"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412010281", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ICjWHJJ6ND8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
