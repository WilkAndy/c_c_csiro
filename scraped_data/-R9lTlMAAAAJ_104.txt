We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (Corg) stock (\u00b1SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 \u00b1 4.90 Mg Corg ha\u22121) and mangroves (65.6 \u00b1 4.17 Mg Corg ha\u22121), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 \u00b1 1.82 Mg Corg ha\u22121). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with Corg stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:dyGod8kC9dQC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7441538678703115807", "cites_id": ["7441538678703115807"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-017-0150-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H85tVgCoRWcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 16, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
