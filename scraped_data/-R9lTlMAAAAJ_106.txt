The soil pHBC is commonly determined by acid\u2010base titration (1:5 soil : solution); however, no standardized equilibration time, type of acid and alkali or concentration of electrolyte has been recommended. This study aimed to establish a standard procedure that is relatively method\u2010independent and reflects the actual soil pH buffering ability. Nineteen soils with a wide range of pH, clay and organic carbon contents were used. Measuring pHBC in a 0.01 m CaCl2 suspension minimized the effects of both ionic strength and cation valence after addition of different types and rates of alkalis and acids. The time required to reach near equilibrium (1 hour to 28 days) was greatly expedited by sonication pretreatment. For soils with a large carbon content, biological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:PicmXY_cuE0C", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=466541749494270208", "cites_id": ["466541749494270208"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejss.12195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AMl-0z99eQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 16, "2023": 7}}
