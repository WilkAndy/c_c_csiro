According to stoichiometric theory, in the absence of nutrient limitation substrate decomposition will reach maximum rates, with C assimilated into microbial biomass at the expense of CO2 production. In this study, we added a 14C labelled low molecular weight substrate (glucose) to a sandy soil along with eleven increasing levels of N, phosphorus (P), and sulphur (S) in relative proportions as required for microbial biomass production. Adding a simple soluble substrate allowed us to explicitly examine changes in microbial transformations of added C, rather than changes resulting from extracellular enzyme activity or the extent of substrate decomposition. We hypothesized that as nutrient addition increased, an increasing proportion of the glucose-C provided \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2094471258558206136", "cites_id": ["2094471258558206136"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071714002971", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uJCgPoMOER0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
