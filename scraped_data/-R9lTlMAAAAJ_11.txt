To evaluate the effects of 35 yr of maize monoculture and legume-based cropping on soil C levels and residue retention, we measured organic C and 13C natural abundance in soils under: fertilized and unfertilized maize (Zea mays L.), both in monoculture and legume-based [maize-oat (Avena sativa L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa] rotations; fertilized and unfertilized systems of continuous grass (Poa pratensis L.); and under forest. Solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to chemically characterize the organic matter in plant residues and soils. Soils (70-cm depth) under maize cropping had about 30-40% less C, and those under continuous grass had about 16% less C, than those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 392, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2815802319366950343", "cites_id": ["2815802319366950343"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.4141/S00-041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x42Wa0q9EycJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 7, "2005": 12, "2006": 9, "2007": 16, "2008": 5, "2009": 13, "2010": 12, "2011": 17, "2012": 21, "2013": 15, "2014": 26, "2015": 34, "2016": 17, "2017": 31, "2018": 28, "2019": 28, "2020": 32, "2021": 25, "2022": 23, "2023": 10}}
