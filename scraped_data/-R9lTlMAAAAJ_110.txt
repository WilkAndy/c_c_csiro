The pulses in soil respiration, extractable C, P and N pools were quantified after a single DRW cycle (ten sampling times over 49 h). Soil was pre-incubated with or without glucose (2.5 g kg\u22121) for 10 days to induce differences in the size and activity of the microflora and then either subjected to a single DRW cycle (7-day drying period) or kept constantly moist. A resin extractable P (Presin) method was used and compared to extraction of dissolved organic (DOP) and inorganic P (DIP) with a salt solution. The pulse in soil respiration, extractable organic C (EOC), Presin, DOP and DIP was immediate and greatest in the first 2 h. The Presin pulse was two to three times that measured by solution extraction (DIP). Also, Presin quantified temporal changes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9232563319469383826", "cites_id": ["9232563319469383826"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-010-0500-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kiBGP2ynIIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
