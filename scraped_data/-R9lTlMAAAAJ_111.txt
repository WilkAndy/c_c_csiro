We investigated SOC and BC composition in black spruce forests on different landscape positions in Alaska, USA. Mean BC stocks in surface mineral soils (0.34 \u00b1 0.09 kg C m\u22122) were higher than in organic soils (0.17 \u00b1 0.07 kg C m\u22122), as determined at four sites by three different 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy-based techniques. Aromatic carbon, protein, BC, and the alkyl:O-alkyl carbon ratio were higher in mineral soil than in organic soil horizons. There was no trend between mineral soil BC stocks and fire frequencies estimated from lake sediment records at four sites, and soil BC was relatively modern (<54\u2013400 years, based on mean \u039414C ranging from 95.1 to \u221254.7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15552103273734363427", "cites_id": ["15552103273734363427"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-009-9403-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I1kgZYcr1NcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 9, "2013": 11, "2014": 11, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
