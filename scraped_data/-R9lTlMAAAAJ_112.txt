This study investigated the effect of organic compounds on carbon and nitrogen dynamics and their relationship with pH changes in two soils differing in initial soil pH (Podosol of pH 4.5 and Tenosol of pH 6.2). Seven organic compounds representing common compounds in decomposing plant residues or root exudates were added to the soils and incubated for 60 d. The largest cumulative soil respiration occurred when glucose, malic acid and citric acid were added. In addition, the Tenosol had the greater respiration compared to the Podosol. The addition of organic acids (acetic, malic, citric, ferulic and benzoic acid) instantly decreased soil pH due to the dissociation of H+ from the acids. The pH of both soils was then restored over time, which was positively correlated with decomposition % of these compounds. The pH of the Tenosol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7672447857953614550", "cites_id": ["7672447857953614550"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071712001320", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1ioIK60CemoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 11, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
