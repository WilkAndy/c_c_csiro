However, clay dispersibility is known to change with water content and time. The purpose of the present study was to determine how incubation of sodic soil under different water content regimes influences clay dispersibility. Two topsoils (depth 0-0\u00b71 m), one sodic [exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) 9 \u00b7 7] and the other non-sodic (ESP 3\u00b78), were collected from an experimental pasture at Kyabram, Victoria, and 2 soils, a sodic topsoil (depth 0-0\u00b71 m, ESP 6\u00b79) and the corresponding subsoil (depth 0\u00b72-0 m, ESP 25\u00b77), were collected from a cropped field at Two Wells, South Australia. The soils were incubated for 264 days in a split-plot design. The main treatments were soil type and incubation water content: continuously air-dry, continuously wet (-50 kPa), or with wet/dry cycles. The subtreatment was water content \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1893017475305346600", "cites_id": ["1893017475305346600"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/s98024", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KJYuOV1ZRRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
