However, our understanding of the occurrence and variability of carbon storage between wetland types and across regions represents a major impediment to the ability of nations to include wetlands in greenhouse gas inventories and carbon offset initiatives. We performed a large\u2010scale survey of nontidal wetland soil carbon stocks and accretion rates from the state of Victoria in south\u2010eastern Australia\u2014a region spanning 237,000 km2 and containing >35,000 temperate, alpine, and semi\u2010arid wetlands. From an analysis of >1,600 samples across 103 wetlands, we found that alpine wetlands had the highest carbon stocks (290 \u00b1 180 Mg Corg ha\u22121), while permanent open freshwater wetlands and saline wetlands had the lowest carbon stocks (110 \u00b1 120 and 60 \u00b1 50 Mg Corg ha\u22121, respectively).
