In systems that adopt minimum or no\u2010tillage practices residue incorporation into the soil may occur slowly and the contribution of soluble and insoluble residue fractions to pH change may vary temporally and spatially. In this study we examined the contribution of whole, water soluble (70\u00b0C for 1 hour for two cycles) and insoluble fractions of canola, chickpea and wheat residues (added at 10 g kg\u22121 soil) to pH change in a Podosol (Podzol; initial pH 4.5) and a Tenosol (Cambisol; initial pH 6.2) over a 59\u2010day incubation period. Whole residues increased pH in both soils, with the magnitude of the pH increase (chickpea > canola > wheat) being related to alkalinity content (concentration of excess cations) of the residue. Temporal release of alkalinity was only observed for the larger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17118182585827640841", "cites_id": ["17118182585827640841"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2011.01387.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CcaIpF0AkO0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
