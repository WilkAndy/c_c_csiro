The method produces a suite of benzene carboxylic acids (BCAs) whose sources have been unclear, but some of which have been used as tracers of soil OC in the ocean. In particular, some evidence suggested they might derive from charcoal, making them a potentially powerful tracer of combustion-derived OC within the environment. In order to constrain their sources and distributions in the environment, we analyzed the concentrations of an extended suite of 18 BCAs from over 75 samples. The entire suite of compounds was produced from most pure organic samples, as well as from charcoal, indicating that a variety of processes lead to their production. Both terrestrial and marine geochemical samples yielded the suite, and OC content, not charcoal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5745816065449803951", "cites_id": ["5745816065449803951"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638007000964", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r0De1UQ9vU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
