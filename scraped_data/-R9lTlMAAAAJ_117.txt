The work presented in this paper is based on a one-off survey targeting key land uses and management practices of eastern NSW. Because of the nature of the work, the land uses and management combinations surveyed in different soils and climatic conditions were significantly unbalanced, and separately analyzing associations after breaking the dataset into different land uses may lead to significant increases in Type errors. Therefore, redundancy analysis (RDA) was undertaken to explore the association between explanatory variables (i.e., land uses, soil management, soil properties and environmental variables) and the variation in stocks (mass per unit area) of particulate organic carbon (POC), humic organic carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ahKOoLCzQxcC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11805601073468968613", "cites_id": ["11805601073468968613"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880914003508", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pY4WqKDr1aMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
