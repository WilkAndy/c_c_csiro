It also discusses how the outputs can be used to provide initial pool estimates for process modelling of soil carbon in a spatial context. The study was carried out in Cox's Creek catchment in northern New South Wales, Australia. Samples were collected in 2010 using a design-based sampling scheme. The measurable fractions of the RothC soil carbon model considered in this study were resistant organic carbon, humus organic carbon and particulate organic carbon. It has been reported that these measurable fractions of soil organic carbon can successfully substitute for the conceptual pools of carbon in the RothC soil carbon model. All the samples were scanned to create MIR spectra and recently developed spectroscopic models by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11350196820318247319", "cites_id": ["11350196820318247319"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706113004333", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l1nWRd__g50J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 13, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
