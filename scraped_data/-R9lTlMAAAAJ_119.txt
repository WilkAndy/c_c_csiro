Often regarded as complementary techniques, solid state 13C NMR and Py\u2013GC/MS are widely used for the characterisation of organic matter. Recently, a molecular mixing model (MMM) was proposed to predict the distribution of C in biochemical components (carbohydrate, protein, lignin, lipid, char) from the 13C NMR spectral distribution, thereby allowing a quantitative comparison with Py\u2013GC/MS product abundances. We discuss the application of this model to a peat core, by comparing NMR-MMM results with Py\u2013GC/MS data. The core represents \u223c5000yr accumulation and ranges from fibric (at the surface) to hemic (bottom).
