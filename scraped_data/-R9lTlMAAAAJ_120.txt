As expected, the impact is minimal for uncharred woods, but is very significant for the charred woods. Quantification of the decrease in CPMAS signal intensity caused by both inefficient cross polarization and rapid T1\u03c1H relaxation is achieved using an advanced spin counting methodology, for which the term \u201cspin accounting\u201d is proposed. 13C CPMAS NMR observabilities determined using the spin accounting methodology were close to 100% for the uncharred samples, and 69\u201382% for the charred samples. This represents a large improvement on the 30\u201340% observabilities determined using other spin counting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16524592516719106848", "cites_id": ["16524592516719106848"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926204002900652", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:INseyVclU-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
