The degree of protection varies with the nature of the minerals present. In a previous study, we reported that when the amount of OC exceeds the sorption capacity of minerals, the rate of OC mineralization is determined primarily by mineral surface area. Here, we report on OC mineralization under conditions of less OC loading and with OC pre\u2010sorbed to the mineral surfaces. The same suite of minerals (kaolinite, illite and smectite with and without goethite coating and illite coated with haematite, goethite and ferrihydrite) was used as in the previous study. The stability of sorbed OC decreased in the order kaolinite > illite > smectite amongst the uncoated clays. Goethite coating of kaolinite and smectite increased the stability of sorbed OM against microbial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:0tRseZjC4qsC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1612179177029508963", "cites_id": ["1612179177029508963"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejss.12180", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yx8geWucXxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
