Our aim was to identify the controls on SOC stability down the whole soil profile, in particular relating to climate, site and human influences. To do this we used three data-mining algorithms (randomForests, gradient boosting machines and multiplicative adaptive regression splines) to identify and assess the controls on the relative proportions of the three fractions down the soil profile. Depth was the key influence on all three fractions, with the proportion of POC decreasing, and the proportion of HOC carbon increasing with increasing depth. SOC was strongly linked with POC, suggesting that the soils in the region are input driven. HOC and ROC were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:fJljFJTiP-AC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3211013228437051924", "cites_id": ["3211013228437051924"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880916301311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FBoSwoTPjywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
