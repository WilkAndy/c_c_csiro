This study investigated the potential for converting beach-cast seagrass wrack into biochar as a \u2018climate-friendly\u2019 disposal option for resource managers. Wrack samples from 11 seagrass species around Australia were initially screened for their biochar potential using pyrolysis techniques, and then two species \u2013 Posidonia australis and Zostera muelleri \u2013 underwent detailed analyses. Both species had high levels of refractory materials and high conversion efficiency (48\u201357%) of plant carbon into biochar carbon, which is comparable to high-quality terrestrial biochar products. P. australis wrack gave higher biochar yields than Z. muelleri consistent with its higher initial carbon content. According to 13C NMR, wrack predominantly comprised carbohydrates, protein \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:H1wcazwC3NUC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3815138329220590783", "cites_id": ["3815138329220590783"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716319386", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v6wr0hgY8jQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 18, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
