However, it also has relatively high fertilizer and water inputs and therefore, N2O emissions. This study examined how varying the volume of individual irrigation events could mitigate N2O emissions from irrigated grain sorghum in Australia. To maintain productivity, the applied water amount was kept constant over an entire growing season. Treatments included irrigation water applications of 120 mm (3 applications), 90 mm (4 applications), 60 mm (6 applications) and 30 mm (12 applications). A custom-designed automated chamber-weighing lysimeter system was used to measure soil N2O fluxes, leaching losses and evapotranspiration simultaneously. The cumulative seasonal N2O emissions (kg N2O-N ha\u22121 season\u22121) were greatest in the 120 mm (1.71 \u00b1 0.70) and 90 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:4DUywrCQPfoC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6553883841728354226", "cites_id": ["6553883841728354226"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192315001148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:shdkTaES9FoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
