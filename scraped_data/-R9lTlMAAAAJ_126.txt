The formation of organo-mineral associations through microbial turnover of labile (i.e. easily decomposed) C is a potential pathway of soil C stabilization. However, association of added C with mineral surfaces may be impacted by soil clay content and/or by nutrient availability (due to higher microbial C use efficiency). We added 14C labeled glucose as a model labile substrate together with either ion exchange resin beads (to induce nutrient limitation), water (no additional nutrients), or four increasing concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur in constant stoichiometric ratios to nine agricultural soils under the same climate and management but along a texture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:6LI0FKmQuhEC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2091181952122667600", "cites_id": ["2091181952122667600"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071716302103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UML66OdeBR0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
