However, changes in SOM pools require derivation of the decomposition rate for the new pools and also impact on simulation of nutrient cycling in soil. Here, we used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to explore the impact of adopting measurable SOM pools on simulated SOC and nitrogen dynamics under three agro-ecosystems at Brigalow, Tarlee and Wagga Wagga in Australia. The decomposition rates for the measurable pools were derived based on the data in the top 30 cm soil at Brigalow. With those decomposition rates, the model could predict the variation in observed total SOC, and also captured the dynamics of the measured SOC fractions at the three sites.
