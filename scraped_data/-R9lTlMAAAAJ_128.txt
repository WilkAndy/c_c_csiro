Together, mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses have been termed \u2018blue carbon\u2019ecosystems (Nellemann et al. 2009) due to their exceptional capacity to sequester and store organic carbon (Corg) over millennial time-scales (McKee et al. 2007, Lo Iacono et al. 2008). Consequently, there has been growing interest in understanding the processes governing Corg accumulation and storage in blue carbon habitats (McLeod et al. 2011, Lavery et al. 2013, Ouyang and Lee 2014) and their potential to mitigate climate change associated with anthropogenic inputs of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the earth\u2019s atmosphere, among other global change threats such as sea level rise (Duarte et al. 2013b, Siikam\u00e4ki et al. 2013, Ullman et al. 2013, Murdiyarso et al. 2015).Over recent years, the recognition of the value of blue carbon ecosystems in sequestering Corg has intensified interest in their conservation as a measure to offset greenhouse gas emissions expressed as CO2-equivalents (CO2-e). In 2009, the United Nations identified opportunities to use the high Corg sink capacity of blue carbon ecosystems (Nellemann et al. 2009). This initiative led to additional research (Bouillon et al. 2008, McLeod et al. 2011, Duarte et al. 2013b) to better understand the mechanisms, magnitudes, and uncertainties associated with the accumulation of Corg in blue carbon ecosystems. Additionally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) initiated the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:A36e8EsbUSoC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2247649783282101518", "cites_id": ["2247649783282101518"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff-Kelleway/publication/320464538_Technical_review_of_opportunities_for_including_blue_carbon_in_the_Australian_Government's_Emissions_Reduction_Fund_Final_Report_Prepared_for_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Energy/links/59e6be7aa6fdcc0e8824958b/Technical-review-of-opportunities-for-including-blue-carbon-in-the-Australian-Governments-Emissions-Reduction-Fund-Final-Report-Prepared-for-the-Department-of-the-Environment-and-Energy.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Dm0DwJFBMR8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
