Plots had been planted with white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) seedlings. Light (PAR), soil moisture and temperature were monitored and recorded throughout the growing season. Forest floor and soil mineral (0\u201320 cm layer) samples were collected from all experimental plots, except those which had plastic mulching. Foliar samples were collected in autumn and analysed for N, P and K and storage compounds. Seedling mortality was 20% higher in unscarified plots. Combined silvicultural treatments increased productivity as much as 14 times, but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8624061016491910038", "cites_id": ["8624061016491910038"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00029364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lmNLYc3RrncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 5, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
