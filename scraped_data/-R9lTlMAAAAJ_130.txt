The survival of salt marshes and their capacity to store C under rising sea levels, however, is partially reliant upon sedimentation rates and influenced by a combination of physical and biological factors. In this study, we use several complementary methods to assess short-term (days) deposition and medium-term (months) accretion dynamics within a single marsh that contains three salt marsh vegetation types common throughout southeastern (SE) Australia.We found that surface accretion varies among vegetation assemblages, with medium-term (19 months) bulk accretion rates in the upper marsh rush (Juncus) assemblage (1.74\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fmm\u202fyr\u22121) consistently in excess of estimated local sea-level rise (1.15\u202fmm\u202fyr\u22121). Accretion rates were lower and less consistent in both the succulent (Sarcocornia, 0.78\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.18\u202fmm\u202fyr\u22121) and grass (Sporobolus, 0.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.22\u202fmm\u202fyr\u22121) assemblages located lower in the tidal frame. Short-term (6 days) experiments showed deposition within Juncus plots to be dominated by autochthonous organic inputs with C deposition rates ranging from 1.14\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.41\u202fmg\u202fC\u202fcm\u22122\u202fd\u22121 (neap tidal period) to 2.37\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.44\u202fmg\u202fC\u202fcm\u22122\u202fd\u22121 (spring tidal period), while minerogenic inputs and lower C deposition dominated Sarcocornia (0.10\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02 to 0.62\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08\u202fmg\u202fC\u202fcm\u22122\u202fd\u22121) and Sporobolus (0.17\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04 to 0.40\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07\u202fmg\u202fC\u202fcm\u22122\u202fd\u22121) assemblages.Elemental (C\u202f:\u202fN), isotopic (\u03b413C), mid-infrared (MIR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:M9uBOdsrCRgC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=325739009158319205", "cites_id": ["325739009158319205"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/14/3763/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZYxeKudBhQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 18, "2023": 4}}
