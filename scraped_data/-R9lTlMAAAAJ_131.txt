Stock solutions of either malic acid and disodium malate or citric acid and trisodium citrate were added to pre-incubated soils at anion-to-acid ratios of 0:100, 10:90, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, 90:10, 100:0 and at 0.25 g C kg\u22121 soil. Soils were adjusted to 80 % field capacity and mixed thoroughly, and three replicates of 50 g of each soil were transferred into individual plastic cores and incubated at 25 \u00b0C in the dark for 30 days. Soil pH, respiration, NH4 +, and NO3 \u2212 were determined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2692522549401055303", "cites_id": ["2692522549401055303"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-013-0682-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R3DHOv7CXSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
