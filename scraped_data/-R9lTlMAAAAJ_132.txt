This study examined the liming effect of different crop residues (canola, chickpea and wheat) down the soil profile (0\u201330 cm) in two sandy soils differing in initial pH as well as the long-term stability of SOC at the amended layer (0\u201310 cm) using mid-infrared (MIR) and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A field column experiment was conducted for 48 months. Chickpea- and canola-residue amendments increased soil pH at 0\u201310 cm in the Podzol by up to 0.47 and 0.36 units, and in the Cambisol by 0.31 and 0.18 units, respectively, at 48 months when compared with the non-residue-amended control. The decomposition of crop residues was greatly retarded in the Podzol with lower initial soil pH during the first 9 months.
