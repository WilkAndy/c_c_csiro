The initialization and/or parameterization of soil C models can vary among studies even when the same model and data set are used, causing potential uncertainties in projections. Although a few studies have assessed such uncertainties, it is yet unclear what these uncertainties are correlated with and how they change across varying environmental and management conditions. Here, applying a process-based biogeochemical model to 90 individual field experiments (ranging from 5 to 82 years of experimental duration) across the Australian cereal-growing regions, we demonstrated that well-designed optimization procedures enabled the model to accurately simulate changes in measured C stocks, but did not guarantee convergent forward projections (100 years). Major causes of the projection uncertainty were due to insufficient understanding of how microbial processes and soil C pool change to modulate C turnover. For a given site, the uncertainty significantly increased with the magnitude of future C input and years of the projection. Across sites, the uncertainty correlated positively with temperature but negatively with rainfall. On average, a 331\u202f% uncertainty in projected C sequestration ability can be inferred in Australian agricultural soils. This uncertainty would increase further if projections were made for future warming and drying conditions. Future improvement in soil C modelling should focus on how the microbial community and its C use efficiency change in response to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:L2DjCdFNi3gC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1229247786956865505", "cites_id": ["1229247786956865505"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/12/4373/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4b9_clkqDxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 12, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
