In this study we investigated the role of soil texture and its interaction with plants in regulating the N2O fluxes in agricultural systems. A measurement system that combined weighing lysimeters with automated chambers was used to directly compare continuously measured surface N2O fluxes, leaching losses of water and nitrogen and evapotranspiration in three contrasting soils types of the Riverine Plain, NSW, Australia. The soils comprised a deep sand, a loam and a clay loam with and without the presence of wheat plants. All soils were under the same fertilizer management and irrigation was applied according to plant water requirements. In fallow soils, texture significantly affected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:2oMuTuaXnloC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2958853733590842441", "cites_id": ["2958853733590842441"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192316302106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:STwFRcv1DykJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
