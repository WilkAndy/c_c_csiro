The aim of this study was to determine the long-term impact of lime application on the quantity and quality of SOC in acid soils. Soils were collected at depths of 0\u201310, 10\u201320, 20\u201330, 30\u201340, and 40\u201350 cm from four long-term lime trials with various lime rates (0\u201325 t ha\u22121), lime histories (5\u201335 years), and soil textures (clay content 5\u201336 %). Surface application of lime was effective in ameliorating both topsoil and subsoil acidities at sites with low clay content. Liming decreased dissolved organic C (DOC) at 0\u201330 cm but increased its aromaticity. Total SOC at 0\u201310 cm decreased or remained unchanged following long-term liming, depending on the rates of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:hWqix75wD0QC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1313910246019760143", "cites_id": ["1313910246019760143"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-015-1076-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DwDBSGjyOxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 3, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
