However, SOC models have not been developed to simulate SOC turnover in saline soils. Due to the large extent of salt-affected areas in the world, it is important to correctly predict SOC dynamics in salt-affected soils. To close this knowledge gap, we modified the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) to simulate SOC turnover in salt-affected soils, using data from non-salt-affected and salt-affected soils in two agricultural regions in India (120 soils) and in Australia (160 soils). Recently we developed a decomposition rate modifier based on an incubation study of a subset of these soils. In the present study, we introduce a new method to estimate the past losses of SOC due to salinity and show how salinity affects future SOC stocks on a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14377172253355747046", "cites_id": ["14377172253355747046"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es2027345", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5ibfq_35hccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
