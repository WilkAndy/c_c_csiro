Achieving this is expected to require removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to offset some hard-to-eliminate emissions. There is, therefore, a clear need for GHG accounting protocols that quantify the mitigation impact of CO2 removal practices, such as biochar sequestration, that have the potential to be deployed at scale. Here, we have developed a GHG accounting methodology for biochar application to mineral soils using simple parameterizations and readily accessible activity data that can be applied at a range of scales including farm, supply chain, national, or global. The method is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of current empirical data, making it a robust method that can be used for many applications including national inventories and voluntary and compliance carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:DejRBzv9GVYC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10612481311419240107", "cites_id": ["10612481311419240107"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.1c02425", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q46dgIYbR5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 27, "2023": 13}}
