Biochar addition to soil has also been reported to alter soil microbial community structure, and to both stimulate and retard the decomposition of native soil organic matter (SOM). We conducted a short-term incubation experiment using two 13C-labelled biochars produced from wheat or eucalypt shoots, which were incorporated in an aridic arenosol to examine the fate of the labile fraction of biochar-C through the microbial community. This was achieved using compound specific isotopic analysis (CSIA) of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). A proportion of the biologically-available fraction of both biochars was rapidly (within three days) utilised by gram positive bacteria. There was a sharp peak in CO2 evolution shortly after biochar addition, resulting from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 364, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11891628200020683727", "cites_id": ["11891628200020683727"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969713003951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zytA59eMB6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 17, "2015": 31, "2016": 45, "2017": 29, "2018": 41, "2019": 35, "2020": 56, "2021": 50, "2022": 41, "2023": 17}}
