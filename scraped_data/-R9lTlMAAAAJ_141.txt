Consequently it was hypothesised that the differences in sorption behaviour between the two landuses may be due to variation in the chemistry of the organic carbon. In this study the relationship between sorption behaviour of the nine chemicals and soil organic carbon chemistry, as determined by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, was investigated. No significant differences were found between the two landuses in the distribution of the four main spectral regions of the 13C NMR spectra of soil OC, except for the carbonyl fraction (165\u2013220ppm), which may reflect the low OC content of the soils from both landuses. For all chemicals, except prometryne, the most significant (P<0.01 or P<0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3733450863895619612", "cites_id": ["3733450863895619612"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653505001402", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HKjfsMfhzzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1}}
