The NWHEAT model satisfactorily predicted above-ground dry matter, leaf area index and grain yields for both crops in rotations with either grassy (Grass) or medic (Medic) pastures, including the lack of significant response of yield to nitrogen fertiliser applied to wheat at sowing. Simulation data for soil water, from SOILWAT2, was consistent with measured data. Simulation with SOILN2, however, largely underestimated soil nitrogen, due to excessive uptake by the simulated wheat during the season when nitrogen was abundant and water supply readily available. Thus, the soil nitrate had to be reset at sowing for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5198277206529333845", "cites_id": ["5198277206529333845"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea03121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vdow45P9I0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
