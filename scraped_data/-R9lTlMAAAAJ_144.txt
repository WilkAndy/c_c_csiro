Here, we developed a simple theoretical model (DP model) considering dynamic physical protection to simulate the dynamics of protected (Cp) and unprotected SOC (Cu), and compared the modelling results with a conventional two\u2010pool (fast vs. slow) model considering chemical recalcitrance. The two models were first constrained using extensive SOC data collected from soils with and without fresh carbon (C) inputs under incubation conditions, and then applied to project SOC dynamics and explore mechanisms underpinning the priming effect (PE). Overall, both models explained more than 99% of the variances in observed SOC dynamics. The DP model predicted that Cp accounted for the majority of total SOC. As decomposition proceeds, the proportion of Cp reached >90% and kept \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:t_XbbNNkFXoC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1457665428380077851", "cites_id": ["1457665428380077851"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13793", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G0_26_uqOhQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
