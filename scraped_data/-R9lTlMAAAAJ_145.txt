We have applied digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques to combine soil-site datasets from legacy and recent sources, environmental covariates and expert pedological knowledge to predict and map SOC stocks in the top 0.3\u2009m, and their uncertainty, across South Australia\u2019s agricultural zone. In achieving this, we aimed to maximise the use of locally sourced datasets not previously considered in national soil C assessments. Practical considerations for operationalising DSM are also discussed in the context of working with problematic legacy datasets, handling large numbers of potentially correlated covariates, and meeting end-user needs for readily interpretable results and accurate maps.
