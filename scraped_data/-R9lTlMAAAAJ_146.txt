The 2007 IPCC report recommended coupling models of terrestrial biogeochemical and atmospheric and oceanic processes in order to improve general circulation models and to recognize the quantitative value of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the global carbon cycle. Estimates of CO2 emissions from soil rely on predictions of the response of different SOC pools to global warming and correct estimation of the size of these pools. In comparison to the pool representing the most stable and biologically unreactive fraction, commonly referred to as passive or inert organic carbon (IOC), the decomposition of labile C is expected to be faster as a response to temperature increase. IOC is a fraction of the SOC pool that is not readily available for microbial decomposition and has turnover times exceeding 100 years (eg Krull et al., 2003).Black C (BC) is usually considered the most abundant form of IOC and is defined as the \u2018carbonaceous residue of incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels\u2019(Schmidt and Noack, 2000). BC is important to several biogeochemical processes; for example, BC potentially modifies climate by acting as a potential carbon sink for greenhouse gases (Kuhlbusch, 1998) and leads to increasing solar reflectance of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, but"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:vK1Ni-xiviEC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16109114317018042167", "cites_id": ["16109114317018042167"], "pub_url": "http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/21235/1/228.pdf#page=29", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nw8FIB8Sj98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
