However, approximately half have been \u2018reclaimed\u2019 \u2013 i.e. converted to other land uses \u2013 potentially turning them into sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we applied C stock measurements and paleoanalytical techniques to sediments from reclaimed and intact tidal marshes in southeast Australia. We aimed to assess the impacts of reclamation on: 1) the magnitude of existing sediment C stocks; 2) ongoing C sequestration and storage; and 3) C quality. Differences in sediment horizon depths (indicated by Itrax-XRF scanning) and ages (indicated by lead-210 and radiocarbon dating) suggest a physical loss of sediments following reclamation, as well as slowing of sediment accumulation rates. Sediments at one meter depth were between ~2000 and ~5300\u202fyears older in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:qStMeLs7OP8C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=979746307328466390", "cites_id": ["979746307328466390"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719313439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1l1QWhPCmA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
