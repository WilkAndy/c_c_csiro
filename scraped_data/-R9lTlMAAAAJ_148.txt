Whilst its effect on C and nitrogen (N) cycling in soils has been investigated previously, this has usually either focussed on the bulk soil organic matter, or a single compound such as glucose. Five low molecular weight dissolved organic C (LMWDOC) substrates (three sugars, one amino acid, one organic acid) were selected for a 14C-CLPP experiment from which turnover rate (t1/2) and immediate carbon use efficiency (CUE) of the substrate were estimated. We demonstrated that whilst soil type had the greatest effect on soil microbial function, the addition of biochar also influenced microbial turnover and CUE of the substrates, most notably in the lowest fertility soil. We also identified that the relationship between turnover and CUE of the five substrates differed substantially \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:6daZS1cS2l8C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12215799413239320278", "cites_id": ["12215799413239320278"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071714003265", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1g6OIdg8h6kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
