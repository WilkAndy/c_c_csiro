The empirical formula on the right of the above equation for marine plankton biomass adequately represents the C/N/P of mixed marine plankton collected in towed nets, but includes an impossibly elevated hydrogen content and a questionably high level of organic oxygen. An elevated estimate of oxygen content is particularly critical because it would lead to an underestimate of the amount of O2 required for complete respiration of plankton biomass. Although direct biochemical measurements have been used previously to constrain the compositions, and hence the reaction stoichiometries, of marine plankton and their remains, such analyses can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 357, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=548506154294019097", "cites_id": ["548506154294019097"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420302000099", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GYTP83CvnAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 10, "2004": 17, "2005": 33, "2006": 22, "2007": 18, "2008": 14, "2009": 16, "2010": 13, "2011": 19, "2012": 11, "2013": 13, "2014": 18, "2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 16, "2018": 20, "2019": 18, "2020": 30, "2021": 16, "2022": 19, "2023": 4}}
