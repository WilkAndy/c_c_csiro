However, in order to improve assessment of the potential for increasing SOC storage in the agricultural lands of Victoria, Australia, further information is required on current SOC levels and how they are related to environmental conditions, soil properties and agricultural management. Therefore, we measured stocks of SOC at 615 sites in pasture and cropping systems in Victoria, encompassing eight regions, five soil orders and four management classes (continuous cropping, crop\u2013pasture rotation, sheep or beef pasture, and dairy pasture), and explored relationships between the C stocks and environment, soil and management. The results showed an extremely wide range in SOC, from 2 to 239 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:B-V0BYNYc0AC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12517488092461748553", "cites_id": ["12517488092461748553"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR15008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SVFdfxkNt60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
