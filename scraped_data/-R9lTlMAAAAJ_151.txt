Using the pre-validated Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, we simulated the long-term (1022 years) SOC dynamics in the top 0.3\u2009m of soil at 613 reference sites under 59 representative cropping systems across Australia\u2019s cereal-growing regions. The point simulation results were upscaled to the entire cereal-growing region using a Monte Carlo approach to quantify the spatial pattern of SOC stock and its uncertainty caused by cropping system and environment. The predicted potential SOC stocks at equilibrium state ranged from 10 to 140\u2009t\u2009ha\u20131, with the majority in a range 30\u201370\u2009t\u2009ha\u20131, averaged across all the representative cropping systems. Cropping system accounted for ~10% of the total variance in predicted SOC stocks.
