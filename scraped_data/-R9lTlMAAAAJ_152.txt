In this study, residues of young wheat shoots and roots, mature wheat shoots and roots or a 1:1 mix of mature shoot + root (MSR) were added to sand inoculated with a diverse microbial community. Respiration was measured over 60 days. On days 0, 15, 30 and 60, total C and nitrogen were measured, residue C chemistry was determined by 13C\u2010NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and microbial community structure was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. Cumulative respiration was least in young roots and did not differ among the other residue types. In MSR, decomposition was similar to that of shoots and roots alone; shoot material appeared to be preferentially decomposed.
