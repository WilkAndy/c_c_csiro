A central challenge to cropping for cellulosic ethanol is the potential environmental damage from increased fertilizer use. Previous analyses have assumed that cropping for carbohydrate in residue will require the same amount of fertilizer as cropping for grain. Using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that increases in biomass in response to fertilization are not uniform across biochemical classes (carbohydrate, protein, lipid, lignin) or tissues (leaf and stem, grain, reproductive support). Although corn grain responds vigorously and nonlinearly, corn residue shows only modest increases in carbohydrate yields in response to high levels of fertilization (25% increase with 202 kg N ha\u22121). Lignin yields in the residue increased almost twice as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6924642482064303164", "cites_id": ["6924642482064303164"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es103252s", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PKQFLKZFGWAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
