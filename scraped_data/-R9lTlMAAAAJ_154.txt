The carbon chemistry of incubated peats was characterized using 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In situ decomposition decreased as a function of increasing alkyl carbon content of the initial organic matter, providing direct evidence of the oft\u2010cited link between substrate quality and decomposition rates. More mass loss occurred in the bog peat samples than in the dried peat samples. However, at the peat surface, the amount of CO2 emitted was not significantly different between bog peat and dried peat. Carbon inputs, and therefore the sink or source status, of these peats are yet to be quantified."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13114814328317444251", "cites_id": ["13114814328317444251"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2009.01220.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m4CQdiUuAbYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 6}}
