Furthermore, where long records do exist, interpretations of climate and ecological change can be hampered by marked changes in sedimentary environment which, in turn, affect the taphonomy of palaeoecological remains. As a consequence, in order to determine how wetland systems responded to climatic and environmental changes, we first need to understand how their depositional environment changed through time. Here we document the development of freshwater Welsby Lagoon, south-east Queensland, from a 12.7\u202fm sediment sequence with a basal age of ca. 130,000 years. We present a variety of proxies reflecting change within the wetland. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations and carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios are used to infer the source of organic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ax16qXk-rEQC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1705624165973271543", "cites_id": ["1705624165973271543"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118302154", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:96MoZSSYqxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
