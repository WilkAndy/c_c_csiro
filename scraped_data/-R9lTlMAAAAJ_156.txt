The concept of co-limitation could be used to integrate key factors affected by crop rotation. This paper tested the hypothesis that the effect of crop rotation on the yield of wheat is partially mediated by changes in the degree of co-limitation between nitrogen and water. Four rotations were established on a sodic, supracalcic, red chromosol in a Mediterranean-type environment of southern Australia. Rotations included wheat grown after (a) faba bean harvested for grain, (b) faba bean incorporated as green manure, (c) ryegrass pasture, or (d) medic pasture; barley was grown after wheat in all cases. The response of wheat to the rotations during 3 growing seasons was analysed in terms of nitrogen and water co-limitation, and the response of barley was taken as a measure of the persistence of rotation effects.
