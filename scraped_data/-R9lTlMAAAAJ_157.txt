This paper tested the hypothesis that the rate of soil nitrogen mineralisation increases with increasing exponent \u03c4, as affected by both spatial and temporal sources of variation. Rates of nitrogen mineralisation in an uncropped sandy loam soil were calculated using a simulation model with detailed nitrogen and water balances, and long-term weather data for 6 Australian locations in a range of annual rainfall from 260 to 360 mm. Daily rates of mineralisation were calculated using actual rainfall, and variable or fixed temperature and evaporative demand. The annual pattern of mineralisation rate, calculated as a function of rainfall and variable temperature and evaporative demand, was bimodal with peaks in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17121536028547735889", "cites_id": ["17121536028547735889"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR02113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UeGj3k3qm-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
