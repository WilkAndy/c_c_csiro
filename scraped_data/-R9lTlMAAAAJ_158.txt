This study compared how three herbaceous under-vine cover crop assemblages affected OC and N pools in four edaphically distinct vineyard agroecosystems. Using physical fractionation and soil spectral analysis we: 1) compared effects of grass and legume mono- and poly-cultures on total, coarse (\u226550 \u00b5m) and fine (<50 \u00b5m) pools of OC and total N (TN), as well as extractable N (ExN), and 2) assessed predictions of OC and TN pools by infrared spectroscopy (IRS) and partial least squares regression analyses (PLSR). Compared with the control treatment, total, coarse and fine fraction OC were greater in the presence of grasses and legumes; ExN was increased 38% by legumes, and 78% in legume-grass mixture. With initial calibration, we used one soil spectral analysis to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:PV2Y7XyTJDgC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1356964270187199724", "cites_id": ["1356964270187199724"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706120306121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7LxncdDn1BIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 11}}
