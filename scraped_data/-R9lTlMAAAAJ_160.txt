The Royal Soc. of Chemistry, Cambridge", "pages": "45-60", "abstract": "In its broadest sense the term soil organic matter encompasses all organic materials contained in soil and can be viewed as a complex heterogeneous mixture of living, dead and decomposing plant, animal and microbial tissues and detritus. The complexity of soil organic matter when considered in conjunction with the fact that a significant portion of it is bound to the soil mineral fraction has made its chemical characterization difficult. In the classical method of soil organic matter analysis a prerequisite to the selective chemical characterisation of soil organic matter has been its extraction and separation from the soil mineral fraction. The most common extractants have been alkaline solutions, such as sodium hydroxide and/or sodium pyrophosphate. The extracted organic materials which generally account for< 50% of the total soil organic carbon are often fractionated into humic and fulvic acids on the basis of pH. The portion of the organic carbon not extracted by alkaline solutions has been termed humin. The use of alkaline reagents to extract soil organic carbon is inefficient and may create artefacts. In addition extraction schemes are entirely non-selective with respect to the various biological entities in soils.Methods are required which can either extract the entire organic fraction from the soil in an unaltered state or methods which allow us to characterize the various organic fractions obtained without reactive chemicals. Based on the wide range of chemical structures contained in soil organic fractions it appears doubtful that an extractant which meets the above requirements will ever be produced.
