This study employed a combination of elemental and stable isotope analyses to explore whether pastures sown to either kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) or a combination of panic (Panicum maximum) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) could increase soil organic carbon (SOC) levels in five regions across southern Australia. Carbon was sequestered under kikuyu at a rate of 0.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u20131\u2009year\u20131 along the south coast of Western Australia. Lower but still significant sequestration rates were found for kikuyu in South Australia (0.26\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u20131\u2009year\u20131). No changes in SOC were found for panic\u2013Rhodes grass pasture systems in the northern district of Western Australia. Additionally, we found no changes in SOC when kikuyu-based pastures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2347985023195663398", "cites_id": ["2347985023195663398"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr13111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JsyDPfC3lSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
