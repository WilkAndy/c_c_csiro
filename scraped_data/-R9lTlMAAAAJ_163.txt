Here, we develop a calibration transfer methodology to appropriately apply an existing mid infrared (MIR) spectral library with analyte data on the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) into particulate (POC), mineral-associated (MAOC), and pyrogenic (PyC) forms to nearly 8000 soil samples collected in the Great Plains ecoregion of the United States. We then use this SOC fraction database in combination with a machine learning-based predictive soil mapping approach to explore the controls on the distribution of fractions through soil profiles and across the region. The relative abundance of each fraction had unique depth distribution profiles with POC fraction dropping exponentially with depth, the MAOC fraction having a broad distribution with a maxima at 35\u201350 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:8wCixH_E2vEC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4497115249985537101", "cites_id": ["4497115249985537101"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-021-00755-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TURhPX72aD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 13, "2023": 9}}
