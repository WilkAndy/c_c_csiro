However, these ecosystems are rapidly declining with little understanding of what drives the magnitude and variability of C associated with them, making strategic and effective management of blue C stocks challenging. In this study, our aims were threefold: (1) identify ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic variables associated with 30\u202fcm deep sediment C stock variability in blue C ecosystems in southeastern Australia, (2) create a predictive model of 30\u202fcm deep sediment blue C stocks in southeastern Australia, and (3) map regional 30\u202fcm deep sediment blue C stock magnitude and variability. We had the unique opportunity to use a high-spatial-density C stock dataset of sediments to 30\u202fcm deep from 96 blue C ecosystems across the state of Victoria, Australia, integrated with spatially explicit environmental data to reach these aims. We used an information theoretic approach to create, average, validate, and select the best averaged general linear mixed effects model for predicting C stocks across the state. Ecological drivers (i.e. ecosystem type or ecological vegetation class) best explained variability in C stocks, relative to geomorphological and anthropogenic drivers. Of the geomorphological variables, distance to coast, distance to freshwater, and slope best explained C stock variability. Anthropogenic variables were of least importance. Our model explained 46\u202f% of the variability in 30\u202fcm deep sediment C stocks, and we estimated over 2.31 million\u202fMg\u202fC stored in the top 30\u202fcm of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:TWu9ukPC6OgC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11898306966981538660,15299127152811784423", "cites_id": ["11898306966981538660", "15299127152811784423"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/2041/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZHN9gyVHH6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
