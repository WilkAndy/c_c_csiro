There are currently limited data on the sorption behaviour of these chemicals in marine or estuarine sediments and the properties controlling their sorption have not been well established. The median average PFOS Kd value (30.4 L/kg) was >8 times that for PFOA (3.3 L/kg) and PFHxS (2.8 L/kg). Highly significant (P < .001) linear relationships were found between values for sorption coefficients (Kd) for all three chemicals (PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS) to the estuarine sediments and organic carbon (OC) content with r2 values ranging from 0.87 to 0.91. The nature of the constituents of OC was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for a subset (10) of the sediments to assess whether the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:8bEfNjzhQ0EC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8500680044796748029", "cites_id": ["8500680044796748029"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720307737", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_aBcU3Z7-HUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
