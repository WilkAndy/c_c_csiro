However, SOC stocks are reduced by soil erosion which is commonly omitted from calculations of crop production, C cycling, C sequestration and C accounting. We used fields from the wind eroded dryland cropping region of Western Australia to demonstrate the global implications for C sequestration and C accounting of omitting soil erosion. For the fields we previously estimated mean net (1950s\u20131990) soil erosion of 1.2 \u00b1 1.0 t ha\u22121 y\u22121. The mean net (1990\u20132013) soil erosion increased by nearly four times to 4.4 \u00b1 2.1 t ha\u22121 y\u22121. Conservation agriculture has evidently not reduced wind erosion in this region. The mean net (1990\u20132013) SOC erosion was up to 0.2 t C ha\u22121 y\u22121 across all sampled fields and similar to measured sequestration rates in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:0PPYGq5nos8C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14134381350935033860", "cites_id": ["14134381350935033860"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875963716300660", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BHhjlvNoJ8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
