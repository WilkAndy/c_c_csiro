However, there is growing interest in studying SOC with an emphasis on quantifying its changes in space and time. This is because of the potential for soil to be used to sequester atmospheric C. There are many issues which make this difficult, for example shortcomings in sampling designs, and differences in vertical and lateral sampling supports between surveys, particularly if legacy data are used as the baseline survey. In this study, we systematically work through these issues and show how a protocol can be developed using design-based and model-based statistical approaches to estimate changes in SOC in space and time at different spatial supports. We demonstrate this protocol in a small subcatchment in the upper Namoi valley for estimating the change in SOC over time, whereby the baseline dataset was collected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13886535645576993084", "cites_id": ["13886535645576993084"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR13081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PJlqe5jitsAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
