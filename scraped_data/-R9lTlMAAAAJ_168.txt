These processes affect ecosystem fertility, but can also generate forms of N which have detrimental environmental impacts, such as N2O. Understanding drivers of biological communities involved in key N-transformations is therefore of much interest. The effects of physicochemical and environmental properties on the relative size (abundance within total DNA pool) of biological communities involved in 3 key N transformations were investigated. Soils from 14 locations spanning a rainfall gradient across 3 agricultural regions (Clare, Mallee, Balaclava) were sampled, with samples taken from the surface and at depth from each site. Based on PCA of physicochemical and environmental properties, the soils fell into 2 distinct groupings: Clare and Mallee\u2009+\u2009Balaclava \u2018types\u2019.
