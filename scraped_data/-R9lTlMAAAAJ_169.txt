Nitrogen-15 cross polarization (CP) spectra of the materials were all very similar, with 64\u201375% of total signal assigned to amide N. Spin counting analysis indicated that 37\u201380% of potential signal was accounted for in the CP spectra, and that NMR observability using the CP technique (N obs -CP) was higher for stems and leaves than for roots, and higher for wheat and eucalyptus than for peas and kikuyu. The 15N direct polarization (DP) spectra contained higher proportions of signal assigned to amine (up to 22%) and nitrate (up to 17%), and less assigned to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15294823153363135316", "cites_id": ["15294823153363135316"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-005-2153-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VCuhXp8gQtQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
