Soils from seven field sites, with varying long-term agricultural management regimes, were characterised physicochemically, on the basis of their bacterial and fungal community structures (using PCR-DGGE), and by assessing potential catabolic functions (MicroResp\u2122). Soil type, rather than agricultural management practice, was the key determinant of microbial community structure and catabolic function (P<0.05). Following multivariate analysis, soil pH was identified as the key habitat-selective physicochemical soil property associated with variation in biological diversity and profiles of organic substrate utilisation. In particular, the capacity of soils to catabolise different C-substrates was closely correlated (\u03c1=0.604, P=0.001) to pH. With decreasing pH, the catabolism of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 335, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6588236781230244548", "cites_id": ["6588236781230244548"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071707004257", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xEJkUXIeblsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 13, "2010": 18, "2011": 26, "2012": 19, "2013": 16, "2014": 19, "2015": 25, "2016": 25, "2017": 29, "2018": 22, "2019": 18, "2020": 33, "2021": 36, "2022": 23, "2023": 10}}
