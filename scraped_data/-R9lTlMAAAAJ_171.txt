This interest arises because of the important contributions that organic matter, and thus organic carbon and its associated elements, make to both productivity and the potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this report was to develop an objective spatial assessment of the potential of Australian agricultural soils to capture and retain additional organic carbon using existing environmental, soil and land-use data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=690094718377075502", "cites_id": ["690094718377075502"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=690094718377075502&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LiM9dn21kwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
