While accurate and efficient methods for predicting soil organic C content and composition have recently been developed for soils under agricultural land uses, such methods under forested land uses are currently lacking. This study aimed to develop a method using infrared spectroscopy for accurately predicting total organic C (TOC) and its fractions (particulate, POC; humus, HOC; and resistant, ROC organic C) in soils under environmental plantings. Soils were collected from 117 paired agricultural-reforestation sites across Australia. TOC fractions were determined in a subset of 38 reforested soils using physical fractionation by automated wet-sieving and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Mid- and near-infrared spectra (MNIRS, 6000\u2013450 cm\u22121) were acquired from finely-ground soils \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:voxG-9qLvA4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3421048883939061068", "cites_id": ["3421048883939061068"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479717301172", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TC1vntUBei8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
