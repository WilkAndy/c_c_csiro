Crop-soil modeling remains a cost-effective option for understanding the interactions between rainfall, soil, and crop growth, from which management options can be derived. The objective of this study was to assess the error in the prediction of soil water content at key decision points in the season against continuous, multi-layer soil water measurements made with frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) probes in long-term experiments in the Mallee region of South Australia and New South Wales. Field estimates of the crop lower limit or drained upper limit were found to be more reliable than laboratory-based estimates, despite the fact that plant-available water capacity (PAWC) did not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:L1d--jQnBlAC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17475604625938558641,8590096946425904651", "cites_id": ["17475604625938558641", "8590096946425904651"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.asabe.org/abstract.asp?aid=48679", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sa49TNHRhfIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
