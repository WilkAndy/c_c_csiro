In kikuyu-based pastures up to 33 years of age, SOC accumulated exclusively in the coarse size fraction (>50\u2009\u03bcm) in the sandy soils of southern Western Australia. In South Australian loams, regardless of pasture age, new SOC was found to accumulate in both the coarse and fine (<50\u2009\u03bcm) size fractions. These differential results suggest that in soils with low clay content, new SOC remains in an unprotected form that is highly vulnerable to loss through decomposition and erosion. The Rothamsted Carbon Model, modified to track changes in stable isotopes, was able to represent the changes in total \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7756688306028180115", "cites_id": ["7756688306028180115"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR12351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k3I86upKpWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
