Damaged bogs are thought to be the source of dried peats now common throughout the Alps. We described the characteristics of a bog peat and a dried peat, to better understand the relationship between the two. Standard chemical properties of peat were measured: pH, loss on ignition, gravimetric contents of carbon and nitrogen, and electrical conductivity. We also measured the concentrations of total and plant-available elements, and the chemical composition of the organic carbon, leading to a measure of the extent of decomposition. The results suggest that this is a typical Sphagnum bog peat\u2014low pH, high carbon content\u2014and the distribution of carbon groups and other elements reflect the stable water source of this groundwater-fed Sphagnum bog. The properties of the dried peat were most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10290347360519474060", "cites_id": ["10290347360519474060"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR04014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jEskX2eozo4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
