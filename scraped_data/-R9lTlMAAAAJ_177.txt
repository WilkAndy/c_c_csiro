Effective use of this technique requires understanding of the spatial variability in \u03b413C among primary producer(s) as well as quantification of the isotopic fractionations that occur as C moves within and among ecosystem components. In this experiment, we assessed \u03b413C variation in the cosmopolitan mangrove Avicennia marina across four sites of varying physico-chemical conditions across two estuaries. We also compared the isotopic values of five distinct tissue types (leaves, woody stems, cable roots, pneumatophores and fine roots) in individual plants.We found a significant site effect (F3, 36\u202f=\u202f15.78; P\u202f<\u202f0.001) with mean leaf \u03b413C values 2.0\u2030 more depleted at the lowest salinity site compared to the other locations. There was a larger within-plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:7MdmnBSEV98C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7237335576269534678", "cites_id": ["7237335576269534678"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771417310090", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1rXXj1wucGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
