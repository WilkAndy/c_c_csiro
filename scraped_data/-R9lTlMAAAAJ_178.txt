These properties make the use of HF a common pretreatment step for removing paramagnetic interferences and concentrating carbon prior to solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy with the working assumption that any SOM lost during HF treatment will not bias the resulting NMR spectra. Hydrofluoric acid is also used to isolate a mineral-stabilized OM fraction with the working assumption that most mineral-stabilized OM is primarily low molecular weight compounds bound to mineral surfaces and when the minerals are dissolved in HF, the OM bound to these surfaces will be lost to solution. The working assumptions behind these two uses of HF dissolution appear to be contradictory. To address this apparent conundrum, we treated a number of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:-qiMcZ-2Z0YC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8117161725840159290", "cites_id": ["8117161725840159290"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706117303488", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OnIZRZXzpXAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
