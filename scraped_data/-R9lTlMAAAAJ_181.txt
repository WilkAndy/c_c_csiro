As a consequence, interpretation of the infrared (IR) spectra of SOM is difficult and ambiguous and there is a necessity to establish more reliable IR spectral band assignments. We investigated a novel approach to identify IR spectral bands based on correlation with more easily interpreted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. The IR spectra of HF-treated soils were obtained in both near- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) regions and generalized two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy was employed as the computational correlation tool. 2D NMR/NIR and 2D NMR/MIR heterospectral correlation analyses were performed, separately. We found that NIR spectroscopy could identify aliphatic carbon in SOM as a broad peak occupying the entire NIR region. On the other hand, the MIR spectra contained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=887513539582398691", "cites_id": ["887513539582398691"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924203113000258", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:45AorNwUUQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 8, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
