CAB International, Wallingford, UK", "pages": "75-83", "abstract": "Chemical changes associated with the decomposition of small diameter logs (< 20 cm) of red pine (Pinus resinosa), white spruce (Picea glauca), and tamarack (Larix laricina) from Ontario, Canada were quantified using 13 C NMR. The degree of lignin alteration in the logs as decomposition increased was studied using the tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis approach. Changes in the chemical composition of the logs during decomposition varied with species and wood component (bark, sapwood, heartwood). With the exception of red pine bark, the general pattern of decay involved a loss of O-alkyl carbon and an accumulation of aryl carbon contained in altered lignin structures. In the red pine and tamarack logs, decomposition of the heartwood was slower than that of the sapwood, but in white spruce heartwood and sapwood were equally susceptible to decomposition. Changes in the acid: aldehyde ratio appeared to be a sensitive index of the extent of lignin degradation and variations in this ratio were often observed before significant changes in 13 C NMR spectra became apparent."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15260649181587273816", "cites_id": ["15260649181587273816"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19971900296", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WHhdhpO3yNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
