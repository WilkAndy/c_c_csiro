Brisbane", "volume": "4", "number": "5", "pages": "1-6", "abstract": "This paper reports the latest findings from studies on the role of organic matter in soil pH change. Soil pH changes induced by canola, chickpea and wheat residues in two soils with different initial pH (pH 4.4 and 6.2) were investigated under field conditions over 18 months. Changes in pH were related to ash alkalinity however, the relative contribution of canola residue to pH increase was greatly reduced at low initial pH. Furthermore, even at 2 months residue alkalinity had moved down the soil profile, particularly for chickpea. A subsequent incubation study examined the effects of separate soluble and insoluble fractions of these residues. The soluble fraction was the source of alkalinity within the first 2 days. For chickpea the increase in pH by the soluble fraction was greater than whole residue at 2 days however, this fraction subsequently acidified soil possibly due to nitrification of soluble N. These data highlight the need for a better understanding of residue chemistry and the interactions with the soil environment in order to predict the changes in chemical properties such as pH."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:zHqMQc01HCoC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13578289079528822009", "cites_id": ["13578289079528822009"], "pub_url": "https://www.iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/0273.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-ZThGvrFb7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
