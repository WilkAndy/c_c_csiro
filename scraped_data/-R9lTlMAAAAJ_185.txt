Repeat-pulse labelling of perennial grass pastures (kikuyu and Rhodes grass) with 14C in the field in Western Australia was used to trace the allocation of C to SOM fractions and to determine the stability of each fraction over an extended period. For kikuyu, >40% of the 14C fed to the plants was allocated belowground within 10 days of labelling, and after 1 year half of this remained. Allocation of 14C belowground under Rhodes grass ranged between 20 and 24% of 14C applied and remained constant for up to 6 months. At least 90% of the 14C belowground was found in the surface 300\u2009mm of soil. The allocation of 14C to the coarse (50\u2009\u00b5m\u20132\u2009mm) and fine (<50\u2009\u00b5m) SOM fractions was similar in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6814131075630536669", "cites_id": ["6814131075630536669"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR12375", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3ZfoRxyokF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
