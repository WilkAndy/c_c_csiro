In the subsequent incubation period 2, a set of cores from each treatment were subjected to one DRW cycle (air-dry for 7 day; field capacity for 14 day) or maintained at field capacity.Long-term soil water regime altered soil respiration with the largest CO2 pulse occurring in soil with the longest dry period \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3847773448926418683", "cites_id": ["3847773448926418683"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-011-0931-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-1Zwv5AJZjUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
