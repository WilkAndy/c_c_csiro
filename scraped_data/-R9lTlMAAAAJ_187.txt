There is little published information about stubble production, and the implications of harvesting it. We use a survey of field trials reporting Harvest Index (HI), ABS production statistics and APSIM simulations to assess how much biomass might be available in different regions and what factors might affect stubble production. Although HI does vary between years and regions, it does appear that robust spatial estimates of stubble production can be obtained from grain production data and HI. In many farming systems some stubble will be left to maintain soil cover, input to soil carbon or animal feed. The amount of stubble potentially available for harvesting is considerably less than the total stubble production, and the amount likely to be worth harvesting on a regional basis will be even smaller."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10842335811488315612", "cites_id": ["10842335811488315612"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2008/concurrent/emerging-opportunities/5842_dunlopm.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3PhBs_m2d5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
