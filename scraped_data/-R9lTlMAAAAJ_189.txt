In this study, we evaluated the effects of land\u2010use types (native vegetation (NV) vs. no\u2010till system (NT)) on OC stocks and on the chemical composition of organic matter (OM), and sought to understand the mechanisms that govern OC protection in the studied highly weathered soils. To achieve these objectives, we used an OC fractionation scheme in a combination of solid\u2010state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analyses in soils from six farms in southern Brazil. Our results showed smaller OC stocks (whole soil) under NT than under NV in four of the six sites. In addition, the OC stock differences between land\u2010use types were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:e6AMIDGT8rIC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16033149102726158602", "cites_id": ["16033149102726158602"], "pub_url": "https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ejss.12972", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CpndYikwgd4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
