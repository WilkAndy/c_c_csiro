Yet, most BC determination methods published to date measure operationally defined BC fractions, oftentimes with a high potential for artifacts and a lack of specificity for one of the two major forms of the BC continuum, soot/graphitic BC (GBC) and char/charcoal BC (CBC). This paper describes a method that reduces the potential for artifacts to accurately and selectively measure the concentration of GBC in complex mineral and organic matrixes. Marine and lacustrine sediments, river sediments, suspended particles, and a marine plankton sample were first demineralized with a mixture of hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids to expose any biochemical entrapped in a mineral matrix.
