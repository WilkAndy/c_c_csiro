Our previous studies showed that such CO2 priming enhanced alkalinity release but the mechanisms behind this are unknown. This study used 14C-labelled compounds to investigate the effect of added organic compounds on decomposition of soil organic matter and how this related to the enhanced release of alkalinity. 14C-labelled glucose and malic acid were added at a rate of 1 mg C g\u22121 to topsoil and subsoil of the Kandosol (pH 5.4\u20135.8, C 8.9\u201312.4 mg g\u22121), the Podosol (pH 4.4\u20134.5, C 1.5\u20132.9 mg g\u22121) and the Tenosol (pH 4.7\u20136.1, C 1.9\u201310.9 mg g\u22121), and incubated for 15 d. 21\u201327% of the added C was mineralised to CO2 in the Podosol while 56\u201374% was mineralised in other two soils with malic acid being mineralised more than glucose. The CO2 priming, as a result of added C, was substantial, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2718444838642959563", "cites_id": ["2718444838642959563"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071713001910", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y8TOhC3buSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
