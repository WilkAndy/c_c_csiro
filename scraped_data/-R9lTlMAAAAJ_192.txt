We have developed analytical methods to measure the OR of terrestrial carbon stocks from biomass chemistry that give accurate and precise estimates of ecosystem atmosphere-biosphere gas flux OR. Here we apply these techniques to agricultural ecosystems to address two uncertainties: (1) whether changing crop species distribution can change ecosystem OR, and (2) whether nutrient status can change ecosystem OR. Analyzing the top three crops in the U.S. (soybean, corn, wheat), we showed differences between the OR of net primary production (ORab) of legumes (1.109 \u00b1 0.003) versus grass crops (corn: 1.028 \u00b1 0.001; wheat: 1.033 \u00b1 0.001).
