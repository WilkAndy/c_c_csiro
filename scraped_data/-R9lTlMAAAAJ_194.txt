Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy, which is an inexpensive and safe technique, can be used for OC prediction; however, appropriate modeling is required. This study aimed to evaluate different strategies for MIR modeling calibration in order to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of OC prediction in bulk soils and fractions (e.g., particulate OC, POC; humic OC, HOC; resistant OC, ROC). We used regional topsoil samples (i.e. 0\u201320 cm) from Brazil (BRreL) and an existing Australian national library (AUnaL) to calibrate different models, which were used to predict OC content in target samples (i.e. subset of the Brazilian sample set). In total, eight strategies were tested, including the use of different soil libraries, different chemometric approaches (i.e. common \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:8k3R5ScbChQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16568019252904796087", "cites_id": ["16568019252904796087"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706119327545", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tx85ubpt7eUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
