The chemical recalcitrance of seagrass organs is one characteristic driving carbon storage, but the molecular background of this feature is poorly understood. We assessed molecular composition changes of Posidonia australis sheaths (SH) and roots plus rhizomes (RR) along a sediment core, encompassing 3200\u202fcal. yr BP, by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR), conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC\u2013MS) and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM-GC\u2013MS). Significant trends with depth (age) in the composition of both SH and RR remains of P. australis were observed from all methods. In general terms, polysaccharides become depleted (degraded) and lignin enriched (selectively preserved) as age increases, and the minor constituents \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:RLNBYFRFzK0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1177043608285467424", "cites_id": ["1177043608285467424"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638019301287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:INP_7OyyVRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
