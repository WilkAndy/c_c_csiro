General equations representing the level of land-use categories and strata are followed by a short description of processes with more detailed equations for carbon stock changes in specific pools by land-use category. Principles for estimating non-CO2 emissions and common equations are then given. Specific, operational equations to estimate emissions and removals by processes within a pool and by category, which directly correspond to worksheet calculations, are provided in Sections 2.3 and 2.4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:dL6bBWYs_hoC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1284064280609635904", "cites_id": ["1284064280609635904"], "pub_url": "https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/107138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QD6B8qjp0REJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
