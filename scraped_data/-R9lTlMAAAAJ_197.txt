Unfortunately, little guidance on how to achieve robust, cost-effective estimates of blue C stocks to inform inventories exists. We use existing data (492 cores) to develop recommendations on the sampling effort required to achieve robust estimates of blue C. Using a broad-scale, spatially explicit dataset from Victoria, Australia, we applied multiple spatial methods to provide guidelines for reducing variability in estimates of soil C stocks over large areas. With a separate dataset collected across Australia, we evaluated how many samples are needed to capture variability within soil cores and the best methods for extrapolating C to 1 m soil depth. We found that 40 core samples are optimal for capturing C variance across 1000's of kilometres but higher density sampling is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:E6txfPUJewUC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12346934101952364829", "cites_id": ["12346934101952364829"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0416", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HQEHHCYfWasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
