We assessed OC vulnerability using two approaches. For the first approach, we postulated that the OC deficit of continuously cropped soils relative to nearby pastoral soils would provide a measure of the quantity of potentially vulnerable OC in pastures. As a test, soils were sampled to a depth of 15\u2009cm at 149 sites and the total organic carbon (TOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) contents were measured. The second approach involved measurement of OC mineralisation in a laboratory assay (98 day aerobic incubation at 25\u00b0C). For the pastoral soils, the mean TOC and POC was about twice that of the cropped soils. On average, 89% more OC was mineralised from the pastoral soils compared with the cropped counterparts. However, the quantity of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:x-IcQEm-ju4C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1020110370515599976", "cites_id": ["1020110370515599976"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr17148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aEJGKvooKA4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
