This study investigated the potential for N2O mitigation by manipulating the soil moisture deficit through irrigation scheduling in combination with, and in comparison to, using the nitrification inhibitor, 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Lysimeter cores planted with wheat were fitted with automated chambers for continuous measurements of N2O fluxes. Treatments included conventional irrigation (CONV), reduced deficit irrigation (RED), CONV-DMPP and RED-DMPP. The total seasonal volume of irrigation water applied was constant for all treatments but the timing and quantity in individual irrigation applications varied among treatments. 15N-labelled urea was used to track the source of N2O emissions and plant N uptake. The majority of N2O emissions occurred immediately \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:V1pH50uuazEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7733293519909996679", "cites_id": ["7733293519909996679"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr15315", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h8gQznstUmsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
