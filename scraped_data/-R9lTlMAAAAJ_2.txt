Small changes in the soil organic carbon stock could result in significant impacts on the atmospheric carbon concentration. The fluxes of soil organic carbon vary in response to a host of potential environmental and anthropogenic driving factors. Scientists worldwide are contemplating questions such as: \u2018What is the average net change in soil organic carbon due to environmental conditions or management practices?\u2019, \u2018How can soil organic carbon sequestration be enhanced to achieve some mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide?\u2019 and \u2018Will this secure soil quality?\u2019. These questions are far reaching, because maintaining and improving the world's soil resource is imperative to providing sufficient food and fibre to a growing population. Additional challenges are expected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 1457, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9985589116481793221", "cites_id": ["9985589116481793221"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912003635", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xWznQGXwk4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 26, "2014": 74, "2015": 100, "2016": 113, "2017": 135, "2018": 142, "2019": 197, "2020": 183, "2021": 210, "2022": 194, "2023": 68}}
