Focusing on red-brown-earth soils (Chromosol) under dryland agriculture in the Mid-North and Eyre Peninsula of South Australia, our aims were 2-fold: (i) to provide a baseline of soil OC stocks (0.3\u2009m) and OC fractions (mid-infrared predictions of particulate, humus, and resistant OC in 0.1\u2009m samples) in cropping and crop-pasture systems; and (ii) to evaluate whether the inclusion of management-based indices could assist in explaining regional-level variation in OC stocks and fractions. Soil OC stocks in both regions varied ~20\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u20131, with higher OC stocks in the Mid-North (38\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u20131) than the Eyre Peninsula (29.1\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u20131). The humus OC fraction was the dominant fraction, while the particulate OC was the most variable.
