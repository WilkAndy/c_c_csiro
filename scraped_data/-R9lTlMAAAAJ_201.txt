In soils, carbon exists in two forms\u2013organic and inorganic. It is the organic form (referred to as organic soil carbon) that is most likely to be included in carbon trading. Most of the organic soil carbon comes from the decay of organic matter such as plants, animals and microbes.There is potential to increase stores of organic soil carbon but this depends on many factors, including existing levels of carbon, soil type, temperature, rainfall and how the land is managed. Accurately measuring changes in organic soil carbon for the purposes of carbon trading can be difficult and expensive."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6054029683725604944", "cites_id": ["6054029683725604944"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/informit.999242703192119", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UJgi9us7BFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
