Many carbon accounting systems apply simple emissions factors to production units to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. However, in Australia, substantial variation in climate, soils, and management across >20\u2009Mha of field crop sowings and >30\u2009Mha of sown pastures in the intensive land use zone, provides substantial challenges for a national carbon accounting system, and simple emission factors are unlikely to apply across the region. In Australia a model framework has been developed that requires estimates of crop dry matter production and harvested yield as the first step to obtain carbon (residue) inputs. We use Australian Bureau of Statistics data to identify which crops would need to be included in such a carbon accounting system. Wheat, barley, lupin, and canola accounted for >80% of field crop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6921613804031728082", "cites_id": ["6921613804031728082"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/CP08428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0lnAHRWDDmAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
