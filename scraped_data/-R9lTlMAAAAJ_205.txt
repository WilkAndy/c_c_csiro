However, results from field studies on the response of SOC content and composition to N addition are highly variable across different ecosystems. The interpretation of SOC responses to N addition are often complicated by the differences in climate, soil substrate and other factors. To address this question, we measured SOC and its components in adjacent broadleaved and coniferous subtropical forests after 14 years of N addition. SOC in the top 50 cm increased by 2.1 kg m\u22122, 1.8 kg m\u22122 and 1.2 kg m\u22122 for low, medium and high rates of N addition in the broadleaved forest, but did not change significantly in the coniferous forest. Increased SOC in the broadleaved forest was contributed by the significant increases in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:pKq9KLJfUZEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14037519796667630862", "cites_id": ["14037519796667630862"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719361005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DkXjj-FJz8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
