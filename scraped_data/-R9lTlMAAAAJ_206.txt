Carbon cycle\u2010climate feedbacks could alter the OR of the biosphere by affecting the quantity and quality of organic matter in plant biomass and soil carbon pools. This study considers the effect of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]) on the OR of a hardwood forest after nine growing seasons of Free\u2010Air CO2 Enrichment. We measured changes in the carbon oxidation state (Cox) of biomass and soil carbon pools as a proxy for the ecosystem OR. The OR of net primary production, 1.039, was not affected by elevated [CO2]. However, the Cox of the soil carbon pool was 40% higher at elevated [CO2], and the estimated OR values for soil respiration increased from 1.006 at ambient [CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:jMMVlDWEh88C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1694554244015223739", "cites_id": ["1694554244015223739"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015JG003010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u3MoVxtEhBcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
