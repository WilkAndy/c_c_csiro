Diffuse reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is an attractive alternative because it is a high-throughput, cost-effective and easy-to-use technique that provides information on the amount and nature of soil mineral and organic components. However, interpretation of complex MIR spectra can be challenging due to difficulties with distinguishing SOC peaks from overlapping mineral-related peaks. We present a novel approach to predict the entire NMR spectra of SOC from corresponding MIR spectra using partial least-squares regression (PLSR) in an R environment. We developed a multi-response MIR\u2013PLSR prediction model by regressing corresponding NMR and MIR spectra of 99 HF \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:lZkERF9nS_wC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5261416251027116710", "cites_id": ["5261416251027116710"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115000555", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:plLwQTROBEkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
