Here we examine the effects of acid hydrolysis \u2013 the method used to separate the nonhydrolysable C \u2013 on the quantity, structure and isotopic makeup of C in pure model carbohydrates and those contained in senescent maize that resemble C inputs to SOM. We demonstrate that significant alterations occur during hydrolysis resulting in C mass losses (up to 75% preferential loss of 13C) and de novo synthesis of nonhydrolysable, 13C-depleted material dominated by aromatic > alkyl > carbonyl moieties. We infer that similar losses, and transformations of 14C, would partly explain the greater ages attributed to the chemically resistant C, seriously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10682269416984234895", "cites_id": ["10682269416984234895"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071713001417", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j0tdCnALP5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
