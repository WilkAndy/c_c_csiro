In this study, 15 typical and/or native Australian plant materials were finely ground and incubated with a sandy soil at 25\u00b0C and 55% water holding capacity without nitrogen (\u2212N) or with nitrogen (+N) addition (77mg Nkg\u22121 soil as KNO3). The C mineralisation dynamics were monitored for 356 days and the initial biochemical characteristics of the plant materials were determined by NMR and wet-chemical analyses. Under the \u2212N treatment, C mineralisation rates of the plant materials were positively correlated with their initial N contents during the first several weeks, and then negatively correlated with lignin and polyphenols contents during the late stages of incubation. Thus the ratios of lignin/N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 297, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13618740759307474353", "cites_id": ["13618740759307474353"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071704002524", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sdWnvpB8_7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 14, "2008": 10, "2009": 20, "2010": 6, "2011": 17, "2012": 23, "2013": 19, "2014": 16, "2015": 21, "2016": 18, "2017": 26, "2018": 19, "2019": 16, "2020": 17, "2021": 22, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
