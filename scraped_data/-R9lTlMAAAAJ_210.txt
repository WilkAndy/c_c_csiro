Crop plants with increased lignin levels may lead to increased soil C sequestration. Grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) exhibiting lower lignin due to the naturally occurring brown midrib mutation (bmr) may allow an assessment of the potential of biotechnology to affect soil C sequestration by manipulating plant lignin levels. A 194-d laboratory microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the mineralization of bmr and normal plant residue from four sorghum hybrids. Cross-polarization magic angle spinning 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance of the residue agreed with chemical analysis that the bmr residue contained altered lignin and less lignin per mass weight. Ground bmr or normal grain sorghum residue was added to soil, with or without an inorganic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4332942616649734725", "cites_id": ["4332942616649734725"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071707000272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RRqPWVq0ITwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
