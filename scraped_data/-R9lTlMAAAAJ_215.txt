Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Conference of the Grasslands Society of NSW Queanbeyan, Grassland Society of NSW", "pages": "5-9", "abstract": "Organic carbon in soils is a heterogeneous mixture of organic materials decomposing at different rates. The amount of carbon found in a soil can be viewed as a balance between organic matter inputs (plant production and residue handling) and losses due to decomposition. In this paper, the carbon cycle and the ways various components of soil carbon can be affected by soils, climate and management practices are explained. Also discussed are the relationships between the potential, attainable and actual levels of carbon in soils, and the factors that influence them. Because soil organic matter content changes slowly, computer-based models are used to examine potential long-term influences of management practices. The RothC carbon model has been calibrated to allow the dynamics of total organic carbon and the particulate organic carbon, humus organic carbon and recalcitrant organic carbon (charcoal) fractions under Australian conditions to be predicted. Using data collected from a native pasture site at Yass, NSW, the relationship between pasture productivity and soil organic carbon content was explored. This highlighted the challenges of making significant increases in soil carbon in grazing systems, at least over reasonable time scales."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2676823674079943030", "cites_id": ["2676823674079943030"], "pub_url": "http://grasslandnsw.com.au/news/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/Baldock-Skjemstad-Bolger-2007.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dhnk-_L8JSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
