With each cycle of photosynthesis and respiration, a very small fraction of organic carbon survives to enter the Earth\u2019s soil and sedimentary organic carbon reservoirs (Hedges and Keil 1995). This slow leak out of active cycling is responsible for the formation of the Earth\u2019s 1,500-2,300 Gt (Amundson 2001) soil organic carbon pool.Although it is understood that this oxidation-reduction cycle is fundamental to the large-scale existence of soil organic carbon, almost nothing is known about smaller-scale fluctuations in oxidation state of carbon within soils and larger ecosystems. Soil carbon oxidation state is a basic property likely influenced by soil forming factors. At a fundamental level, Cox describes the energy stored within an organic moiety, and in this way connects ecosystem energetics to soil properties. In this grant we made the first measurements of carbon oxidation state (Cox) in soils and in other Earth system carbon pools, and developed language to connect measurements of Cox to ecosystem thermodynamics measurements. Additionally, we identified 1) extent of organic matter decomposition, and 2) chemical structure of original biomass as the two properties most strongly influencing organic matter Cox values."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14444172130019443401", "cites_id": ["14444172130019443401"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/30588133/2002020Chadwick_FINALkms.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yQJoFAYCdMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
