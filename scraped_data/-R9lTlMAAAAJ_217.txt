This study aimed to quantify the impact of vegetation type on soil carbon stocks (organic and inorganic) and nitrogen in the surface soils (0\u201310 cm) of mangroves and tidal marsh habitats within nine temperate coastal blue carbon wetlands in South Australia. Results showed differences in surface soil organic carbon stocks (18.4 Mg OC ha\u20131 for mangroves; 17.6 Mg OC ha\u20131 for tidal marshes), inorganic carbon (31.9 Mg IC ha\u20131 for mangroves; 35.1 Mg IC ha\u20131 for tidal marshes), and total nitrogen (1.8 Mg TN ha\u20131 for both) were not consistently driven by vegetation type. However, mangrove soils at two sites (Clinton and Port Augusta) and tidal marsh soils at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:evIcR_-jKtEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1835503333795427999", "cites_id": ["1835503333795427999"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr20040", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n_broo4EeRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
