However, the interrelation of SOC and these drivers and their potential connection networks are rarely assessed quantitatively. Using observations of SOC dynamics with detailed soil properties from 90 field trials at 28 sites under different agroecosystems across the Australian cropping regions, we investigated the direct and indirect effects of climate, soil properties, carbon (C) inputs and soil C pools (a total of 17 variables) on SOC change rate (rC, Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121). Among these variables, we found that the most influential variables on rC were the average C input amount and annual precipitation, and the total SOC stock at the beginning of the trials. Overall, C inputs (including C input amount and pasture frequency in the crop rotation system) accounted for 27% of the relative influence on rC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:6UW509z96lEC", "num_citations": 285, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6942516775413916689", "cites_id": ["6942516775413916689"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13767", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EaS8ZTnGWGAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 20, "2019": 38, "2020": 45, "2021": 57, "2022": 73, "2023": 46}}
