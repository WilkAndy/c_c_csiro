For example, appropriate use of fertilisers to maximise productivity also maximise returns of organic residues to the soil. But an upper limit of input exists in Australian dryland agriculture because of the limitation that the availability of water places on potential plant productivity. Losses of carbon from soil result from decomposition and conversion of carbon in plant residues and soil organic materials into carbon dioxide. Processes that accelerate decomposition open the losses tap further."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1172418687185420331", "cites_id": ["1172418687185420331"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/informit.484637303448813", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K4C3kZVERRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
