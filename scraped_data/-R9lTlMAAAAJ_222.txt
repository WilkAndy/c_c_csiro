The charcoal content of sediments is important for understanding past fire regimes, as well as the role this recalcitrant carbon plays in the global carbon cycle. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides a rapid, non-destructive and cost effective method for simultaneously analysing numerous organic and inorganic sediment properties. The use of IR spectroscopy is well developed for determining concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), biogenic silica and carbonate in lacustrine sediments. In soil science IR spectroscopy is also routinely used to determine charcoal content, however the potential for analysing charcoal content from lacustrine sediments has yet to be investigated. Here we develop IR spectroscopy and partial least squares regressions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:KEHW5XCvxlQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9941621188171327589", "cites_id": ["9941621188171327589"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018219309137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZehyNMy794kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
