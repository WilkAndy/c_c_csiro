A replicated experimental study was performed using three different fire spread modes: heading fires (i.e. fires which spread with the wind), flanking fires (i.e. fires which spread perpendicular to the wind) and backing fires (i.e. fires which spread against the wind). In addition to 13C NMR measurements of PyC, detailed fire behaviour measurements were recorded during experiments. Experiments showed that heading fires produced significantly more aryl carbon in ash samples than flanking fires. All other experimental comparisons for burnt fuel samples involving different fire spread modes were statistically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:LYW2S8xaXYEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8857178808686770033", "cites_id": ["8857178808686770033"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719342950", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cXfk-zIF63oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
