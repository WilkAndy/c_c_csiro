We propose that the RothC model be embedded within the STOS-SOC, which is driven by satellite-derived inputs and readily available geospatial inputs, such as digital soil maps. In particular, advances in remote sensing have enabled the development of satellite products that represent key inputs into soil carbon models, examples being evapotranspiration and biomass inputs to soil, which characterise space\u2013time variations in management and land use. Starting from an initial calibrated base for prediction, as new observations are acquired, data assimilation techniques could be used to optimise calibration algorithms and predicted model outputs. We present initial results obtained from the implementation of the proposed STOS-SOC approach to the 1445-km2 Cox\u2019s Creek catchment in northern New \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:nk1qRvIppk4C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6847957321366154520", "cites_id": ["6847957321366154520"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR14178", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GK0Q2ebUCF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
