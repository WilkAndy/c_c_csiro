We manipulated the diversity, applied here as species richness, of the microbial community present in similar soils on two contrasting land-covers\u2014an adjacent pasture and forest\u2014and observed the transformations of plant detritus and soil organic matter (SOM) using stable isotope (13C) tracing coupled with a novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment. The amount of detritus-C degraded was not affected by the microbial diversity (p\u2009>\u20090.05), however the fate of detritus- and SOM-C across the diversity gradient was complex and land cover-dependent. For example, in the pasture soil, higher diversity led to lower CO2 production (p\u2009=\u20090.001), a trend driven solely by SOM-C mineralization. There was no relationship between diversity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:sK9NQJKSZRcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9946599221319880675", "cites_id": ["9946599221319880675"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-020-00736-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:48_y3UprCYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6}}
