Currently, estimates of soil organic C for countries or continents are either unavailable or largely uncertain because they are derived from sparse data, with large gaps over many areas of the Earth. Here, we derive spatially explicit estimates, and their uncertainty, of the distribution and stock of organic C in the soil of Australia. We assembled and harmonized data from several sources to produce the most comprehensive set of data on the current stock of organic C in soil of the continent. Using them, we have produced a fine spatial resolution baseline map of organic C at the continental scale. We describe how we made it by combining the bootstrap, a decision tree with piecewise regression on environmental variables and geostatistical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 271, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10348816905894693065", "cites_id": ["10348816905894693065"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12569", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yQhpQSVino8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 19, "2016": 27, "2017": 28, "2018": 31, "2019": 30, "2020": 32, "2021": 32, "2022": 37, "2023": 29}}
