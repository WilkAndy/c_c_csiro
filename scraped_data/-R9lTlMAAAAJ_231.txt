Keel, Hirte, Abiven, W\u00fcst-Galley, and Leifeld (2017) argued that the C input data used in our study \u201cmay have led to important biases and critical omissions\u201d, due to:(i) ignorance of belowground C inputs from roots/rhizodeposition and (ii) use of a constant harvest index (HI) for crops. They contended that \u201cbelowground C inputs can contribute as much as 90% to total carbon inputs in agroecosystems\u201d by citing K\u00e4tterer, Bolinder, Andr\u00e9n, Kirchmann, and Menichetti (2011) and Bolinder, Janzen, Gregorich, Angers, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:jOyC0gq838wC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9922018099882978469", "cites_id": ["9922018099882978469"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13949", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pWyFiuQWsokJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
