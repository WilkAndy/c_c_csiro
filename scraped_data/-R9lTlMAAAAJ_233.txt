Australian agriculture accounts for 87.9 million tonnes CO 2-equivalent (Mt CO 2-e), 16.8% of total national GHG emissions (which includes all gases from all sectors): CH 4 and N 2 O account for 76% and 24% of the agricultural total respectively, with emissions of CH 4 from livestock being the dominant agricultural GHG source (67% of agricultural emissions). Mitigation options fall into three broad categories:(1) emissions reduction, consisting of technologies, practices or a combination of both that directly reduce GHG emissions;(2) enhancing GHG sinks: this option largely relates to increasing the capture and storage of photosynthetically derived C in plant biomass, soil, or harvested products, and (3) fossil fuel substitution: use of crops and residues for electricity generation or liquid fuel production. Short-term options for mitigation of CH 4 emissions from extensive livestock systems are mainly limited to approaches based around livestock and pasture management (including plant species selection), and offsetting emissions through increasing C stocks. Solutions such as alternate hydrogen sinks in the rumen, vaccines and livestock breeding are long-term goals with significant hurdles to overcome. Many of the actions required to reduce N 2 O emissions are identical to best-practice strategies to maximise the efficiency of N use and minimise undesirable environmental impacts. There are two main options:(1) managing the availability of mineral N relative to crop requirements to minimise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:t2c9fUEjrewC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7749381973695366784", "cites_id": ["7749381973695366784"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103078919", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gIbt2thVi2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
