The picture shows a comparison of chickpea plants with Glean (chlorsulfuron) present during rhizobial growth, seed germination and in the soil (right) with chickpea plants grown in the absence of Glean (left), six weeks after planting. The chlorsulfuron concentration in the soil is equivalent to 10 per cent of the recommended agricultural application rate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:N3pez2oqSB0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11877453130716164265", "cites_id": ["11877453130716164265"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11877453130716164265&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qTCwZLEw1aQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2}}
