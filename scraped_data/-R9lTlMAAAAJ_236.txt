Replacing a portion of the lost stocks will sequester atmospheric carbon with the concurrent benefit of enhancing soil sustainability. The ability of the fine fraction of soils (\u226450-\u00b5m fraction) to adsorb organic carbon (OC) is considered a key mechanism capable of stabilising soil OC against loss. The difference between the current and maximum concentrations of OC in the soil fine fraction (FFC) has been termed the \u2018saturation deficit\u2019 (SatDef) and used to define the potential for a soil to sequester carbon. For New Zealand surface 0\u201315 cm soil layers, pedotransfer functions have been derived to quantify the soil carbon SatDef. The ability of combining infrared spectroscopy (IR) with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to derive predictive algorithms for soil properties included in these pedotransfer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:FecvS_q01PcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11144643977988873646", "cites_id": ["11144643977988873646"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR19149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rh05sKa6qZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
