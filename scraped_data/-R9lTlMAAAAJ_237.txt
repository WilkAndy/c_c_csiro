Discuss", "volume": "2017", "pages": "1-26", "abstract": "Coastal saltmarshes are dynamic, intertidal ecosystems which are increasingly being recognised for their contributions to ecosystem services, including carbon (C) accumulation and storage. The survival of saltmarshes and their capacity to store C under rising sea levels, however, is partially reliant upon surface 15 sedimentation rates and influenced by a combination of physical and biological factors. In this study, we use several complementary methods to assess short-term (days) deposition and medium-term (months) accretion dynamics within three saltmarsh vegetation types common throughout southeast (SE) Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:wmBOIy6d62IC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9003945448587573438", "cites_id": ["9003945448587573438"], "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/089a/430e8d305241dd60ddc8005ba620ec66db4b.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vrgOOK5w9HwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
