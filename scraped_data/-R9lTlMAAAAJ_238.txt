The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether temperature and litter type interact to alter the chemical composition of OM decomposed during incubation. Either a higher-quality (fresh) eucalyptus leaf litter or a lower-quality (aged) eucalyptus leaf litter was mixed into a eucalyptus woodland soil. These soil and litter mixtures were incubated for 14 days at 12 \u00b0C or 32 \u00b0C. The OM composition of the starting and ending mixtures were characterized with solid-state 13C cross polarisation magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Despite significantly greater losses of CO2 at 32 \u00b0C relative to 12 \u00b0C in both litter mixtures, the OM composition of the fresh litter mixture was similar between the two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:QC_fukgq8lwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8362380407146230578", "cites_id": ["8362380407146230578"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706115300069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MjOjrKwkDXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
