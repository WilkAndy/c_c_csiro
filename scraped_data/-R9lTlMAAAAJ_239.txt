Carbon (C) compounds commonly found in plant material (citric acid, ferulic acid, glucose and glucosamine hydrochloride, potassium and sodium citrate) were selected based on the type and number of functional groups and applied to two soils differing in initial pH. Organic acid (R-COOH) addition instantly decreased soil pH via H+ dissociation followed by an increase in pH through decarboxylation. The ability of soil to return to the original pH was less with increased rate of acid addition and was not restored at the highest addition rates. Organic anions increased pH of both soils. Soil pH increased with increasing proportion of organic anion when organic acids and anions were added together to the soil. Glucose (R-OH) did not significantly change pH. In comparison, glucosamine hydrochloride (R-NH2) addition had no major effect on soil pH in Frankston soil (initial pH 4.44) as nitrification was inhibited at low pH, whereas in Shepparton soil (initial pH 6.20), pH subsequently decreased due to nitrification. Therefore, the results demonstrated that C compounds in plant material and initial soil pH regulates the direction and magnitude of pH change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:c0d25C_dN_AC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5124436018479439480", "cites_id": ["5124436018479439480"], "pub_url": "https://iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/2.2.2.pdf#page=166", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eB6vi2inHUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
