Effective use of these indicators requires quantification and understanding of: (1) the variability of isotope signatures of potential organic matter source materials; and (2) the influence of organic matter decomposition on isotopic signatures. While it is well-established that organic matter characteristics change during the decomposition process, there has been little direct quantification of any concurrent shifts in isotope signatures for coastal detritus. In this study, we addressed this by quantifying: (1) shifts in sample composition using solid-state 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy; and (2) shifts in \u03b413C and \u03b415N signatures of coastal plant tissues from field litterbag experiments. We observed significant shifts in 13C NMR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:VoB_afVdn6EC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3179488425741445457", "cites_id": ["3179488425741445457"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-022-00890-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UenIp-DPHywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
