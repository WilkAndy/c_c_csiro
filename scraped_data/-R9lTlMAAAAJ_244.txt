Carbon is continuously cycled in soil and therefore stocks can change over relatively short time scales in response to changes in land use and management (and changes in temperature and precipitation regimes). In general, losses of carbon can occur faster than gains. Concern over climate change is prompting nations, organisations, and individuals to implement actions to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sequester carbon.However, there is currently no standardised system recommended for use in New Zealand, meaning there is a risk that poor study design and sampling methods may lead to data being of limited value. There is, therefore, an urgent need to reach consensus on the most appropriate method (s) to benchmark and monitor changes in soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) at the farm scale in New Zealand. It is also important to clearly outline the expertise required, as well as the costs associated with implementation of farm-scale SOCS measurements. Development and documentation of such a system will enable landowners/managers to make more informed decisions on whether to and how to implement SOCS benchmarking and monitoring. Use of a consistent approach will enable easy comparison between farms and scaling to industry, regional and national initiatives (and vice versa)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:uk0w_JccWH8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5993041398338514044", "cites_id": ["5993041398338514044"], "pub_url": "http://www.agmatters.nz/assets/Reports/On-farm-soil-carbon-benchmarking-and-monitoring-approach_final-report_June2019-v2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fGwtOGaPK1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
