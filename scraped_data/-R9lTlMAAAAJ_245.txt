SOM supports soil structure, moisture and nutrient sorption/retention, and biological processes central to nutrient cycling and to disease suppression. However, it is widely recognised that agricultural production leads to a decline in SOM stocks. For Australian agricultural soils, SOM decline in the top 10 cm is estimated between 20% and 70%, with average SOM stocks about half that of native system soils (Baldock 2019). Declining SOM content can lead to more vulnerable production systems, impairing the ability of the soil to perform key soil functions, including nitrogen supply through the growing season.There is considerable interest in identifying management practices that build SOM. The principles of conservation agriculture typically align with goals of retaining and building SOM. These include minimising disturbance, maximising crop diversity/rotation, minimising fallow/bare ground, and integrating livestock where possible. Although changes in land-use (eg cropping to pasture) are commonly shown to change SOM content, it remains difficult to identify individual practices within a production system that have a consistent effect on SOM across different soil environments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:rv71eUSj1K8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12318543209612680082", "cites_id": ["12318543209612680082"], "pub_url": "https://grdc.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/395016/Paper-Macdonald-Lynne-Goondi-and-Barellan-Updates-2020.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kptDX8hB9KoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
