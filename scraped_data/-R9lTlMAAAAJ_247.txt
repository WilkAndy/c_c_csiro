As the capacity of a soil to deliver N declines, increased rates of fertiliser N will be required and optimising profit (where marginal benefit= marginal cost) may move to lower yields.N balance calculations are essential to define how management is altering the stock of soil N. A range of indices exist that can be monitored over time to provide an indication of how management is affecting N stocks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_sH1KHQ1xKcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16663576367144605736", "cites_id": ["16663576367144605736"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16663576367144605736&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KJg_I2vqQOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
