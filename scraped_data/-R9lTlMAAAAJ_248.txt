The initialization and/or parameterization of soil carbon models can vary among studies even when the same model and dataset are used, causing potential uncertainties in projections. 5 Although a few studies have assessed such uncertainties, it is yet unclear what these uncertainties are correlated with and how they change across varying environmental and management conditions. Here, applying a process-based biogeochemical model to 90 individual field experiments (ranging from 5 to 82 years of experimental duration) across the Australian cereal-growing regions, we demonstrated that well-designed cal-10 ibration procedures enabled the model to accurately simulate changes in measured carbon stocks, but did not guarantee convergent forward projections (100 years). Major causes of the projection uncertainty were due to insufficient understanding of how microbial processes and soil carbon composition change to modulate carbon turnover. For a given site, the uncertainty significantly increased with the magnitude of future 15 carbon input and years of the projection. Across sites, the uncertainty correlated positively with temperature, but negatively with rainfall. On average, a 331% uncertainty in projected carbon sequestration ability can be inferred in Australian agricultural soils. This uncertainty would increase further if projections were made for future warming and drying conditions. Future improvement in soil carbon modeling should focus on 20 how microbial community and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:yyP9NS4UN-AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6140901088108346272", "cites_id": ["6140901088108346272"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/12/4245/2015/bgd-12-4245-2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oPuB9QDdOFUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
