There are environmental consequences for excessive fertilizer application to crops, including greenhouse gas emissions, hypoxic \u201cdead zones,\u201d and health problems from N runoff into groundwater. The increase in corn acreage in response to demand for alternative fuels (ie ethanol) could exacerbate these problems, and divert food supplies to fuel production. A potential substitute for grain ethanol that could reduce some of these impacts is cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol feedstocks include grasses (switchgrass), hardwoods, and crop residues (eg corn stover, wheat straw). It has been assumed that these feedstocks will require similar N fertilization rates to grain biofuel crops to maximize yields, but carbohydrate yield versus N application has not previously been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7206387405084800765", "cites_id": ["7206387405084800765"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.B23D0421G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_bbt8Sk7AmQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
