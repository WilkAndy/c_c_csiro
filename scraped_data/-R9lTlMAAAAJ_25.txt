The use of MS for this purpose is made possible by the electrospray technique which successfully ionizes polar, nonvolatile organic molecules. Another recently developed ion source, atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), extends MS capabilities to less polar molecules. This article presents early results on the application of APPI MS to natural organic matter. We compare APPI MS and electrospray MS data for dissolved organic matter from Lake Drummond (Virginia, USA). Collectively, electrospray and APPI MS identify more than 6000 molecular species to which we assign unique molecular formulas. Fewer than 1000 molecular species are common to both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:nnVijz9KPVYC", "num_citations": 259, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17088336670716865178", "cites_id": ["17088336670716865178"], "pub_url": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lom.2009.7.81", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mipcBKr3Je0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 20, "2016": 17, "2017": 22, "2018": 22, "2019": 22, "2020": 37, "2021": 31, "2022": 39, "2023": 13}}
