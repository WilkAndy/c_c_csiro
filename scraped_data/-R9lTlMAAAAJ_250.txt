Results from most agricultural field trials indicate a relative increase in soil carbon stocks with the adoption of various improved management practices. However, the few available studies with time series data suggest that this relative gain is often due to a reduction or cessation of soil carbon losses rather than an actual increase in carbon stocks. Based on this observation, we argue here that stock change data from agricultural field trials may have limited predictive power when the state of the soil carbon system is unknown and that current IPCC accounting methodologies based on these trial results may not properly credit these activities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6084165622905998400", "cites_id": ["6084165622905998400"], "pub_url": "https://iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/0754.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QIz0E2ZMb1QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1}}
