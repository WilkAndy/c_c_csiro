The potential benefits to plant growth of concentrating fertilizer in localized zones were demonstrated by examining the production of annual crops. Tree heights and diameters measured prior to fertilization and annually for four years after fertilization were used to calculate biomass production. Results indicated that fertilization enhanced biomass production, and the magnitude of the increases became greater with time. The type of nitrogen applied had no appreciable effect on growth, but banding of fertilizer enhanced biomass production by up to 30 per cent compared to broadcasting fertilizer. Nutrient mobility was also shown to be affected by soil characteristics. 6 refs., 3 figs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12457801161966368282", "cites_id": ["12457801161966368282"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/272574", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GjZ0DScA46wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
