The default methodology for estimating carbon stock changes in woody biomass is provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2. 1. This section elaborates this methodology with respect to estimating changes in carbon stocks in biomass in Cropland Remaining Cropland.The change in biomass is only estimated for perennial woody crops. For annual crops, increase in biomass stocks in a single year is assumed equal to biomass losses from harvest and mortality in that same year-thus there is no net accumulation of biomass carbon stocks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:5MWWCdJses0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3455514846039915022", "cites_id": ["3455514846039915022"], "pub_url": "https://agritrop.cirad.fr/593336/1/593336.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DjpMwnF09C8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
