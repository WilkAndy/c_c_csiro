Land use and land use change may induce a sequestration or emission of carbon depending on the balance between carbon additions (CA) derived from plant growth or the addition of organic amendments and losses associated with the mineralisation of organic materials during decomposition (CM) or material transfers associated with erosion (CE) or leaching (CL) as delineated by Baldock (2007)(Equation [1]). Initiating agricultural production has typically, but not always, resulted in net losses of soil organic carbon accounting for between 20-70% of the carbon stocks originally present (Luo et al., 2010; Lal, 2004). However, the introduction of soil carbon friendly management strategies including soil conservation programs, reduced tillage, residue retention and increased productivity have resulted in reductions in the magnitude of soil carbon loss (avoided emissions) or increases in carbon stock (sequestration)(Hutchinson et al., 2007; Sanderman et al., 2010)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:FGCrkofroJsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15151449090690731440", "cites_id": ["15151449090690731440"], "pub_url": "https://jahnresearchgroup.cals.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/200/2017/08/4.-Integrating-soil-carbon-stocks-across-point-to-continental-scales-V3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sE0JE6zCRNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
