Recently, and with particular reference to increased awareness of climatic change, there has been focus on increasing sequestration of C in agricultural soils as a potential greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. However, increased C content in soils often also leads to an increased rate of both C and N cycling. In the context of C accounting and defining the net greenhouse gas benefits of sequestering atmospheric CO2-C in soil, it is important to understand the potential implications of building soil C on the flux of N2O generated by N cycling processes (Zaehle et al. 2011)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:i4l3h6Pr8ZgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1235752693406432108", "cites_id": ["1235752693406432108"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Farrell-9/publication/312044643_The_influence_of_increasing_organic_matter_content_on_N2O_emissions/links/586cb6ad08ae6eb871bb7f99/The-influence-of-increasing-organic-matter-content-on-N2O-emissions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bPu4AIdGJhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
