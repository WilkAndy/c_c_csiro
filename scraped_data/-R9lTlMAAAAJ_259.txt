The study area is the Cox\u2019s Creek catchment in northern New South Wales. Soil carbon data was available for the 2000-2002 time period. Initial carbon pools were determined after running the RothC in equilibrium mode for 10,000 years under constant environmental conditions and interactively changing residual inputs considering three soil types under native vegetation. Then using these initial pools, land management information and observed weather data, simulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) was carried out across the catchment from 1970 to 2000. The greatest mean predicted SOC for year 2000 was recorded for pasture on Tenosols while the smallest was recorded for forest and pasture on Vertosols. Model validation was done based on the actual measurement done in 2000-2002. Overall predictions were poor (RMSE of 0.86%). In addition Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient was low between predicted SOC vs. measured SOC (r"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:mN77zE6YZBUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12549563348509134040", "cites_id": ["12549563348509134040"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick-Michael/publication/352362280_2012-AUSNZ-conference-proceedings/links/60c5a2bd92851ca6f8e57720/2012-AUSNZ-conference-proceedings.pdf#page=377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2AwmAmABKa4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
