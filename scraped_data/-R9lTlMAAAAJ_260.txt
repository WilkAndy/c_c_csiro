The study area was the Cox\u2019s Creek catchment in northern NSW, Australia. The legacy data were collected in 2000\u20132002 (referred to as 2000) and re-sampling was carried out in 2010. A linear model of co-regionalization was fitted to the datasets. There was no evidence found for spatial cross-correlation between two time periods. Therefore, two separate linear mixed models were fitted. Globally there is a decrease in soil carbon content across the catchment. Out of the total area, 6 km2 (0.4%) was estimated to have experienced statistically significant change in soil carbon at the 0.05 probability level while there was 17 km2 (1.2%) at 0.10 probability level. Statistically significant changes in soil carbon were mainly recorded in the forested areas of the catchment, specifically in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15753697117022873121", "cites_id": ["15753697117022873121"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15753697117022873121&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IWY-rw9goNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
