Analytical thermal analysis has been proposed as a relatively rapid, inexpensive method for SOM characterization that requires no pre-treatment, but is challenging due to a lack of direct information about chemical composition. The goal of this study was to inform the interpretation of coupled differential scanning calorimetry and evolved gas analyses (DSC, CO2-EGA) using spectral correlations with solid phase 13C NMR data. We used a subset of soils collected as part of the Australian National Soil Carbon Research Program (SCaRP), which were physically fractionated and characterized using conventional analytical methods.
