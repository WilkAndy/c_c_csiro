Some studies in the literature ignore the effect of microbial population growth on carbon decomposition rates. In reality, we might expect that the decomposition rate should be related to the population of microbes in the soil and have a positive relationship with the size of the microbial biomass pool. In this study, we explore the effect of microbial population growth on the accuracy of modelling soil carbon sequestration by developing and comparing two soil carbon models that consider a carrying capacity and limit to the growth of the microbial pool. We apply our models to three datasets, two small and one large datasets, and we select the best model in terms of having the best predictive performance through two model selection methods. Through this analysis we reveal that commonly used complex soil carbon models can over-fit in the presence of both small and large time-series datasets, and our simpler model can produce more accurate predictions. We conclude that considering the microbial population growth in a soil carbon model improves the accuracy of a model in the presence of a large dataset."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:sJRvXmEhuqoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12368643620482652574", "cites_id": ["12368643620482652574"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01564", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nhlFSNc_pqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
