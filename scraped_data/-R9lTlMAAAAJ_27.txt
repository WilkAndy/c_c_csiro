Section 3 presents' first-principles' approach, which is used to address soil carbon sequestration potential by way of a review of the mechanisms of carbon capture and stabilization in agricultural soils. Section 4 discusses some of the difficulties in accurately measuring change in SOC stocks. Finally, a theoretical basis for potential sequestration due to agricultural management improvements and a summary of field evidence for stocks changes both in Australia and abroad, are given in Section 5."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 258, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13375521867415534978", "cites_id": ["13375521867415534978"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103268710", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gr3FmEVmn7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 18, "2013": 26, "2014": 31, "2015": 32, "2016": 18, "2017": 20, "2018": 23, "2019": 13, "2020": 22, "2021": 23, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
