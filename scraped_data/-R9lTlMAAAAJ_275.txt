Australia has completed projects examining how to measure SOC stocks and monitor temporal changes. A method exists to allow landowners to receive financial rewards for accumulating additional carbon in their soils. The main features of the method are presented. A significant soil sampling project was completed to quantify the impact of management practice on SOC stocks across Australia's intensive agricultural zone. Significant variations in SOC stocks within management practices limited the ability to make conclusive statements about practice impacts. The SOC stock data generated, when combined with other data, has enabled maps of SOC stocks and certainty to be created which now underpin the soil component of Australia's National Inventory Report. A framework integrating measurement, monitoring and prediction of the magnitude and certainty of the outcomes of management practices on SOC stock that can evolve and improve over time will be presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:pWGfWVkwqDsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10333790770270163182", "cites_id": ["10333790770270163182"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20183237173", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7tApbfT_aI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
