Residues of three important crop species, canola, chickpea and wheat, differing in alkalinity content and C to N ratio were incorporated into columns containing either Podosol (initial pH 4.5) or Tenosol (initial pH 6.2) soil. Net alkalinity production over the 27-month study depended on soil and residue type. Maximal alkalinity generated at 3 months by canola and chickpea residues was related to the alkalinity content (excess cation concentration) in the residues. Low initial pH reduced the rate and magnitude of alkalinity production. Amendment with wheat residue had little effect on alkalinity change. Net nitrification and nitrate leaching from 3 to 27 months reversed alkalinity generated during the initial period. However, a net increase in alkalinity was still observed in residue-amended soils 27 months after the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13088210629385412881", "cites_id": ["13088210629385412881"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-5634-2_85", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EWECHjmqorUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
