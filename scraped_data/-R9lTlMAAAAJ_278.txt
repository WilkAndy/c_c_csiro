Preferential sampling designs deliver unbiased estimates of mean and sampling variance and will ease the burden of data collection but at what cost to our design efficiency? Preferential sampling has the potential to either increase or decrease sampling variance depending on the application. We carry out a simulation study to gauge what effect it will have when sampling Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) values in a large agricultural region in south-eastern Australia. Preferential sampling in this region can reduce the distance to travel by up to 16%. Our study is based on a dataset of predicted SOC values produced from a datamining exercise. We consider three designs and two ways to determine ease of access. The overall conclusion is that sampling performance deteriorates as the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2768557904842719247", "cites_id": ["2768557904842719247"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2768557904842719247&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DwBA-r7kayYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
