It aims to review studies which have utilized this technique to characterize chemical changes associated with the decomposition of forest organic materials including wood, forest litter, and peat. Decomposition processes can be influenced by environmental parameters such as temperature, and water content. As rubbed fiber content decreased and the extent of decomposition increased, changes in chemical composition observed by T. E. Hammond et al. for each type of peat were similar. The compositional changes observed for forest litter and peat are consistent with results of wood decomposition and allow some inferences to be made. For forest litter and peat, increases in alkyl carbon (C) content were always associated with decreases in O\u2010alkyl (carbohydrate) C content.
