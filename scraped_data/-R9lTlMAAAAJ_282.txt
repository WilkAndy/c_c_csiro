Proceedings of the 11th Australian Agronomy Conference, Australian Society of Agronomy", "pages": "2-6", "abstract": "Power laws describe the relationships between the number N (s) and the size s of daily rainfall events, ie N (s)~ s-\u03c4; higher \u03c4 corresponds to greater frequency of small rainfall events. We tested the hypothesis that soil nitrogen is mineralised faster in sites or periods with high \u03c4. Daily rates of nitrogen mineralisation on a sandy loam soil were calculated using simulation models for (a) uncropped soils in six Mallee locations, and (b) wheat crops in 39 locations in an EW transect in the southeastern wheat-belt. Rates were calculated using actual rainfall, and variable or fixed temperature and evaporative demand. In the Mallee, the annual pattern of mineralisation rate, calculated as a function of rainfall and variable temperature and evaporative demand, was bimodal with peaks in April and November. These peaks disappeared and differences among locations were reduced when the effects of temperature and evaporative demand were removed. Under constant temperature and evaporative demand, mineralisation rates between April and November were 68% greater than rates between December and March. In the former period, characterised by a high frequency of small rainfall events, monthly mineralisation rate was a direct function of the amount of rainfall. In contrast, mineralisation was independent of the amount of rainfall during the period of larger, less frequent rainfall events from December to March. Parameter \u03c4 accounted for 75% of the variation in mineralisation rate in the period December-March and accounted for a substantial part of the variation between periods. In the EW transect, mineralisation rate was higher than expected from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5846362376174047833", "cites_id": ["5846362376174047833"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2003/p/6/sadras.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WRIQFJtzIlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
