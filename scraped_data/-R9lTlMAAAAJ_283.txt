No growth response resulted from the addition of potassium, but the addition of phosphorus produced significant growth increase . Shoot to root ratio remained constant across levels of phosphorus, however, when phosphorus was deficient, both dry matter and phosphorus were selectively partitioned to the leaves at the expense of the stems. 7 refs., 5 figs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11060331904663555591", "cites_id": ["11060331904663555591"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/272576", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Bw5kY0QxfpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
