The implementation of continuous grain-corn cropping systems has been shown to alter such structural characteristics as aggregate size distribution, aggregate stability, soil compressibility and pore size distribution. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of 5 cropping treatments, ranging from continuous grain-corn (15 years) to continuous bromegrass (15 years), on the water-stable aggregate size distribution (WSASD) of a silt loam. In an attempt to gain some insight into the nature of the binding agents present in the soils, the WSASD was also measured subsequent to the application of 6 chemical treatments: control, water, 0.08 M NaNO~, 0.08 M NaCI, 0.08 M Na3P04, and 0.02 M Na4P204 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3777639249796575281", "cites_id": ["3777639249796575281"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3777639249796575281&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MbCyBeLebDQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1}}
