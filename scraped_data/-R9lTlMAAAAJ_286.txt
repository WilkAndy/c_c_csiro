Lignite has a demonstrated capacity to suppress ammonia (NH3) volatilisation from manure and this has been attributed to the pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH buffer capacity and labile carbon (C) content of the lignite. Whilst lignite is effective in mitigating NH3 loss, the capacity for N retention and how this is influenced by the lignite's properties are not well studied. It is unclear if lignites from different mines will have comparable N retention under similar conditions. In this study, we characterised five Victorian lignites for their C-containing functional groups, surface morphology and chemical properties. These were then related to the ammonium () adsorption capacity of the lignites using a batch isotherm technique. The contribution of biological immobilisation to the N retention capacity of the lignites was determined using 15N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:4givWmz5LegC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593330.2022.2048315", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uGH0vt7oW84J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
