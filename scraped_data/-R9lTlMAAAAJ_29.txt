In this study the effects of repeated drying-rewetting (DRW) cycles on phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) pulses and microbial biomass were investigated. Soil (Chromic Luvisol) was amended with different C substrates (glucose, cellulose, starch; 2.5 g C kg\u22121) to manipulate the size and community composition of the microbial biomass, thereby altering P mineralisation and immobilisation and the forms and availability of P. Subsequently, soils were either subjected to three DRW cycles (1 week dry/1 week moist) or incubated at constant water content (70% water filled pore space). Rewetting dry soil always produced an immediate pulse in respiration, between 2 and 10 times the basal rates of the moist incubated controls, but respiration pulses \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 250, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13527317515999909310", "cites_id": ["13527317515999909310"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071709001266", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vhUYKZyvursJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 17, "2011": 20, "2012": 11, "2013": 16, "2014": 20, "2015": 22, "2016": 21, "2017": 17, "2018": 17, "2019": 20, "2020": 20, "2021": 14, "2022": 26, "2023": 9}}
