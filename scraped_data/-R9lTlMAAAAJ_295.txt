Yet, soil degradation continues and farmers face various barriers in maintaining and enhancing SOC levels (in short,\u2018SOC management\u2019). To date, a systematic review of these constraints and barriers is lacking. To tackle this gap, the CIRCASA project carried out a stakeholder dialogue on challenges, opportunities, and knowledge needs related to SOC management. This dialogue involved 11 workshops worldwide (235 participants), exchanges with a stakeholder advisory board, a global survey targeting farmers and other stakeholders including researchers, government authorities, farm advisors, policy makers and members of NGOs, associations and industry (1369 usable answers) and a survey with Danish farmers (1807 usable responses, representative of Danish farming structure).Earlier analysis carried out in the CIRACSA project showed that stakeholders perceive a lack of knowledge around SOC management as a key barrier to scaling up beneficial practices and that improved knowledge creation and exchange is seen as a central solution to further the uptake of SOC management. In this report, we examine knowledge gaps identified by stakeholders. In this way, the findings support the creation of an international strategic research agenda for SOC, a central envisioned outcome of the CIRCASA project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:lVu93_cgYy4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agritrop.cirad.fr/596133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ewOsoGQOwVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
