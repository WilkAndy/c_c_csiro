However, the degree to which SOC is affected by land-use type over the short\u2014(< 10-years) and long\u2014(\u2265 10-years) term remains relatively uncertain. Moreover, there is limited data on the distribution of SOC across particulate (POC), humus (HOC) and resistant (ROC) fractions, and the responses of these fractions to land-use. Using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithms generated from the Australian Soil Carbon Research Program (SCaRP), soil organic carbon (TOC, POC, HOC and ROC) was estimated across 280 paired samples across Australia\u2019s Northern Grains Regions. Our analysis covered five land-use types: remnant native vegetation, long-term pasture (\u2265 10-years), short-term pasture (< 10-years), short-term cropping (< 10-years) and long-term cropping (\u2265 10-years).
