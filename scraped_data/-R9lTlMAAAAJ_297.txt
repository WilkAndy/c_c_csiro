The dominant forms that SOC have accumulated in can matter as much as the total stock for predicting SOC response to perturbations. For example, a soil with a large fraction of SOC in particulate forms will be more vulnerable to carbon loss than a soil with the same amount of SOC but much of the SOC is found in resistant forms. The labor and cost of applying a robust fractionation scheme severely limits the number of soil samples than can be fractionated particularly when you are interested in quantifying carbon that is pyrogenic in origin. Fortunately, chemometric models based on diffuse reflectance mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy have been shown to successfully predict these fractions. Here, we have extended and applied MIR-predictive models for particulate, humus and resistant organic carbon forms based on a combination of size fractionation and NMR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:FTNwVkz-CAMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B42D..07S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
