Soil C stocks in grassland are influenced by fire, grazing intensity, fertilizer management, liming, irrigation, re-seeding with more or less productive grass species and mixed swards with N-fixing legumes (Conant et al., 2001; Follett et al., 2001; Ogle et al., 2004). In addition, drainage of organic soils for grassland management causes losses of soil organic C (Armentano and Menges, 1986)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:4z9AjAXnHeAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/107141/Grassland.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0FIpCl5dvUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
