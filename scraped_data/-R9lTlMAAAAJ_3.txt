Char C is considered biologically inert relative to other forms of organic C in soils; however, the degree of biological inertness is likely to be a function of the extent that the combustion residues were altered during thermal treatment. The relationship between changes in chemical composition and biological inertness of char C created in the laboratory by heating Pinus resinosa sapwood to temperatures between 70 and 350 \u00b0C was quantified. Heating at each temperature was maintained until the mass of the residual char material stabilised (\u00b12%). Chemical composition of the chars was assessed by elemental analysis, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT). The susceptibility of the heated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 1148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14849062623053597758", "cites_id": ["14849062623053597758"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638002000621", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PsyjLsh3Es4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 5, "2004": 18, "2005": 20, "2006": 25, "2007": 33, "2008": 41, "2009": 49, "2010": 59, "2011": 73, "2012": 100, "2013": 83, "2014": 83, "2015": 93, "2016": 82, "2017": 77, "2018": 70, "2019": 60, "2020": 60, "2021": 55, "2022": 40, "2023": 17}}
