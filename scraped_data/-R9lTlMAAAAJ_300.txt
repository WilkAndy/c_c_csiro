In macroecology, increased biodiversity results in increased ecosystem functionality (eg, productivity, SOM accumulation), which has been explained by greater community niche breadth. Translating these concepts to microbial communities, we predicted that greater species richness would result in greater rates of C cycling and SOM formation, a trend underpinned by a relationship between richness, access to substrates, and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:3eH_u9Md8IkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B33O2892E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
