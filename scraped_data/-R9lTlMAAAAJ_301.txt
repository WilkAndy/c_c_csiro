Whilst such impacts are notoriously difficult to directly quantify, transects allow a space-for-time comparison, where spatial gradients in aridity or other variables can be observed and provide an indication of changes that are likely to occur with similar temporal climatic change.This study used a transect established under the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) along the Adelaide geosyncline that runs for 900 km from Cape Jervis in the south to Murnpeowie Station, 150 km north of Arkaroola Wildlife Sanctuary at the head of the Flinders Ranges in the north of South Australia. It covers a rainfall gradient of nearly 900 mm difference, and thus provides an excellent tool with which to assess linkages between climate, vegetation community structure, soil microbial community composition and function, and soil organic matter chemistry, that can provide insights into the likely changes we can expect within this system under future climatic change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:5bGIVMdsOr0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/147603/3/147603%20-%20Proceedings-Natl.-Soil-Sci-Conf-Canberra.pdf#page=351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9HqxRe-J8ZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
