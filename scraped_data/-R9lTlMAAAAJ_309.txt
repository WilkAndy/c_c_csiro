At over 1400 sites, surface SOC storage was driven by precipitation, whereas SOC depth distribution (0-30 cm) was influenced by land-use. Based upon these findings, 100 sites were selected for profile analysis (up to 1 m) of SOC and its component fractions-particulate (POC), humus (HOC) and resistant (ROC) organic carbon. Profile SOC content was modelled using an exponential model describing surface SOC content, SOC depth distribution and residual SOC at depth and the drivers of these parameters investigated via machine learning. Corroborating previous findings, surface SOC content was highly influenced by rainfall, whereas SOC depth distribution was influenced by land-use. At depth, site properties \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:2hxEYnSErgUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.B32E..05H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
