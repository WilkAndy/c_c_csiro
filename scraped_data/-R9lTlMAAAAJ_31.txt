The index can also be used to estimate crop carbon (C) balances by applying it to grain yield statistics to determine total shoot dry matter and then calculating crop residues as the difference between shoot C and grain C. Such an approach is widely used in C-accounting systems. Such a C-accounting practice is sensitive to changes in HI. In Australia, measured variations in HI are large enough to alter C balance calculations for some crops. Much of this variation results from the diverse range of climates and soils, which are a feature of the Australian cereal cropping region.Factors that influence crop HI include the energy and protein content of seeds, long-term breeding achievements, and extreme (either hot or cold) temperatures during crop reproductive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 241, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4178417758280523742", "cites_id": ["4178417758280523742"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211310050054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3p9-HdC4_DkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 10, "2013": 6, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 10, "2017": 19, "2018": 22, "2019": 34, "2020": 29, "2021": 38, "2022": 38, "2023": 6}}
