In Australia, grassy eucalyptus woodlands dominated by kangaroo grasses (Themeda trianda) were widely cleared during European settlement for agriculture, with only fragments remaining of this now threatened ecosystem. As remnant grassland fragments are used for livestock grazing, Themeda transitions through states of degradation, starting with red grasses (Bothriochloa spp) and then proceeding to less productive, increasingly degraded states dominated by either annual exotic weeds or native wallaby grasses (Rytidosperma spp) and spear grasses (Austrastipa spp). The aim of our experiment was to determine how soil organic matter dynamics (including erosion, root biomass, C storage and turnover) have been altered by the transition from deeply-rooted Themeda grass systems to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:p2iGfxNeIOAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.B43L..07C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
