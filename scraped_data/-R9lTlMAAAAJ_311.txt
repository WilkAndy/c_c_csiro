Here, we evaluate the major drivers of soil organic carbon storage in eastern Australia. To do this, we used a regional dataset including 1482 sites and targeting key land uses and soil management practices on major soils of New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD) and Victoria (VIC). Structural equation modeling (SEM) and conditional inference tree (CTREE) analyses were performed to evaluate the relative importance of climate, topography, soil properties, land use and soil management practices on soil organic carbon stocks in 0-30 cm. The results showed that aridity, the most important factor controlling carbon storage, had a strong negative (r=-0.82, p< 0.01), whereas clay content had a strong positive (r= 0.42, p< 0.01) relationship with soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:lAkp0ULYU5cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.8333R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
