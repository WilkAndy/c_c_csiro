Conference Proceedings", "pages": "823-826", "publisher": "Australian Society of Agronomy Inc", "abstract": "We assembled published measurements of wheat water use which included both bare soil evaporation and crop transpiration in Australia in an effort to better define the critical parameters underpinning the \u201cFrench and Schultz\u201d water use efficiency schema. We found only 19 studies which measured the critical water balance parameters of bare soil evaporation and crop transpiration. Together these studies indicate that on average 38% of crop evapotranspiration is lost to direct soil evaporation under Australian rainfed wheat crops. We can find no data to support an increase in crop productivity due to increased crop transpiration at the expense of bare soil evaporation as a function of improvements in agronomic practices in recent decades."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:q2fMW1XeUkEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2015_Conference/pdf/agronomy2015final00228.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1AtQBQAGCfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
