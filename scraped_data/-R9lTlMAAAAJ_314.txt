Up to eighty percent of net primary production may be allocated to roots in ecosystems such as grasslands, where they contribute substantially to SOM formation. On the other hand, root induced priming of SOM decomposition has been implicated in the loss of soil C stocks. Thus, the accurate prediction of climate change impacts on C sequestration in soils largely depends upon improved understanding of root-mediated SOM formation and loss in the rhizosphere. This presentation represents an initial attempt to synthesize belowground observations from free-air CO2 enrichment and warming experiments in two grassland ecosystems. We found that the chemical composition of root carbon is similar to particulate organic matter (POM), but not to mineral associated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:N-Wl9uZK064C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.B22C..02P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
