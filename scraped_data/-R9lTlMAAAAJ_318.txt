At regional or continental scales, however, it is a significant challenge to quantify the changes in SOC stock and the corresponding uncertainty associated with variation of cropping systems and environmental conditions at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, our aim was to predict changes in SOC stock after adopting different cropping systems under optimal management for sequestering soil carbon (ie, no nutrient deficiency and 100% residue retention) and quantify the relevant uncertainties at regional scale. Using the farming systems model APSIM, we simulated changes in SOC stocks for a 20-year period from 1990 to 2010 under a total of 59 cropping systems at 613 references sites across the Australian cereal-growing regions. These cropping systems were identified based on GRDC agro-ecological zones through expert consultation. To further understand the effects of cropping system in terms of carbon input on SOC dynamics, those cropping systems were divided into three categories to represent low-, medium-and high-input cropping systems in terms of carbon input. The simulation results indicated that, on average, the Australian agricultural soils could gain 0.19 t C ha\u20131 yr\u20131 under optimal management. However, the predicted change in SOC stocks had high variability among the three carbon-input categories. Generally, cropping systems with higher carbon input had higher efficiency for reducing SOC losses or enhancing SOC gains \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/72152629/modsim.2013.h4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5YgEftrpxcoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
