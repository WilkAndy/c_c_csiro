One problem with this approach  is that if  many covariates are used in the model  it can become difficult to fit a linear model of  co-regionalization (LMCR). A more formal  approach using bivariate LMMs is more suited  (Marchant & Lark, 2007). In this approach the  covariates can be incorporated as fixed effect terms  and the auto and cross correlations can be modeled as random effects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:3z482UoT1zoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/b12728-51/mapping-temporal-change-soil-carbon-case-study-northern-new-south-wales-australia-new-south-wales-australia-karunaratne-bishop-odeh-baldock-marchant", "cites_per_year": {}}
