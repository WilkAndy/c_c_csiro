Despite differences in the distribution of C stocks and litter chemistry at these two sites, we found similar shifts in DOC chemistry with soil depth. DOC concentrations dropped rapidly with increasing depth, with an accompanying decrease in the C:N ratio, an increase in the \u03b413C value and an decrease in specific UV adsorption. In the grassland soil, \u039414C values declined from current atmospheric values (+70\u2030) in the surface horizon to \u221275\u2030 at 100 cm. In the redwood soil, the \u039414C value of 111\u2030 in O horizon leachates was indicative of OM with a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 226, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4658989147355442821", "cites_id": ["4658989147355442821"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-008-9211-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hW6F9PENqEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 9, "2011": 12, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 20, "2015": 16, "2016": 22, "2017": 14, "2018": 19, "2019": 23, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 16, "2023": 12}}
