The responses of soil C stocks to experimental manipulations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) and temperature vary widely in direction and magnitude across different ecosystems. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Biochemical inventories in biomass and soil C pools give a new perspective on ecosystem C dynamics. A comparison of biochemical stocks in the soil to the fluxes from roots and shoots (eg kg carbohydrate/m2\u00b7 yr) provide insight to C cycling mechanisms. We performed biochemical inventories for native grassland ecosystems on 3 different soil types (Mollisol, Alfisol, and Vertisol) and under varying (CO2) at the USDA CO2 Tunnel Experiment (Temple, TX). We used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance to study the chemical structure of plant tissues and soil organic matter and applied a molecular mixing model (Baldock et al., 2004) to estimate biochemical stocks. Biochemical fluxes to the soil surface were affected by soil order, through differences in net primary productivity (NPP) and plant species distribution within the community. Of the 3 soil orders, the Mollisol, a clay-rich alkaline soil, had the lowest NPP (278 g/m2\u00b7 yr) and the lowest carbohydrate fluxes to the soil surface (205 g/m2\u00b7 yr). Despite the lower inputs, the Mollisol had the highest carbohydrate stock in the soil (34% of the soil C). This suggests that the mineralogy and/or structure of the Mollisols preserve labile organic matter more efficiently than the Alfisol and Vertisol.
