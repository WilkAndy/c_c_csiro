In the Agriculture accounts, methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management, rice production, and burning of savannas and crop residues, as well as nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure management, soils and burning of savannas and crop residues are included. An accounting framework has been built to model agricultural emissions and includes the following modules; soil water balance, soil organic matter cycling, soil nitrogen cycling, annual crop/pasure growth, perennial pasture (savanna) growth, and animal growth and methane emission. For perennial pastures (including rangelands) the modules interact such that pasture growth is a function of water and nitrogen availability; animal feed intake is a function of forage available and forage nitrogen content, animal methane production is a function of intake quantity and quality, animal type and physiological state; soil carbon stocks are a balance between Cmineralisation and C input from pasture debris; and nitrous oxide emissions are a function of nitrate availability and soils water content. Details of the perennial pasture growth module are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4057235131977585180&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
