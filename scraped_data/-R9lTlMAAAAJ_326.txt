The responses of soil carbon stocks to experimental manipulations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and temperature vary widely in direction and magnitude across different ecosystems. The mechanisms for differences in soil C cycle response to climate change are not well understood. In particular, little is known about the potential role of soil genetic factors such as mineralogy and structure in the climate response. To address this, we examined [CO2]-induced changes in soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and quality at the USDA Lysimeter CO2 Gradient facility (in Temple, TX), which comprises 3 major soil orders (Mollisol, Alfisol, and Vertisol). Temperature, precipitation, and vegetation type are controlled variables across soil orders. We used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance to study the chemical structure and composition of SOM under a native tallgrass prairie community exposed to CO2 concentrations ranging from 270 to 480 ppm. A mixing model (Baldock et al., 2004) was used to estimate soil biochemical stocks. The relative magnitude of biochemical inputs (from grassland roots and shoots) follows the order: carbohydrates>> lignins> proteins= lipids. However, the relative chemical abundances in the soil C pool are: carbohydrates= protein> lipid> lignin> charcoal. These discrepancies in the relative magnitude of the biochemical fluxes and stocks highlight the selectivity of SOM preservation and show that increased primary production (mainly carbohydrate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=260992", "cites_per_year": {}}
