The responses of soil carbon stocks to experimental manipulations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) and temperature vary widely in direction and magnitude across different ecosystems. The mechanisms for differences soil C cycle response to climate change are not well understood. In particular, little is known about the potential role of soil genetic factors such as mineralogy and structure in the climate response. To address this, we examined [CO2]-induced changes in soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and quality at the USDA lysimeter CO2 gradient facility (in Temple, TX), which comprises 3 major soil orders (Mollisol, Alfisol, and Vertisol). Temperature, precipitation, and vegetation type are controlled variables across the soil orders \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.B41F0382H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
