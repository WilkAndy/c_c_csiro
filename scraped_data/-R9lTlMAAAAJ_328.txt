Awareness of the consequences of modifying management actions must be linked with the state of the resource base. This must be implemented at all scales from farm management to national public policy. An analysis is described which spatially represented the key soil condition indicators pH and organic carbon. This involved an integration of intensity of the modifying processes, the resilience of the soil and present state of the indicators. A key to the success was the inter-agency collaboration both in data acquisition, knowledge of processes and validation of the products. These products are used to inform public investment in facilitating behaviour change and soil condition monitoring programs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/CS6.pdf#page=7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R46AZKJ9TX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
