Specifically, we will explore the changes that occur during charring processes in the type and distribution of major biomolecules that constitute natural organic materials, based on information derived from 13C solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and elemental ratios. These changes are placed in context with regard to the specific combustion temperatures, the presence or absence of oxygen (O2), as well as the influence of the type of original material on the biochar end product. We will discuss the chemical aspects of biochar types produced in the laboratory as well as char from natural vegetation fires."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8557440877347518984", "cites_id": ["8557440877347518984"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781849770552-11/characteristics-biochar-organo-chemical-properties-evelyn-krull-jeff-baldock-jan-skjemstad-ronald-smernik", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CLq0gCMjwnYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 16, "2013": 24, "2014": 23, "2015": 24, "2016": 22, "2017": 15, "2018": 28, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 10}}
