However, carbon exists in soils in a diverse range of pools/fractions that differ in their chemistry and rates of turnover. Improved knowledge of the distribution of carbon (C) and nutrients (N and P) across different soil organic matter (SOM) fractions will potentially improve our understanding of drivers of the structure of the SMC, carbon utilisation and nutrient cycling functions, and predictions of nutrient mineralisation from SOM turnover. Agricultural soils collected across Southern Australia, varying in soil type and management practices, were characterised for (i) chemical composition via mid-infra red (MIR) spectroscopy;(ii) distribution of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in measurable SOM fractions;(iii) the structure of the soil bacterial and fungal communities using community DNA fingerprinting;(iv) the carbon utilisation potential of the soil microbial community (MicroResp). Using integrative multivariate analysis we explored stoichiometric relationships between abiotic and biotic properties of these soils. The results will provide greater insight into the relationship between SOM chemistry and the role of bacteria and fungi in nutrient cycling processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113307454", "cites_per_year": {}}
