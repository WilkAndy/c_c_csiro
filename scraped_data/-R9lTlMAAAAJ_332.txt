FullCAM integrates a suite of models to estimate and predict biomass, litter and soil carbon pools in forest and agricultural systems. An N cycling and N2O emissions module\u00bf is being assembled within FullCAM with the goal of improving on the emissions factor methodology currently used for GHG inventories of nitrous oxide emissions. The module is based on the hybrid process/empirical model NGAS (Parton et al. 1996; 2001). The proposed approach will require little additional information to that already used by FullCAM but is expected to improve on the current emissions factor methodology by accounting for the influence of management, soil water balance, temperature, available carbon and mineral nitrogen on nitrification and denitrification rates and nitrous oxide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:Dnd9Dw9jpwAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP092126&sb=RECENT&n=1&rpp=50&page=2&tr=5694&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2009", "cites_per_year": {}}
