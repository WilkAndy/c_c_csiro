One particularly effective way of determining the sizes of these terrestrial biosphere and ocean carbon sinks is based on the measurements of changes in atmospheric oxygen (O2) and CO2 concentrations (Keeling et al. 1996). This method of carbon apportionment requires knowledge of total fossil fuel CO2 emissions, atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations, and the value of the terrestrial biosphere oxidative ratio (OR), which has historically been assumed to be constant at 1.10 (eg Prentice et al. 2001). OR is the ratio of moles of O2 per mole of CO2 in gas exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. An incorrect estimation of the biosphere\u2019s OR results in misapportionment of CO2 between the terrestrial biosphere and ocean carbon sinks (Randerson et al. 2006 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFM.B21B0339G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
