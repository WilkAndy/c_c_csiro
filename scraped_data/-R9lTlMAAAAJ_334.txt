Lessons from Australian long-term soil experiments.", "pub_year": 2009, "citation": "AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts 2009, B34B-08, 2009", "author": "Jonathan Sanderman and Jeff Baldock and Ryan Farquharson", "journal": "AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts", "volume": "2009", "pages": "B34B-08", "abstract": "One of the greatest changes that has occurred in soils during the Anthropocene is loss of organic matter due to agriculture. This loss has resulted in both large declines in soil fertility and large emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere. On the billions of hectares in production, humans are likely the only agent that will significantly change this situation. From a theoretical standpoint, any management practice which results in greater carbon return to the soil, increased stabilisation of soil carbon, or a reduction in losses should lead to positive carbon sequestration rates. Indeed, Australian field trial evidence indicates that there was a relative gain in soil carbon between most conventional and improved-management treatments. However, when soil carbon stocks were followed through time, the majority of these same studies indicated that there was an actual decrease in the quantity of carbon stored in the soil even in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFM.B34B..08S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
