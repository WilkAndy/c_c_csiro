This challenge mainly arises from the fact that black carbon constitutes a continuum of substances with a range of different properties. Previous methods have used specific chemical property limits to define whether a certain form of carbon is considered black carbon or not. These chemical cutoff points are difficult to define. In addition, different study objectives as well as diverse environments may necessitate a range of definitions for black carbon. These constraints may make a method favorable that uses a sliding scale of organo-chemical properties that can be developed for different types of black carbon or research questions. We used synchrotron-based Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) in combination with Near-Edge X-ray Absorption \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009EGUGA..11.1039H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
