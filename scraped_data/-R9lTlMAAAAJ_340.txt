It is important to find the right combination of cover crop and fertilization rate to maximize crop yields and soil carbon sequestration, while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Fertilizer addition changes the nutrient status of an ecosystem, and can alter a plant's biochemical composition (ie percentage carbohydrates, lignin, lipids, and proteins) as well as biomass allocation (ie grain, reproductive parts, leaves & stems, or roots). When dealing with an agricultural ecosystem, shifts in either biochemistry or allocation can have many implications. One of most significant is the effect of plant biochemical changes on the plant litter that remains after harvest. Litter chemistry influences soil carbon pools and soil microbial communities. Here we present data from a corn agricultural ecosystem under a range of nitrogen fertilization rates (0 to 202 kg N/ha, both with a cover crop and without) at the Kellogg Biological Station-Living Field Laboratory (KBS-LFL) in Michigan, USA. We measured the plant biochemical composition of the corn using 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13 C NMR) in combination with a molecular mixing model (Baldock et al., 2004). We also measured the carbon oxidation state (C ox) of plant samples via elemental analysis (Masiello et al. 2008). C ox describes the bonding environment of carbon within the plant biomass, and can be used to calculate the oxidative ratio (ie photosynthetic quotient) of the ecosystem.We will discuss observed changes in plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14688879017660887961&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
