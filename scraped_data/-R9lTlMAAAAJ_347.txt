We have investigated molecular-level changes in the chemical composition of the organic carbon pool of a deciduous forest in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, after 9 years of free-air CO2 enrichment. We employ a novel approach based upon solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and application of a molecular mixing model. This method generates quantitative estimates of total lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lignin. 13C NMR spectra were acquired for acid-insoluble soil organic matter from depths of 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm in two ambient and two elevated [CO2] treatments. In the upper 5 cm, elevated [CO2] soils show a 7% increase in lignin, while lipids and proteins decrease by approximately 10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.B41C0645H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
