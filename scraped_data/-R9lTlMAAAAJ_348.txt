To determine controls on the age and recalcitrance of DOC found in stream waters, we measured DOC composition in stream and soil water samples, using isotopic (13C and 14C) and spectroscopic (UV and 13C NMR) analyses, in conjunction with soil hydrometric conditions in two first-order watersheds with contrasting vegetation in northern California."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43992940/A_Predictable_Terrestrial_Signature_to_R20160322-10858-1pki36j.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
