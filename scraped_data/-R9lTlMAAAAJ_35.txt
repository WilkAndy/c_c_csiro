Simple models which can provide approximations based on crop or pasture dry matter production would be useful for agrononomists and those interested in regional nitrogen (N) cycle fluxes. We investigate meta analysis of published data on legume shoot dry matter production, shoot %N and legume %N fixed (%Ndfa) and look for relationships among these, as a possible way of providing useful approximations of N2 fixation. We restricted our analysis to Australian studies where we have ready access to the primary data and where cultivars, management and climate are more constrained compared to a universal dataset. Regression analysis between shoot dry matter and amounts of shoot N2 fixed were strong for all crop and pasture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1818533175395873529", "cites_id": ["1818533175395873529"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-009-0136-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-fK7u0m6PBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 18, "2013": 20, "2014": 14, "2015": 13, "2016": 23, "2017": 23, "2018": 18, "2019": 17, "2020": 23, "2021": 16, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
