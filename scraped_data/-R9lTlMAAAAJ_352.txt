The concentration and chemistry of this stream DOC is a primarily controlled by a complex interplay between soil biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic routing. Here we present results from an intensive field and laboratory examination of DOC fluxes and chemistry within a small headwater catchment (3 ha) in a coastal California prairie ecosystem. Over the course of 2 years, DOC in soil water samples at multiple depths and at multiple hillslope locations, as well as stream water samples were chemically characterized using both isotopic (13C and 14C) and spectroscopic (UV/VIS and 13C NMR) analyses. In upland soil profiles where vertically infiltrating throughflow dominates, we find a progressive shift in DOC age and recalcitrance as water percolates through the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.B31E..03S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
