Rapid, simple and low-cost accurate methods of analysis are required to support current interests in carbon accounting. This study was completed to develop national and state-based models capable of predicting soil carbon content and composition by coupling diffuse reflectance mid-infrared (MIR) spectra with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) analyses. Total, organic and inorganic carbon contents were determined and MIR spectra acquired for 20\u2009495 soil samples collected from 4526 locations from soil depths to 1\u2009m within Australia\u2019s agricultural regions. However, all subsequent MIR/PLSR models were developed using soils only collected from the 0\u201310, 10\u201320 and 20\u201330\u2009cm depth layers. The extent of grinding applied to air-dried soil samples was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=826173603911154017", "cites_id": ["826173603911154017"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR13077", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ybnt94ModwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 22, "2016": 20, "2017": 29, "2018": 16, "2019": 24, "2020": 30, "2021": 29, "2022": 28, "2023": 9}}
