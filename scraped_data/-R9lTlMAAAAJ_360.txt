Discussion The results indicate that chlorsulfuron is inhibiting both growth and nodulation of chickpea plants. When chlorsulfuron was present only during the culture of Rhizobium (ie herbicide not present at any other stage) the number of nodules was significantly reduced when compared to the control plants. This suggests that chlorsulfuron was affecting the ability of the Rhizobium to effectively infect chickpea plant roots."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-306-47615-0_307.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
