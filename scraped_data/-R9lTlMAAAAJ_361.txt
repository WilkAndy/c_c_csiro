In order to reduce our net emissions from the land, it is necessary to adopt new management practices to lower them; increase carbon sinks through afforestation and reforestation; and minimise future emissions through limits on further deforestation. It is also necessary to understand and account for carbon exchange rates.", "pages": "1", "abstract": "AUTOTROPHIC RESPIRATION Plants fix carbon by photosynthesis. The word \u201cphotosynthesis\u201d is here used to denote the carbon fixed by gross photosynthesis minus the carbon lost by photorespiration. Some of that photosynthetically fixed carbon is lost by internal plant metabolism. This loss is termed autotrophic respiration and typically amounts to about half the carbon fixed by plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://kirschbaum.id.au/NEE_Workshop_Proceedings.pdf#page=5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3yGnoSII-MAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
