The experimental design consisted of a Latin square with two blocks. Stem height and root collar diameter were measured after four growing seasons and 102 trees were harvested for biomass determination, detailed crown and stem measurement, leaf area and nutrient analysis. Results indicate that individual trees increase their productivity per unit of resources despite competitive stress. Also, it was found that when spacing is around 1.0 m, a small change of about 10 cm can apparently make a big difference in total productivity. 17 refs., 5 figs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:a67U_wXq1t0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/272571", "cites_per_year": {}}
