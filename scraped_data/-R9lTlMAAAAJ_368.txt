In the course of this study trees were sprayed on a yearly basis with glyphosphate, and the effects of the treatment on biomass and foliar nutrient concentrations were assessed. Statistical analysis showed significant treatment effects both on tree biomass and foliar nutrient concentrations. Weed control without fertilizer improved biomass production to about the same extent as fertilizer without weed control. Best yield was achieved when weed control and fertilizer were applied together. Broadcasting the fertilizer yielded significantly more biomass than banding. 12 refs., 8 figs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/272575", "cites_per_year": {}}
