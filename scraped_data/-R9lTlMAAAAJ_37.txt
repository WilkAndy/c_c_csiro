Soil water content, organic carbon, temperature and pH are often used in models that predict N2O emissions, yet for each of these factors there are concepts that are not fully understood. Though a ubiquitous measure of soil water for models, the application of functions based on water filled pore space across soils that vary in bulk density is not ideal. Diffusion of gases and solutes in soil are controlled by the volume fractions of air and water present. Across soils with different bulk densities, both of these terms vary at constant water filled pore space. Soil organic carbon influences N2O emissions in two ways: as a source of energy for denitrifiers and also by driving biological oxygen demand and the creation of anaerobic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 212, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6613227004236320177", "cites_id": ["6613227004236320177"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-007-9485-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sc2GBuzmxlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 11, "2011": 15, "2012": 16, "2013": 22, "2014": 20, "2015": 13, "2016": 21, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
