While that theme continues into this eighth conference, the focus has been directed to the single factor that in many ways describes, defines, and delineates the study of forest soils as a unique niche in the broader continuum of soil science. In their preface to the proceedings of the third North American Forest Soils Conference CT Youngberg and CB Davey noted that \u201cthe growth of the tree and the productivity of the forest are directly affected by the quantity, quality and location of the soil.\u201d Soil carbon in its myriad forms, perhaps as no other factor, influences soil-plant relationships through its direct and indirect impacts on mineral solubility, exchange capacity, nutrient availability, moisture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:cTdzRpWJKHEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/1995.carbonforms", "cites_per_year": {}}
