The method presented here is based on thermal oxidation combined with partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modelling as applied to a set of 74 soil samples with widely varying soil properties. Reference carbon fraction data (part of the national Mid Infrared carbon fraction calibration data set), required for building the dependent variables in PLSR calibration models, was obtained from CSIRO (Agriculture and Food) and combined with thermally fractionated carbon (% C as evolved CO 2) as independent variables analytical data. The soil TOC, POC, HUM and ROC content was in the range of 2-30, 0.04-14, 1-20, 1-13 g/kg respectively. Thermal carbon was analysed at varying temperature set points by ramping temperatures from 110\u2103 to 1000\u2103 with pre-determine temperature increments and time intervals using Leco\u00ae RC612 carbon analyser.Samples were split into two sets for PLSR analysis using the Kennard-Stone algorithm: 54 samples for calibration and 20 for validation. For PLS modelling, carbon measured (evolved as CO 2) at different temperature set points were used as x matric and soil carbon fractions were used as y matrices. Leave-one-out cross validation for the calibration set resulted in R 2 values of 0.99, 0.83, 0.88 and 0.74 for TOC, POC, HUM and ROC with the corresponding Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.66, 1.27, 1.81 and 0.83 respectively.
