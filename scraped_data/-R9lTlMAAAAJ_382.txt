The programme has been designed to examine variations in soil organic carbon (SOC) content and composition in the 0 to 30 cm layer of soil due to agricultural management practices in numerous regions around Australia. For all samples, SOC content is measured directly and its distribution amongst three major SOC fractions (eg particulate-C, humus-C and char-C) is estimated by a combination of physical size fractionation and solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy aided by mid-infrared red (MIR) spectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression analysis. Detailed management histories are collected at all sites along with other potential determinants of SOC content and composition such as climate, soil type and topography."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:MU1jWE1llqsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://csiropedia.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/SAF-SCaRP-methods.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
