It is suggested that an outstanding knowledge on this aspect may contribute to a better management of tropical humid soils for agroecosystem production, since most of their productivity are controlled by organic matter status in soils. In this study, chemistry of soil Corg of two ultisols collected from a humid tropical region was studied by an advanced technique, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. Unlike to previous approaches that using destructive techniques, the method used here capable of studying in situ (non-destructive/intact) soil sample, hence allow an actual chemical status of soil Corg to be examined. It has been found that this method perhaps the most powerful technique in studying chemical aspects of Corg in soils.The specific objectives in this study were:(i) to characterize the chemical composition of soils studied,(ii) to eliminate the limiting factor during the spectroscopical analysis due to high contents of paramagnetic materials and low Corg in soils,(iii) to study the reliability of spectra obtained from soils studied and (iv) to link possible relationship between the chemical composition of Corg and their site productivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:HM9HXerLlEkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/53763919/Characterisation_of_soil_Corg_chemistry_20170704-27086-ltb9qy.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
