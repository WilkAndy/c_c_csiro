O2 Eq. 2 Depending on the form of N used (NH4+, atmospheric nitrogen (N2), or NO3-; Eq. 4-6), plant ORstock will vary by a constant times the N: C ratio of the plant (note that to maintain charge balance, NH3 and HNO3 are used in calculations; for derivation see Masiello et al. 2008). For a given plant composition, ORstock values can vary by up to 0.08 units (comparing N source endmembers NH3 and HNO3; Masiello et al. 2008). Masiello et al.(2008) provided a sensitivity analysis for the N2 assumption, showing that using the N2-only assumption (Eq. 5) for an ecosystem that receives up to 20% of its N as HNO3 results in a decrease in ORstock of 0.01 OR units."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:qqRC41JmxUcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeffrey-Baldock/publication/271922450_Controls_on_the_oxidative_ratio_of_net_primary_production_in_agricultural_ecosystems/links/5641cbab08aebaaea1f873e9/Controls-on-the-oxidative-ratio-of-net-primary-production-in-agricultural-ecosystems.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:C5IZYtpqtlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
