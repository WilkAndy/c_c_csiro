Here we show that the molecular composition of a diverse range of natural organic materials could be inferred from 13C NMR analysis combined with C and N analysis. Forty-six different organic materials including undecomposed and decomposed plant materials, soil organic matter, phytoplankton, and the organic matter found in freshwater, estuarine and marine sediments were examined. A mixing model simultaneously solved a series of equations to estimate the content of four biomolecule components representing the organic materials produced in greatest abundance by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9158315199249794866", "cites_id": ["9158315199249794866"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-004-0076-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MkdYoCbfGH8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 11, "2009": 13, "2010": 14, "2011": 11, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 14, "2015": 9, "2016": 17, "2017": 19, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 18, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
