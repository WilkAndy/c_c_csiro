Soil organic carbon stocks were found to vary from 5.9 Mg C/ha in the dry interior to 230 Mg C/ha in alpine regions.The amount of carbon found in a soil is the net result of the balance between inputs and losses of carbon over many years. Inputs are dominated by the productivity of plants and the rate at which plant residues are deposited on or in the soil. Exceptions to this occur when organic materials from offsite eg manures, biosolids, composts, etc., are available to augment the rate of carbon addition from plants. Losses of carbon are associated with the process of decomposition in which a portion of the decomposing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:k_8v9Q84L5sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17612288985185081386&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Klh7o4Rra_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
