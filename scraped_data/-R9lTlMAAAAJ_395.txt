Computer models that simulate soil organic matter dynamics have been developed using conceptual pools of carbon that vary in there relative rates of decomposition. The Roth-C soil carbon model has been calibrated to accept and model methodologically defined fractions of soil organic matter (particulate organic matter, humus, and charcoal). This model has been incorporated into the FullCAM model being used in the National Carbon Accounting System for Australia. The distribution of carbon and nitrogen in the particulate, humus and charcoal fractions of soils from crop rotation trials located in the Australian Mallee at Waikerie, SA and Euston, NSW was quantified in this study. At each site three rotations representative of district practice and two more intensive cropping systems were included.
