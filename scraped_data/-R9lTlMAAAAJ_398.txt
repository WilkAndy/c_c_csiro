One key, poorly constrained gas exchange parameter is the terrestrial biosphere\u2019s oxidative ratio (OR). OR is a property of gas exchange fluxes between the atmosphere and the biosphere and is defined as the ratio of O 2 released to CO 2 fixed during net primary production. Constraining the OR of the terrestrial biosphere is critical to estimating the sizes of the terrestrial biosphere and ocean carbon sinks in anthropogenic carbon dioxide apportionment calculations (Keeling et al. 1996). Current methods to estimate OR are prone to error (Seibt et al. 2004), which can propagate into larger errors in the estimates of the sizes of the carbon sinks (Randerson et al. 2006). We have developed more accurate and precise methods (using elemental analysis and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to estimate OR from biomass chemistry (Masiello et al. 2008; Hockaday et al. 2009). To improve our estimate of terrestrial biosphere OR, OR measurements need to be made across a range of ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12905759336624360360&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
