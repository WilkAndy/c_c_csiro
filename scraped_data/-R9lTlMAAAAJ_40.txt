While the relationships between CO2 emission and soil factors are well-studied in non-salt-affected soils, little is known about soil properties controlling CO2 emission from salt-affected soils. To close this knowledge gap, non-salt-affected and salt-affected soils (0\u20130.30 m) were collected from two agricultural regions: in India (irrigation induced salinity) and in Australia (salinity associated with ground water or non-ground water associated salinity). A subset (50 Indian and 70 Australian soils) covering the range of electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in each region was used in a laboratory incubation experiment. The soils were left unamended or amended with mature wheat residues (2% w/w) and CO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 203, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9106602486896750931", "cites_id": ["9106602486896750931"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071710004608", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U3ErhrYmYX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 11, "2013": 18, "2014": 16, "2015": 15, "2016": 21, "2017": 23, "2018": 16, "2019": 18, "2020": 18, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
