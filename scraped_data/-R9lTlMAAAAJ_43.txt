Soil organic carbon models, such as the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC), that are used to estimate carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and SOC stocks at various spatial scales, do not consider the effect of salinity on CO2 emissions and may therefore over-estimate CO2 release from saline soils. Two laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to assess the effect of soil texture on the response of CO2 release to salinity, and to calculate a rate modifier for salinity to be introduced into the RothC model. The soils used were a sandy loam (18.7% clay) and a sandy clay loam (22.5% clay) in one experiment and a loamy sand (6.3% clay) and a clay (42% clay) in another experiment. The water content was adjusted to 75%, 55 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17590395702406565459", "cites_id": ["17590395702406565459"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071711002069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U06AhLGjHfQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 21, "2015": 12, "2016": 25, "2017": 14, "2018": 19, "2019": 31, "2020": 21, "2021": 20, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
