The stock of soil organic carbon (SOC) reflects the balance between carbon (C) inputs from plants, and losses through decomposition, leaching and erosion. Soil salinity decreases plant productivity and hence C inputs to the soil, but also microbial activity and therefore SOC decomposition rates. Using a modified Rothamsted Carbon model (RothC) with a newly introduced salinity decomposition rate modifier and a plant input modifier we estimate that, historically, world soils that are currently saline have lost an average of 3.47 t SOC ha\u2212 1 since they became saline. With the extent of saline soils predicted to increase in the future, our modelling suggests that world soils may lose 6.8 Pg SOC due to salinity by the year 2100. Our findings suggest that current models overestimate future global SOC stocks and underestimate net CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6526386040912334146", "cites_id": ["6526386040912334146"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969712010996", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qs2lo4ZhkloJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 8, "2019": 27, "2020": 29, "2021": 35, "2022": 28, "2023": 24}}
