To address this knowledge gap, we studied C-chemistry and microbial community structure during the decomposition of eucalypt, wheat and vetch residues with and without additional inorganic N. Bags containing ground residues of eucalypt, wheat, and vetch were buried in sand microcosms after inoculation with a diverse microbial community. Respiration was measured over an incubation period of 150 days. At different times during incubation, total C and N of the residues were analysed and residue carbon chemistry was determined by 13C-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy. Microbial communities were assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses.
