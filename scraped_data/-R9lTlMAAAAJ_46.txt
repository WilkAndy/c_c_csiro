Comparative estimates of organic C contained in living biomass (560 Pg) and atmospheric CO2-C (760 Pg) (Lal 2004a) indicate that variations in the size of the SOC store could significantly alter atmospheric CO2-C concentrations. A 5% shift in the amount of SOC stored in the 0\u20132 m soil profile has the potential to alter atmospheric CO2-C by up to 16%."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17392802900045209721", "cites_id": ["17392802900045209721"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-68027-7_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eSCUKRamX_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 14, "2014": 12, "2015": 11, "2016": 14, "2017": 22, "2018": 24, "2019": 15, "2020": 13, "2021": 11, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
