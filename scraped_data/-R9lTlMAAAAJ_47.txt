Computer simulation models constructed to predict the dynamics of soil OC have dealt with this diversity using a series of conceptual pools differentiated from one another by the magnitude of their respective decomposition rate constants. Research has now shown that the conceptual pools can be replaced by measureable fractions of soil OC separated on the basis of physical and chemical properties. In this study, an automated protocol for allocating soil OC to coarse (>50\u2009\u00b5m) and fine (\u226450\u2009\u00b5m) fractions was assessed. Automating the size fractionation process was shown to reduce operator dependence and variability between replicate analyses. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to quantify the content of biologically resistant poly-aryl carbon in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=310766454134734274", "cites_id": ["310766454134734274"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR12374", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wv3OinEQUAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 17, "2016": 24, "2017": 27, "2018": 15, "2019": 19, "2020": 17, "2021": 14, "2022": 22, "2023": 6}}
