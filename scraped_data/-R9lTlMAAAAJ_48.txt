The four adjacent sites were managed as Miscanthus sinensis grassland for several hundred years by the use of annual burning to prevent the regrowth of native forest species. At site I, annual burning was still being practiced when soil samples were collected; however, at sites II, III and IV annual burning to maintain grassland vegetation ceased about 20\u201330, 40\u201350 and more than 100 years ago, respectively, and the sites were left to return to forest. At site V, a mature, broad-leaf, deciduous forest established by natural regeneration existed.
