A net increase in pH following residue addition to soil is typically reported. However, effects are inconsistent in the field due to confounding soil processes and agronomic practises.A column experiment investigated the effects of canola, chickpea and wheat residues, differing in alkalinity content and C:N ratio, on soil pH changes in a Podosol (Podzol; initial pH 4.5) and Tenosol (Cambisol; initial pH 6.2) under field conditions.Residues (10 g dry matter kg-1 soil; 0\u201310 cm) increased soil pH, and temporal changes in alkalinity depended on the residue and soil type. Alkalinity was generated via abiotic association reactions between H+ and added organic matter and via ammonification and decarboxylation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15619314114576697492", "cites_id": ["15619314114576697492"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-012-1422-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lMiWum7zwtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 15, "2018": 11, "2019": 17, "2020": 25, "2021": 34, "2022": 22, "2023": 13}}
