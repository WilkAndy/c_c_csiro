Our data showed that there is an up to 8\u2030 13C-depletion in C4-derived chars from natural burning but there was no significant isotopic change in chars from wood or C3 grasses. We suggest that this 13C-depletion in C4-derived chars is due to protected organic matter in silicate structures (phytoliths), which were found to be depleted by up to 9\u2030. Analysis of this protected carbon by Py-GCMS indicated the presence of low relative amounts of n-alkanes. However, 13C-NMR data suggested that a significant portion of the phytolith-occluded material was composed of simple carbohydrates (O-alkyl carbon) and that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8368080013056356485", "cites_id": ["8368080013056356485"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638003001001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hTBFlm9kIXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 11, "2009": 5, "2010": 13, "2011": 10, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 7, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 14, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
