Water from Redwater Creek had a DOC concentration of 32 mg L\u22121, while water from Clearwater Creek had a DOC concentration of 3.8 mg L\u22121. Examination of the catchments revealed that while climate, topography, vegetation and land use were similar, the soils were different. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the concentration and chemical composition of DOC in stream waters and the nature of soils in the two catchments. Soil mapping determined that clayey soils formed on Cretaceous sediments (Cretaceous soils) occurred throughout both catchments, but that Redwater Catchment also contained a large area (39%) of sandy soils formed on Tertiary sediments (Tertiary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3214728257005987139", "cites_id": ["3214728257005987139"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00000573", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q6VAQFECnSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 6, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 7, "2001": 6, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 7, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 13, "2013": 10, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
