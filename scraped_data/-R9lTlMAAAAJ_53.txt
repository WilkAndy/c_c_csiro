Yet, no-till is still promoted as a management practice to stabilize the global climate system from additional change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, including the 4 per mille initiative promoted through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. We evaluated the body of literature surrounding this practice, and found that SOC storage can be higher under no-till management in some soil types and climatic conditions even with redistribution of SOC, and contribute to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. However, uncertainties tend to be large, which may make this approach less attractive as a contributor to stabilize the climate system compared to other options. Consequently, no-till may be better viewed as a method for reducing soil erosion, adapting to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:PflRiyi98mgC", "num_citations": 170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17774254412065012336", "cites_id": ["17774254412065012336"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47861-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cPqNOjfWqvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 25, "2021": 57, "2022": 59, "2023": 23}}
