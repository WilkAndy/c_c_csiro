The terms free and occluded were used to indicate density fractions in which organic materials weakly associated with soil mineral particles resided external to or within soil aggregates, respectively. The studied sites were under different vegetative covers and had different burning histories. Sites I and III were managed as grassland for several hundred years by the use of annual burning to prevent the regrowth of native forest. At site I, annual burning of Japanese pampa grass (Miscanthus sinensis) was still occurring. However at site III vegetation burning was stopped more than 100 years ago and the site was left to return to forest.
