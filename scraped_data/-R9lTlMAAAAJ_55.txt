Carbonate and silicate minerals were dissolved with HCl and a mixture of dilute HCl/HF, respectively. Demineralization kinetics were assessed for a range of freshwater and marine sediments, as well as pure mineral and organic samples. For samples with a very low organic carbon (OC) concentration (<1 wt.%) and samples containing a large fraction of acid-soluble OC, the organic molecules solubilized during the dissolution of the mineral fraction were recovered by freeze-drying the supernatants following (i) removal of dissolved calcium and residual HF by CaF2 precipitation, (ii) removal of the dissolved paramagnetic metals by sulfide precipitation, and (iii) desalting using ion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5784010118621345896", "cites_id": ["5784010118621345896"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146638001000183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aLiw0Y7uRFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 12, "2005": 11, "2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 10, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 10, "2012": 7, "2013": 16, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
