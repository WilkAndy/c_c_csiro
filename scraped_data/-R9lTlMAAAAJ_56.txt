With increasing discharge, dissolved organic carbon concentrations increased from 2.2 to 10.9 mg C L\u22121, \u039414C values increased from \u2212125 to +120\u2030, \u03b413C values decreased from \u221224 to \u221229\u2030, C:N ratios increased from 6.5 to 15.4, and specific UV adsorption increased from 1.4 to 3.8 L mg C\u22121 m\u22121. These changes in DOM composition are consistent with a shift in source from old and recalcitrant soil organic matter (OM) sources found in deep soil horizons to young and relatively fresh OM sources found \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 156, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11638726560299213218", "cites_id": ["11638726560299213218"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008WR006977", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ouGJWCQQhaEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 14, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 17, "2016": 21, "2017": 13, "2018": 13, "2019": 14, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
