However, little information is available on the relative effects of different clay minerals in the presence or absence of different hydrous oxides. We examined organic carbon stabilisation in an incubation experiment involving kaolinitic, illitic and smectitic clays with and without added goethite. The effect of adding hydrous iron (Fe) oxides (goethite, haematite, ferrihydrite) or imogolite to illitic clay only was studied in another experiment. Carbon (C) mineralisation, measured continuously over a 144-day incubation, was significantly influenced by clay mineralogy, with higher rates observed in the presence of the kaolinitic than the illitic or smectitic clays. The presence of goethite reduced C mineralisation in kaolinitic clay treatments but did not affect C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7435087191913348897", "cites_id": ["7435087191913348897"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706112000079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IT8NhGi8LmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 12, "2016": 12, "2017": 15, "2018": 12, "2019": 17, "2020": 18, "2021": 22, "2022": 19, "2023": 8}}
