However, the effects of interactions between hydrous iron oxides and phyllosilicate clays on the sorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are poorly understood. We carried out a batch experiment to examine the effects of goethite coatings on kaolinite, illite, and smectite on DOC sorption. The effect of coating illitic clay with different hydrous iron oxides (haematite, goethite, ferrihydrite) on DOC sorption was studied in another experiment. Organic matter extracted from dried medic (Medicago truncatula cv. Praggio) shoot residue was reacted with minerals at DOC concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 mg C L\u2212 1 at pH 6.0. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qmax) of phyllosilicate clays, as determined from fits to the Langmuir equation, increased in the order kaolinite < \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1637972793093834861", "cites_id": ["1637972793093834861"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706113001961", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bcgctJM_uxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 14, "2018": 18, "2019": 16, "2020": 18, "2021": 20, "2022": 27, "2023": 7}}
