In this paper, solid-state 13C NMR data pertaining to changes in the chemical composition of a diverse range of natural organic materials, including wood, peat, composts, forest litter layers, and organic materials in surface layers of mineral soils, were reviewed with the objective of deriving an index of the extent of decomposition of such organic materials based on changes in chemical composition. Chemical changes associated with the decomposition of wood varied considerably and were dependent on a strong interaction between the species of wood examined and the species composition of the microbial decomposer community, making the derivation of a single general index applicable to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 722, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=247376587660118983", "cites_id": ["247376587660118983"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/s97004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x8s6IbLbbgMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 9, "2001": 15, "2002": 15, "2003": 17, "2004": 25, "2005": 20, "2006": 21, "2007": 29, "2008": 28, "2009": 32, "2010": 33, "2011": 36, "2012": 26, "2013": 40, "2014": 35, "2015": 39, "2016": 35, "2017": 54, "2018": 35, "2019": 37, "2020": 37, "2021": 48, "2022": 35, "2023": 14}}
