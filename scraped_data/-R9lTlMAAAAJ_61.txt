Here, we present organic carbon (C) storage in VCE across Australian climate regions and estimate potential annual CO2 emission benefits of VCE conservation and restoration. Australia contributes 5\u201311% of the C stored in VCE globally (70\u2013185 Tg C in aboveground biomass, and 1,055\u20131,540 Tg C in the upper 1\u2009m of soils). Potential CO2 emissions from current VCE losses are estimated at 2.1\u20133.1 Tg CO2-e yr-1, increasing annual CO2 emissions from land use change in Australia by 12\u201321%. This assessment, the most comprehensive for any nation to-date, demonstrates the potential of conservation and restoration of VCE to underpin national policy development for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:R4LAE1HziJcC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11269322546478041935", "cites_id": ["11269322546478041935"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12176-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T8sfCiatZJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 28, "2021": 42, "2022": 43, "2023": 15}}
