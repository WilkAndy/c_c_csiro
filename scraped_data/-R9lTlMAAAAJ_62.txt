In response to the strong impact that agricultural management can have on the amount of organic carbon and nitrogen stored in soil and their rates of biological cycling, soils have the potential to reduce or enhance concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Concern also exists over the potential positive feedback that a changing climate may have on rates of greenhouse gas emission from soil. Climate projections for most of the agricultural regions of Australia suggest a warmer and drier future with greater extremes relative to current climate. Since emissions of greenhouse gases from soil derive from biological processes that are sensitive to soil temperature and water content, climate change may impact significantly on future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17274217063669104863", "cites_id": ["17274217063669104863"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/cp11170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3wD9jOVYuu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 6, "2016": 16, "2017": 19, "2018": 16, "2019": 6, "2020": 22, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
