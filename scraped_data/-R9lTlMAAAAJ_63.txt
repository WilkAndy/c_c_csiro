The aim of this study was to determine whether or not the easily dispersed colloidal materials differ in their properties from colloidal materials that do not disperse easily. Soil samples from the topsoil of sodic and non-sodic variants of an Alfisol under irrigated pasture (Kyabram, Victoria, Australia), and from the topsoil and subsoil of a sodic Alfisol under cultivation (Two Wells, South Australia) were fractionated into easily dispersed, moderately dispersed, and difficult to disperse clay, and silt, sand, and light fractions. As a proportion of total clay, easily dispersed clay content was greatest in the subsoil, and least in the Kyabram topsoils. In the topsoils, easily dispersed clay had larger particle size and lower cation exchange capacity than difficult to disperse clay, suggesting that high surface area and charge lead to increased inter-particle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10964268812675647809", "cites_id": ["10964268812675647809"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/s98076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QQlt2WToKJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 8, "2002": 7, "2003": 3, "2004": 11, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
