We compiled all available data on soil organic carbon (OC) storage in Australia\u2019s tidal marshes (323 cores). OC stocks in the surface 1\u2009m averaged 165.41 (SE 6.96) Mg OC ha\u22121 (range 14\u2013963 Mg OC ha\u22121). The mean OC accumulation rate was 0.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 Mg OC ha\u22121 yr\u22121. Geomorphology was the most important predictor of OC stocks, with fluvial sites having twice the stock of OC as seaward sites. Australia\u2019s 1.4 million hectares of tidal marshes contain an estimated 212 million tonnes of OC in the surface 1\u2009m, with a potential CO2-equivalent value of $USD7.19 billion. Annual sequestration is 0.75 Tg OC yr\u22121, with a CO2-equivalent value of $USD28.02 million per annum.
