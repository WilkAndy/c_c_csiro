The bacteria and fungi were collected, washed with deionized water, freeze dried and analysed using conventional and dipolar dephased solid state CP/MAS 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy. To obtain a quantitative estimate of the chemical composition of the bacterial and fungal carbon, a recycle delay of 3.0 s was required to allow complete relaxation between pulses, and the acquired signal intensities had to be corrected for the amount of signal relaxation which occurred during the contact time (i.e. T1pH effects). The bacterial materials contained more alkyl and carboxyl carbon but less O-alkyl and acetal carbon than the fungal materials. Comparison of the composition of the bacterial and fungal carbon with that of the native and residual substrate carbon contained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10630102651165556585", "cites_id": ["10630102651165556585"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9900213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aT-pYAq2hZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 5, "1992": 5, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
