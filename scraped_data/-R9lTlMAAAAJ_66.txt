Considerable recent attention has focused on predicting how biodiversity loss simultaneously impacts multiple ecosystem functions (that is, ecosystem multifunctionality), but the ways in which these effects vary across ecosystems remain unclear. Here, we report the results of two 19-year plant diversity manipulation experiments, each established across a strong environmental gradient. Although the effects of plant and associated fungal diversity loss on individual functions frequently differed among ecosystems, the consequences of biodiversity loss for multifunctionality were relatively invariant. However, the context-dependency of biodiversity effects also worked in opposing directions for different individual functions, meaning that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:VsjxJ5V0Y48C", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11951379817196283744", "cites_id": ["11951379817196283744"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0415-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YOfBY5_U26UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 17, "2020": 15, "2021": 29, "2022": 28, "2023": 27}}
