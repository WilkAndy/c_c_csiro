Four laboratory incubation experiments were conducted with three soils. To determine the influence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on respiration in saline and non-saline soils, a loamy sand (6.3% clay) was left unamended or amended with NaCl to obtain an electrical conductivity (EC) of 1.0 dS\u2009m\u22121 in a 1:5 soil/water extract. Powdered CaCO3 at rates of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5%, 5.0% and 10.0% (w/w) and 0.25-2 mm mature wheat residue at 0% and 2% (w/w) were then added. Cumulative CO2-C emission from the salt amended and unamended soils was not affected by CaCO3 addition. To investigate the effect of EC on microbial activity, soil respiration was measured after amending a sandy loam (18.8% clay) and a silt loam (22.5% clay \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14080362455794226562", "cites_id": ["14080362455794226562"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-010-0479-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gpVcdg1_Z8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 10, "2017": 5, "2018": 11, "2019": 18, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
