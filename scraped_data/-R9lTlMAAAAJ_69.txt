This study aimed to link species variation in RPE with plant traits and rhizosphere properties. Four C3 species (chickpea, Cicer arietinum; field pea, Pisum sativum; wheat, Triticum aestivum; and white lupin, Lupinus albus) differing in soil acidification and root exudation, were grown in a C4 soil. The CO2 released from soil was trapped using a newly developed NaOH\u2010trapping system. White lupin and wheat showed greater positive RPEs, in contrast to the negative RPE produced by chickpea. The greatest RPE of white lupin was in line with its capacity to release root exudates, whereas the negative RPE of chickpea was attributed to its great ability to acidify rhizosphere soil. The enhanced RPE of field pea at maturity might result from high nitrogen deposition and release of structural root carbon components following root \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:7iKzEIWBYlQC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9135665385401641107", "cites_id": ["9135665385401641107"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.13966", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k2iy40NnyH4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 20, "2020": 22, "2021": 20, "2022": 17, "2023": 14}}
