Wheat straw was added at rates of 0, 5 and 10 t ha-1 y-1, and gypsum and agricultural lime were added at rates of 3.4 and 2.0 t ha-1 y-1 respectively. Most of the measurements were taken on samples collected after three and four consecutive years of treatment applications, but some were taken one year after the fifth and final application of the treatments. The amount of water-stable macroaggregation in the top 10 cm increased with increasing rate of wheat straw application. Addition of agricultural lime incorporated with straw temporarily increased macroaggregate stability to a greater extent than was observed with either amendment alone.
