The purpose of this study was to assess the extent and rate at which bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) and continuous grain-corn (Zea mays L.) influence soil aggregation and various soil binding agents. Five cropping treatments ranging from 15\u2002yr of continuous grain-corn to 15\u2002yr of continuous bromegrass production were investigated. Soil aggregation and the nature of soil binding agents were determined by measuring the water-stable aggregate size distribution subsequent to the application of six chemical pretreatments \u2014 control, distilled water, 0.08\u2002M sodium azide, 0.08\u2002M sodium chloride, 0.08\u2002M sodium periodate, and 0.02\u2002M sodium pyrophosphate. A simple power function was used to describe the relationship between the cumulative percentage by weight of water-stable aggregates and aggregate diameter.
