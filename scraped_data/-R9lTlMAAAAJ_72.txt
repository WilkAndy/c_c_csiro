Although the capacity of soils to store SOC in a stable form is commonly attributed to the fine (clay + fine silt) fraction, the properties of the fine fraction that determine the SOC stabilization capacity are poorly known. The aim of this study was to develop an improved model to estimate the SOC stabilization capacity of Allophanic (Andisols) and non\u2010Allophanic topsoils (0\u201315 cm) and, as a case study, to apply the model to predict the sequestration potential of pastoral soils across New Zealand. A quantile (90th) regression model, based on the specific surface area and extractable aluminium (pyrophosphate) content of soils, provided the best prediction of the upper limit of fine fraction carbon (FFC) (i.e. the stabilization capacity), but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:GufwhD5tNfUC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9787460357713371057", "cites_id": ["9787460357713371057"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13720", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sR-50lYL1IcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 14, "2019": 14, "2020": 17, "2021": 32, "2022": 18, "2023": 14}}
