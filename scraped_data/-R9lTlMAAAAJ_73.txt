Three cropping treatments were considered: bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) grown continuously for 15\u2002yr (B15), grain-corn (Zea mays L.) grown continuously using conventional tillage for 15\u2002yr (C15), and grain-corn grown continuously for 13\u2002yr followed by 2\u2002yr of bromegrass (B13C2). Six water-stable aggregate size fractions ranging from 8.00\u20134.70 to 0.25\u20130.10\u2002mm in diameter were separated from the soil by wet sieving. The carbohydrate fraction was extracted by acid hydrolysis, reduced, acetylated to alditol acetates and analyzed by temperature-programmed capillary gas chromatography. Total carbohydrate content was not significantly influenced by cropping treatment but was observed to increase as aggregate size \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16527462501970251193", "cites_id": ["16527462501970251193"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.4141/cjss87-046", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uY2GTJRXXeUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 4, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 5, "1996": 2, "1997": 7, "1998": 11, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
