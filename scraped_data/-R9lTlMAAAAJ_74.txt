A fine sandy loam soil was incubated in the presence and absence of the labelled 13C-glucose for up to 34 days at 22\u00b0C and a soil water matric potential of -33 kPa. Carbon balance measurements indicated that no priming effect of glucose addition on decomposition of the native organic carbon occurred, and that 65% of the glucose 13C was mineralized during the incubation period. The ability of solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR to quantitatively detect all of the substrate 13C present in the samples was assessed by comparing the residual substrate 13C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8745516884020119862", "cites_id": ["8745516884020119862"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr9890725", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NkkzMUVRXnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 6, "1997": 8, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 7, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
