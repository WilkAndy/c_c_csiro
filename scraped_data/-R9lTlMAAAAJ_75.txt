In addition to defining the potential availability of SOC to decomposer organisms living in soils, the chemical structure of SOC also defines the strength with which mineral and organic soil components interact. The degree of physical protection of SOC is mainly a factor of soil texture, specific mineral surface area, and soil mineralogy. However, other soil parameters (eg water holding capacity, pH, porosity) can act as rate modifiers in attaining the protective capacity, set by the mineral matrix of the soil. Therefore, maximum protective capacity can only be achieved under \u201cideal\u201d conditions because other soil properties, together with the parameters established by the soil mineral matrix, affect whether carbon will accumulate in soil up to its maximum capacity. Thus, a realistic assessment of the degree of protection of SOC by soil minerals is possible only through a collective analysis of the individual physical, chemical, and textural properties of a soil. Bearing these limitations in mind, the aim of this paper was threefold:1 to review the 3 major controls of physical protection of SOC in soil (1. chemical nature of the soil mineral fraction, 2. physical nature of soil mineral fraction, and 3. architecture of soil matrix) 2 to examine the concept that soils have a maximum protective capacity, and3 to briefly evaluate the parameters used to account for the physical protection of SOC in several current soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:zAdBnjttzAIC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15468775680640549133", "cites_id": ["15468775680640549133"], "pub_url": "https://www.kirschbaum.id.au/NEE_Workshop_Proceedings.pdf#page=106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DQHIQoYhrNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 11, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 15, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
