As a consequence, the natural abundance of aged and degraded BC is unknown. We carried out a molecular characterisation of up to \u223c7000yr old charcoal and NaOH-extractable SOM obtained from a colluvial soil in NW Spain using Curie point pyrolysis-GC/MS and THM. Black C was tentatively quantified using solid state 13C CP and DP NMR in conjunction with a molecular mixing model (MMM), and the use of BPCAs. Not surprisingly, the charcoal consisted for the most part of chemically distinctive BC moieties, as concluded from CP and DP NMR\u2013MMM (>72% BC-inherent C) and the BPCA method (30\u201340%). Charcoal produced mainly benzene, toluene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) upon pyrolysis and THM. The SOM was a mixture of BC-derived \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11610238842973398665", "cites_id": ["11610238842973398665"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014663800800185X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iSbfyLbaH6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 10, "2011": 13, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
