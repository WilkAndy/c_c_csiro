Interactions between soil particles and microorganisms: Impact on the terrestrial ecosystem. Chichester (GB): Wiley & Sons", "pages": "85-131", "abstract": "The study investigates the effects of soil microbial activity and organic-mineral interactions on soil structural properties by studying the composition of the soil organic fraction as well as the concepts and descriptions of soil structure. In addition, the mechanisms accounting for soil structural form, structural resilience and structural stabilization (involving the entire soil organic fraction, plant roots, soil microorganisms, particulate organic matter, humus and dissolved organic matter) are discussed. The concept of aggregate hierarchy proposes that larger aggregates are composed of more stable smaller aggregates bound together by some mechanism of structural stabilization. In soils where organic matter provides the main binding agent, aggregation is dynamic because the organic agents responsible for the stabilization of structural form are not inert and are thus subject to decomposition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6813368082888211946", "cites_id": ["6813368082888211946"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023032511", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6j2JMCzyjV4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 8, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 2, "2010": 10, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
