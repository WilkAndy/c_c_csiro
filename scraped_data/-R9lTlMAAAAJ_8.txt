These factors are discussed within the framework of current soil organic matter models. The importance of soil structure in the stabilisation of organic residues through physical protection has been documented previously in various studies. In addition, changes in soil structure associated with tillage can significantly affect soil organic matter decomposition rates. The concept of physical protection has been incorporated into several soil carbon models as a function of soil texture. While soil texture can affect the soil's capacity for aggregation and adsorption, factors such as soil moisture and temperature may further enhance or reduce the extent of physical protection. While adsorption and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 643, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5890914340326518518", "cites_id": ["5890914340326518518"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp02085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9q5qkWG7wFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 6, "2005": 17, "2006": 22, "2007": 25, "2008": 30, "2009": 27, "2010": 36, "2011": 34, "2012": 35, "2013": 41, "2014": 39, "2015": 43, "2016": 36, "2017": 43, "2018": 38, "2019": 42, "2020": 41, "2021": 38, "2022": 35, "2023": 13}}
