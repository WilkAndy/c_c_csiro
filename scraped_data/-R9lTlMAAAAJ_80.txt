To better understand these mechanisms, we applied solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, along with elemental, stable carbon isotopic (\u03b413C) and lignin phenol analyses, to size and density fractions of sediments influenced by either mixed terrestrial and marine OC inputs (Washington Coast slope) or dominantly marine inputs (Mexican Margin). Elemental, isotopic and lignin analyses all reveal that within the Washington Coast sediment, the OC mixes linearly between nitrogen-poor and 13C-depleted, lignin-rich OC in the large and light fractions and nitrogen-rich and 13C-enriched, lignin-poor OC in the small and dense fractions, suggesting that this sediment contains a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10186636596517257433", "cites_id": ["10186636596517257433"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703705008513", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2cBnbwM0Xo0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 12, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
