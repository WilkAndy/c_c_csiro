Negative effects of these herbicides on symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legume crops and pastures have been demonstrated. Reductions in nitrogen fixation may result from a direct effect of the herbicide on rhizobial growth and/or an indirect effect on plant growth. In this study the influence of chlorsulfuron on the growth of chickpea rhizobia [Mesorhizobium ciceri (CC1192)], the growth of chickpea plants, and the extent of nodulation and nitrogen fixation by the chickpea/rhizobia symbiosis were examined. In vitro studies (in yeast mannitol broth and a defined medium) showed that chlorsulfuron applied at double the recommended field application rate did not influence the growth of chickpea rhizobia. An experiment using 14C-labelled chlorsulfuron was conducted to determine if rhizobial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4962378790938777219", "cites_id": ["4962378790938777219"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar03057", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g5bW8jfp3UQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
