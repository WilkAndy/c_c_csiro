The residual substrate carbon was concentrated in the clay and light fractions. Solid state CP/MAS 13C n.m.r. (cross polarization/magic angle spinning 13c nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical structure of the native soil organic carbon and the residual substrate carbon in the fractions of the control and treated soils. To obtain quantitative results it was essential to determine the spin lattice relaxation times in the rotating frame, T1pH, of the individual carbon types in the spectra as the relaxation behaviour of the native organic materials in the clay fraction was substantially different from that of the residual substrate carbon.
