It is generally believed that associative N2 fixation rates may be greater than free-living N2 fixation rates in ecosystems where grasses (including cereals) dominate, although this has not been unequivocally proven. Conditions promoting asymbiotic N2 fixation are reduced availability of oxygen, high temperature and soil water, and large amounts of microbially available C in the soil. The most direct measure of N2 fixation, incorporation of 15N2, has rarely been used in undisturbed systems, and we can find no examples of its field application in Australia.
