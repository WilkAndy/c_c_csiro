The variable contact time (VCT) experiment is shown to over-estimate T1\u03c1H, particularly for the charred samples, due to the presence of slowly cross-polarizing 13C nuclei. The variable spin (VSL) or delayed contact experiment is shown to overcome these problems; however, care is needed in the analysis to ensure rapidly relaxing components are not overlooked. T1\u03c1H is shown to be non-uniform for both charred and uncharred wood samples; a rapidly relaxing component (T1\u03c1H=0.46\u20131.07 ms) and a slowly relaxing component (T1\u03c1H=3.58\u20137.49) is detected in each sample. T1\u03c1H for each component generally decreases with heating temperature (degree of charring) and the proportion of rapidly relaxing component increases.
