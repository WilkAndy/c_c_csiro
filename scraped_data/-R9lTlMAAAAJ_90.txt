We combined field and simulation experiments to: (a) quantify the effect of subsoil chemical constraints on the lower limit of plant available water in sandy regolithic, hypocalcic, calcarosols, (b) assess the ability of current modelling approaches to account for the effects of chemically inhospitable soils on crop yield and water budget, and (c) investigate the interactions between subsoil constraints and rainfall. Lower limits were derived from measurements of soil water content using frequency domain reflectometry in an experiment combining three rotations, two locations, and three seasons (Experiment 1), and from gravimetric measurements in farmer-managed crops during three to four seasons (Experiment 2). A two-step method was used accounting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3227251170404173596", "cites_id": ["3227251170404173596"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429003000935", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HIfnPNd_ySwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 8, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
