By utilising carbon-13 enriched dissolved organic carbon (DOC) source materials in a repeated leaching-sorption-incubation study, we show here that the biochemical composition of mineral-retained organic matter (OM) is similar across four different classes of clay minerals but the quantity and stability of this OM is both a function of source material and clay mineralogy. Three to eight times as much carbon was retained on a mass basis when the same amount of DOC derived from eucalyptus versus wheat litter was applied, and the retained wheat-derived OM was up to 2.4 times more degradable than that of the eucalyptus source. For both litter types, carbon retention across the clay types was not significantly different; whereas, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:0ju6dEALV5wC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3956395495535711361", "cites_id": ["3956395495535711361"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-014-0009-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gZRcxr3w5zYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 13, "2020": 7, "2021": 15, "2022": 16, "2023": 7}}
