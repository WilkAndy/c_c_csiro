Here, we collected 352 cores from 18 sites across Moreton Bay, Australia. We assessed variation in sediment organic carbon (OC) stocks among different geomorphological settings (wetlands within riverine settings along with those with reduced riverine influence located on tide\u2010dominated sand islands), across elevation gradients, with distance from shore and among habitat and vegetation types. We used mid\u2010infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with analytical data and partial least squares regression to quantify the carbon content of ~2500 sediment samples and provide fine\u2010scale spatial coverage of sediment OC stocks to 150 cm depth. We found sites in river deltas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:wxMeWMEqLDMC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6510513049723900941", "cites_id": ["6510513049723900941"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13722", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DZRW4h_9WVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 15, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 14, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
