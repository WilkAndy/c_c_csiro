Given the large extent of salt-affected soils (19% of the 20.8 billion ha of arable land on Earth), this may lead to miss-estimation of CO2 release. Using soils from two salt-affected regions (one in Punjab, India and one in South Australia), an incubation study was carried out measuring CO2 release over 120 days. The soils varied both in salinity (measured as electrical conductivity (EC) and calculated as osmotic potential using EC and water content) and sodicity (measured as sodium adsorption ratio, SAR). For soils from both regions, the osmotic potential had a significant positive relationship with CO2\u2013C release, but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11874386825098135805", "cites_id": ["11874386825098135805"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es200515d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_YiNe-dLyqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
