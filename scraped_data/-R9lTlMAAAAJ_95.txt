However, environmental perturbations have been predicted to affect microbial-driven seagrass decomposition and subsequent carbon sequestration. Utilizing techniques including 16S-rDNA sequencing, solid-state NMR and microsensor profiling, we tested the hypothesis that elevated seawater temperatures and eutrophication enhance the microbial decomposition of seagrass leaf detritus and rhizome/root tissues. Nutrient additions had a negligible effect on seagrass decomposition, indicating an absence of nutrient limitation. Elevated temperatures caused a 19% higher biomass loss for aerobically decaying leaf detritus, coinciding with changes in bacterial community structure and enhanced lignocellulose degradation. Although, community shifts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:wTlTSBh5aqwC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=675457998944736088", "cites_id": ["675457998944736088"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/93/6/fix033/3071444", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WBPMp3i1XwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 16, "2021": 15, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
