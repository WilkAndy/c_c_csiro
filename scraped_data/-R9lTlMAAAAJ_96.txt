This study for the first time compared the short-term effect of various model organic compounds on pH change of two soils differing in initial pH (Podosol of pH 4.4 and Tenosol of pH 6.1). Eight organic compounds, representing common compounds in plant residues, were selected based on the number and type of chemical functional groups. The addition of organic acids (acetic, malic, citric, and benzoic acid) reduced soil pH immediately due to H+ dissociation. The magnitude of pH decrease depended on the rate of application, degree of dissociation of the acids, and initial soil pH. During a subsequent incubation, pH was slowly restored as these compounds were decomposed. The degree to which pH was restored was reduced with increasing addition rate. The production of H+ ions was increased with increasing rate of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "-R9lTlMAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10749257198723117611", "cites_id": ["10749257198723117611"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00374-010-0498-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K7IzYXgILZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 11, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
