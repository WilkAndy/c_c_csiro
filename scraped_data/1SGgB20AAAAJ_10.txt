Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 4665, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5340448582567072501", "cites_id": ["5340448582567072501"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-001-0045-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9RIm4bAVHUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 38, "2004": 42, "2005": 68, "2006": 82, "2007": 75, "2008": 87, "2009": 131, "2010": 163, "2011": 192, "2012": 231, "2013": 251, "2014": 286, "2015": 322, "2016": 317, "2017": 323, "2018": 370, "2019": 369, "2020": 379, "2021": 376, "2022": 349, "2023": 138}}
