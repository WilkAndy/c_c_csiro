The range in physiognomy and in floristic and faunal diversity is great. Faunal differences are largely explainable in terms of floristic composition and the effects of Man (ancient and modern), and because of this attention to animals in this overview is limited to their influence on the productivity and structure of the vegetation. The interactions of the two major growth forms and the mechanisms which underly the differences between savannas in this regard are the focus of this paper. Although the close interactions of form and function in ecology constitute a classic chicken and egg situation, it is possible to deal with the primary determinants of structure and then progressively account for differences in function and secondary structural differences."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6322194809074625904", "cites_id": ["6322194809074625904"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6322194809074625904&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cC22s67yvFcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 5, "1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 10, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
