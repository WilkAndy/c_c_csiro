Plant growth on these soils is stunted and plant cover is small. Distinct differences in species-composition (particularly of woody species) are evident from one site to another, although any one site has relatively little variation in vegetation. (2) Samples of soil and of vegetation were taken from forty-one relatively undisturbed stands of vegetation on sodic soils, distributed over about 60 000 km^2 mainly in the gneissic-granite regions of the country. The variation in soil and in vegetation, as well as their interrelations, were examined with principal components analysis and reciprocal averaging. (3) Plant root growth on these soils is limited to a relatively shallow surface layer by a highly sodic and largely impermeable B horizon.
