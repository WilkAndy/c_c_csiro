Developing pathways toward transformation is especially difficult in regions with multiple contested resource uses and rights, with diverse decision makers and rules, and where high uncertainty is generated by differences in stakeholders\u2019 values, understanding of climate change, and ways of adapting. Such a region is the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, from which we provide insights for developing a process to address these constraints. We present criteria for sequencing actions along adaptation pathways: feasibility of the action within the current decision context, its facilitation of other actions, its role in averting exceedance of a critical threshold, its robustness and resilience \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12173535380204528013", "cites_id": ["12173535380204528013"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26270401", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jaG9He4V8agJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 21, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
