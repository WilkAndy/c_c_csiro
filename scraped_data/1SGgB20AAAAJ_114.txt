Although they are, by definition, of low productivity, they have been a source of biotic, social, and scientific innovation. A third of the global biodiversity hotspots are in drylands, with a diversity of large mammals in savannas, high diversity and endemism of vascular plants in shrublands, and a high diversity of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals in deserts. Succulence, the CAM photosynthetic pathway, and camels\u2019 tolerance of changing blood water content are examples of biological innovations that arose in drylands. Drylands are culturally diverse and account for 24% of the world\u2019s languages (Safriel et al. 2005). Traditionally, many social groups moved both seasonally and in response to prolonged droughts (e.g., Davidson 2006).
