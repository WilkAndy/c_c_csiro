In 1991, 85 per cent of Australians lived in settlements with populations of 10 000 or more. The remaining 15 per cent of the population lived in small country towns, on farms or in remote settlements (see Table 3.1). Although Australia\u2019s largest settlements occupy less than one per cent of the nation\u2019s land area, they have a considerable influence on the natural environment of their hinterlands.This chapter examines the influence of demographic, economic, social and technological pressures on Australian settlements. The condition of our settlements is assessed with regard to livability, social amenity, health and resource inputs and waste outputs. The country\u2019s urban, rural and remote settlements are considered as three different kinds of interaction with the environment and various pressures, conditions and responses in these three types of settlement are examined. Finally, the chapter reviews government responses to identified problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:9djSGow2EaoC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3284501594745705268", "cites_id": ["3284501594745705268"], "pub_url": "http://st1.asflib.net/MEDIA/ASF-CD/ASF-M-00150/CHAP03.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NJMFY8zklC0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
