(2) Ten large herbivore species were present on the game section. The total animal biomass on the game section was approximately the same as that on the cattle section, where a few game animals were present. (3) Percentage utilization of herbaceous vegetation on the game section was 43% but only 28% on the cattle section. Twelve grass species were utilized more than 10% by cattle, as opposed to twenty species by game. (4) Up to 20% of the available browse (woody trees and shrubs) was utilized by game compared to 7-8% on the cattle section, where only a few game were present. (5) Grazing by cattle was less area-specific than that by game animals.
