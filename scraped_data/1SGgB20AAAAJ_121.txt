The main feedback effects are via exchanges of energy, water and momentum, and changes in biogeochemistry. All these processes are affected by ecosystem composition; to obtain a quantitative understanding of the interactions involved, it is necessary to describe vegetation in terms of its functional characteristics, based on a generally applicable classification of plant functional types (PFTs). Global-scale simulations of induced changes in ecosystem composition have progressed from non-dynamic, top-down models to mechanistic, ecophysiological models that predict PFTs and leaf-area index or biomass using plant responses to environmental conditions. Two such models are now being incorporated into general circulation models (GCMs), as first attempts at coupled atmosphere-biosphere models. Parallel developments include global-scale process models, which use fixed vegetation types to predict net primary production and nitrogen cycling, and a bottom-up modelling approach. The latter begins with detailed, mechanistic patch-scale models, extending to spatially variable versions involving landscape processes and gradually incorporating simplifying routines to allow for large data sets. The many implications of global change for agriculture are illustrated by two examples: cereal crop-effects; and pests and diseases. 39 refs, 3 figs"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3526378661416490950", "cites_id": ["3526378661416490950"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/7043253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xlc_gbU28DAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 8, "1996": 7, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
