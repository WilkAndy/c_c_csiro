The intention of this chapter is to present what the author thinks is now an accepted model, of the overall determination of savanna structure and function, and to then go on to discuss why it is still inadequate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12290823875943752338", "cites_id": ["12290823875943752338"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12290823875943752338&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kmKEEjLHkaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 6, "2000": 2, "2001": 6, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 8, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
