Frequency distribution of species was studied in 64 stands. Environmental data, collected in 40 of these, included weekly readings of water level, fortnightly readings of pH and total dissolved solids in water, and texture and organic matter content of topsoil and subsoil. An association table of 24 leading dominants, arranged so that strongly associated species were close together, corresponded closely to their observed order along a moisture gradient. Environmental scalars were constructed to combine data on pH and total dissolved solids, as well as initial water depth and rate of water loss. The soil data showed very little association with species distribution. Synthetic scalars for water regime and for water chemistry were plotted against one another to obtain an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3113363084596067483", "cites_id": ["3113363084596067483"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/b68-076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m7wp6jrjNCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 1, "1980": 1, "1981": 4, "1982": 1, "1983": 2, "1984": 3, "1985": 3, "1986": 0, "1987": 2, "1988": 4, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
