This study is an attempt to       adapt these techniques to an African large herbivore community. The aim was to descriptionbe quantitatively the habitat niche characteristics of the species comprising the large herbivore       community in Kyle National Park. Data were collected by means of systematic sampling of the whole study area, and comprised quantitative estimates of 28 habitat variables and other       descriptionptive information, recorded at each established species location. Following summarization and transformation of the data, a final matrix of 20 variables recorded for 14 species was       analysed by discriminant function analysis. Five discriminant functions were extracted, of which only the first three were ecologically interpretable.
