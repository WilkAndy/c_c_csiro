Channel development appears to be due to the confinement of rapid water movement by vegetation processes and peat formation in backswamp areas. The channels have sandy beds and densely vegetated banks composed of erosion\u2010resistant peat deposits between 1.5 m and 4 m thick. Sediment introduced into the delta is transported as bed\u2010load, is unable to escape from the peat\u2010lined channels and is therefore deposited along the channel floor. Channels that receive their water supply directly from source areas are therefore dominated by depositional processes. In contrast, channels that receive their water supply as overspill from these aggrading source channels do not receive bed\u2010load sediments from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12677786915934915552", "cites_id": ["12677786915934915552"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1993.tb00514.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4EtlvgeM8K8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 5, "2004": 7, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
