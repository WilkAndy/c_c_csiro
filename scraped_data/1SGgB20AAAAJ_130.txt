Four environmental gradients account for the bulk of variation in the vegetation in the vegetation. They are, in decreasing order of importance, disturbance (despite the fact that all stands chosen are relatively undisturbed), available nutrients, water regime, and salinity. The greatest variation in the data from these stands as a whole is in their salinity, but this is not reflected in the vegetation. The correlation between water regime and available nutrients is negative. A number of other factors show minor correlations with the vegetation and with each other. The method of application of principal components analysis used in this study was a valuable aid in the interpretation of the data.
