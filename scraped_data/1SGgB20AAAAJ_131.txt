It is not possible to be more precise, since the definition of semi-arid is itself imprecise. It is valid, though, to state that they cover no less than one-third of the region. Apart from edaphically determined, pure grasslands, and the virtually pure scrub of some induced semi-desert zones (such as the Karoo in South Africa) the vegetation is basically savanna in that it is a mixture of trees, shrubs and a herbaceous layer of grasses and non-graminoid forbs. The distribution of these savannas is discontinuous and is largely determined by rainfall. There is, in fact, no clear cut-off between savanna and other vegetation, since increasing rainfall leads towards a gradual increase in the development of woodland, which nevertheless still has an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14530500779713469659", "cites_id": ["14530500779713469659"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444417596500074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:25xbJ3m1pskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 0, "1985": 2, "1986": 3, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 7, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 6, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
