A cluster analysis was used to classify the vegetation, and the vegetation groups so derived were used to construct a vegetation map of Lake Chilwa. Principal components analysis was carried out on the species data to determine the relationships between species, and to ordinate the stands. By use of both these techniques, it appeared that a water depth gradient was the major controlling influence in the vegetation, although it was pointed out that this gradient was also correlated with salinity and disturbance. Soil pH and soil phosphorus accounted for less of the variation. Differences in soil texture did not seem to affect the vegetation, although chance appeared to play a very important role in determining the species composition of any stand. Most of the Lake Chilwa vegetation is made up \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4442099113959161755,2538896383790221736", "cites_id": ["4442099113959161755", "2538896383790221736"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2258958", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m_-c4JuBpT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 4, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
