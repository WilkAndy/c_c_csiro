The plots were maintained in their cleared states for three years, then monitored for the next five. In general, the sward was resilient to the disturbance except for the 90% selectively cleared treatment, in which a dominant, palatable species (Themeda triandra) failed to recover (though die most palatable species, Sorghum plumosum, did recover). The recovery patterns were dependent on post\u2010disturbance conditions, and markedly influenced by a particular rainy season and a fire during one of the dry seasons. In addition to species effects, the treatments induced changes in spatial patterning and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15905330081965555588", "cites_id": ["15905330081965555588"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1997.tb00651.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hD_kgnAVu9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 7, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
