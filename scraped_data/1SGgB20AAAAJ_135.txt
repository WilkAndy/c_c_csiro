This paper addresses the question of conservation in the optimal use of rangelands, where conservation is understood to mean maintenance of the system in a \u2018natural\u2019 state. We consider a rangeland that may exist in one of two states. In the \u2018natural\u2019 state, its dynamics are regulated by fire. In the \u2018managed\u2019 state, its dynamics are regulated by grazing pressure by livestock. We show that the optimal use of rangelands may include its maintenance in both states at different points in time, depending on initial conditions and the set of relative prices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11109825096639962551", "cites_id": ["11109825096639962551"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800904000989", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t93xIRAHLpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 10, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
