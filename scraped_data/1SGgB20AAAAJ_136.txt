It began with a vision; to reconnect Australians with the environment that surrounds them and supports their life choices. In essence to change the way people view the environment, not as a resource to be taken for granted but one to be valued for the free services it provides and one worth investing in. Whilst it was always an ambitious goal the project has made tremendous progress in promoting the concept and contributing to the science."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9260919432076439177", "cites_id": ["9260919432076439177"], "pub_url": "https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/12173", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ia5tMihlhYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
