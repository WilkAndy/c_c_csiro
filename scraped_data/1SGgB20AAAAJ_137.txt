It follows a previous study (Walker and others 1999) that explored the role of dominant and minor species in maintaining functional diversity and resilience in a rangeland ecosystem. Unlike our previous results, which were based on estimates of five plant functional attributes, the dominant species in this second community apparently are functionally no more dissimilar to each other than to all other species. We suggest that the lack of clear results in mixed life form communities represents a confounding of the relationships between the \u201chard\u201d attributes that actually govern how a plant performs in an ecosystem and the \u201csoft\u201d attributes that we use as surrogates. There are very few data on the hard functional attributes of plant species and consequently little information on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2792886364444591569", "cites_id": ["2792886364444591569"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-002-0154-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0YXA4llTwiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
