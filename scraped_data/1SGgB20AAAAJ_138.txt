Drawing on complex systems analysis, resilience thinking emphasizes that landscapes constantly change from social and ecological interactions, and focuses NRM planners\u2019 attention on identifying key variables, feedbacks, and thresholds that can help improve intervention strategies. More deliberative approaches are being developed to use resilience thinking in ways that engage and build human capacity for action. This article documents experiences shared with NRM agencies in rural Australia as we developed new approaches to link resilience thinking with collective learning principles. We present an emerging framework through which heuristics associated with resilience thinking is being used as part of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6332502870896493253", "cites_id": ["6332502870896493253"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08941920.2013.861556", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xULtXs-R4VcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
