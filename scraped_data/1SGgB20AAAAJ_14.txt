The traditional range succession model is associated with the management objective of achieving an quilfbrlum condition under an quilibrium graxing policy. In contrast, the state-and-transition model would describe rangelands by means of catalogues of alternative states and catalogues of possible transitions between states. Transitions often rquire a combination of clbnatlc clrcumstmces and management action (eg, fire, graxing, or removal of graxing) to bring them about. The cntalogue of transitions would describe these combinations as fully as possible. Circumstances which allow favorable transitions represent opportunities. Circumstances which threaten unfnvorable transitions represent haxards. Under the state-andtransition model, range management would not see itself as estal~ llshlng a permanent quilibrium. Rather, it would see itself as engaged in a continuing game, the object of which ls to seize opportunities and to evade huards, so far as possible. The emphasls would be on timing and flexibility rather than on establishing a fixed policy. Research under the state-and-transition model would aim to improve the catrlogues. Frquencfes of relevant clhnatlc circumstances would be estimated. Hypotheses about transitions would be tested experimentally. Often such experiments would need to be planned so that they could be implemented at short notice, at an unknown future time when the relevant circumstances ulse."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 2577, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15501865431722217030", "cites_id": ["15501865431722217030"], "pub_url": "http://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/jrm/article/download/8380/7992", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Rs61TXqwIdcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 10, "1991": 21, "1992": 26, "1993": 34, "1994": 41, "1995": 56, "1996": 56, "1997": 61, "1998": 74, "1999": 65, "2000": 66, "2001": 79, "2002": 62, "2003": 89, "2004": 95, "2005": 109, "2006": 94, "2007": 94, "2008": 101, "2009": 120, "2010": 126, "2011": 112, "2012": 109, "2013": 98, "2014": 99, "2015": 85, "2016": 94, "2017": 76, "2018": 73, "2019": 80, "2020": 81, "2021": 68, "2022": 57, "2023": 25}}
