(2) Total grass yield, and the growth of the three predominant species (Cymbopogon plurinodis (Stapf) Stapf ex Burtt Davy, Heteropogon contortus (L.) Roem. & Schult. and Themeda triandra Forssk.), were interpreted in relation to the availability of soil moisture in the growing season. Different growth strategies were inferred from patterns of shoot growth and of phenology. (3) It was concluded that the timing of rainfall within a growing season was important in that it conferred an advantage to one or other of these species which differed markedly in their temporal ability to respond to favourable conditions of soil moisture with shoot growth. (4) This phenomenon could account for observed differences in the proportions of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14426983287542881124", "cites_id": ["14426983287542881124"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2403898", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZJt90tzwNsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
