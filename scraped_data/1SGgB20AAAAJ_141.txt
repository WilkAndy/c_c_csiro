An attempt to determine age structure was prevented by confusing \u2018growth\u2019 rings. The two Acacia species and three of the dominants from the Burkea savanna show approximately stable age structures. Reduced numbers in some size classes, as a result of unknown past events indicate that the population of mature trees in the future will fluctuate, regardless of future conditions. Sclerocarya birrea has a markedly unstable structure, with no immature trees and no evidence of successful regeneration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15111162721684209494", "cites_id": ["15111162721684209494"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629916315022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vr8c2W6itdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
