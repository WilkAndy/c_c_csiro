A model of water dynamics (WATDYN) is developed for estimating plant available soil moisture (PAM) on particular sites. Potentially the model could be applied anywhere in the savanna regions of the world, using a minimum of readily available site data and standard weather records. It calculates water distribution in the soil profile and models water uptake using a modified Penman-Monteith equation involving separate calculations of soil evaporation and transpirational loss from each soil layer. Default data are provided where site data are unavailable. Vegetation is modelled only to account for radiation interception and for resistances to transpiration and evaporation. Growth is calculated on the basis of transpiration efficiency (adjusted for temperature, vapour pressure deficit, soil fertility and the time of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17419436743874730621", "cites_id": ["17419436743874730621"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304380095000240", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fVoKKm1FvvEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
