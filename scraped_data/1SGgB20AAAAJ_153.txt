Floating organic sudds, which form as a result of gas production in the benthic detrital aggregate, provide an exposed surface for plant colonization. The sequence of establishment of plants is determined largely by the input of propagules from the surrounding communities after exposure. These sudds are extremely mobile and, as a result of wind action, bank up on the leeward side of water bodies. Rates of encroachment across open water are variable and relatively slow (0.02\u20130.17 m year\u22121). A more rapid rate of encroachment (1.46 m year\u22121) is achieved in plant sudd formation by the vegetative growth of the sudd-forming sedge Pycreus nitidus (Lam.) J. Raynal. This species requires physical support for stolon extension which is provided by unconsolidated benthic detrital \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5324534555500493542", "cites_id": ["5324534555500493542"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030437709090027I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5jrmtveL5EkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
