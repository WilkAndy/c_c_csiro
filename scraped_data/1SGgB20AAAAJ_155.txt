It might be an entire swath of towns like the Rust Belt in the United States where industries are no longer competitive, or a vast area like the Aral Sea that has become a biological desert. These places have crossed a threshold into a regime in which the con trols (feedbacks) are different, and it won't be easy to return to the way things were.There is a much higher likelihood of crossing a threshold into a new regime if you are unaware of its existence.
