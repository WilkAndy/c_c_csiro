Each of these configurations produces a different set of ecosystem services, with differing consequences for different users. Changes in controlling slow variables can cause a system to shift from one regime to another if certain thresholds are exceeded and there is a change in dominant feedback processes in the social\u2013ecological system. Such shifts are often associated with large, rapid changes in ecosystem services, and can have substantial impacts on human societies. In other cases, feedbacks may trap a system in a regime that produces a very limited set of desired ecosystem services, and make it very difficult to shift the system to a different configuration. The importance of managing slow variables and feedbacks to maintain social\u2013ecological regimes that produce desired bundles of ecosystem services, restore social\u2013ecological systems to more desired configurations or transform systems to entirely new configurations is"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17765643606755098743", "cites_id": ["17765643606755098743"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=I_oGBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA105&dq=info:d8DT4rs-jPYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=DjzztDEcyo&sig=GrLxFdtuFDctiSJ2thsP_-UWpjc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d8DT4rs-jPYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
