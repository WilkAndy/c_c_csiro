They are based on the assumption that energy transferred during secondary impacts does not contribute to sampler penetration. This paper describes modifications made to a safety hammer to provide hammer\u2013anvil contact histories. Data collected demonstrate the occurrence of secondary impacts prior to the time at which the hammer and anvil were originally assumed to separate. These impacts can be predicted given only the dimensions of the hammer and rods. Secondary impacts are also observed after this time and the energy transferred is quantified. The data suggest that the total transferred energy is independent of rod length and that the secondary impacts occur early enough to contribute to sampler penetration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:SKbDCQBpHTkC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15878864305282836402", "cites_id": ["15878864305282836402"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2005)131:4(489)", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:smcDsfQOXdwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
