Water content showed a marked initial decrease in the newly flushed leaves but then remained almost constant for the rest of the growth period, spanning both the wet and dry seasons. In contrast to this, the osmotic pressures showed a characteristic pattern of change through the year. They were low in the newly flushed leaves, increased sharply as the leaves hardened and, following the onset of the rains, they decreased to a minimum about three-quarters of the way through the season. Finally they increased again between the end of the rains and the leaf fall, but did not exceed 20 atm.
