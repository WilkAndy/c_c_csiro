But what does that mean? The word is used differently in psychology, ecology, economics and engineering and runs the risk of becoming meaningless jargon. This would be most unfortunate because, if we are to successfully navigate very real and dangerous global trends, it is resilience that needs to be understood and fostered. Finding Resilience is international in scope and unravels how ecosystems, societies and people cope with disturbance and adversity. An authoritative but plain English account which is based on the experiences of researchers, the fascinating stories from around the world reveal what resilience is, how it works in different kinds of systems, how it is expressed, and how it can be gained and lost."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:Ol96Buz8XVoC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6187788318962473731", "cites_id": ["6187788318962473731"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9TeLDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:A9sRGbFw31UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=8MS56SDpYg&sig=_wHTI5KV3ltra182tnj61iBvnJk", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A9sRGbFw31UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
