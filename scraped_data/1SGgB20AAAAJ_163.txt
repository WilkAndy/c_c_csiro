In order to relate vegetation to climate there is an assumption, to a greater or lesser extent, of equilibrium between them. At a very coarse scale this is largely true. The Holdridge Classification is in effect a model of vegetation functional types (VFTs). The IIASA Biome I model (Prentice et al. 1992) is a PFT model based on dominant type only, and therefore effectively equates to a VFT model. At coarse, biome scales, therefore, the use of PFTs or VFTs is appropriate and useful (eg Woodward 1987). At patch and landscape scales, however, and especially in areas of high climatic variability, it poses a problem. In widely differing biomes (cf. Westoby et al. 1989 for savannas and Van Cleve & Viereck 1981 for boreal forest) species composition generally does not exhibit a tight correlation with mean climate. It varies over time and may exhibit more than one metastable state, and in each state the vegetation exhibits a wide range in both the kinds and the proportions of species. A change in state is mostly dictated by major episodic events, or combinations of particular conditions, and between these events the changes reflect fluctuations in response to variations in climate. The description by Austin & Williams (1988), of the changes in vegetation of what is now a forest area of New South Wales, Australia, known as the Pillaga Scrub, illustrates how one site can support a range of quite different vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16125231241257927520", "cites_id": ["16125231241257927520"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=0VPEmVSlePoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA91&dq=info:YMM1-GBUyN8J:scholar.google.com&ots=evyXktVddy&sig=mqfupIEPXk26ICFHsNis_ofdJNg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YMM1-GBUyN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
