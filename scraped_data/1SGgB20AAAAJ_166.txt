Turning the art into a much- needed predictive science requires including research in the management process. The key to the process is developing an appropriate model of how the wildlife system responds to management actions, applying the actions, monitoring the outcomes, and using this to improve the management model. Extrapolating management outcomes to different wildlife areas requires the development of theory, as illustrated by a range of examples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2615948093546471086", "cites_id": ["2615948093546471086"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/WR/WR97030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rp6yYu62TSQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
