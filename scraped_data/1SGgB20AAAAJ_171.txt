Resilience has since become a pervasive concept in risk management in financial, environmental and security policy, reflecting a consensus on the limits to prediction and the necessity of adaptation through crisis. Whilst \u2018resilience\u2019 can be directly traced to the ecologist Crawford Holling, its contemporary institutionalisation is explained by its resonance with Friedrich Hayek\u2019s mature neoliberal philosophy. The generalisation of complexity theory as strategy has ambivalent sources, reflecting its own trajectory from critique to a methodology of power."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:VxrznQoGMl0C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13019442053829925972", "cites_id": ["13019442053829925972"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315640051-19/resilience-jeremy-walker-melinda-cooper", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VJxQaJFZrrQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
