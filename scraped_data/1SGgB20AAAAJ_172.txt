Cellular immune responses are important in the early control of the virus. Evidence from animal models suggests that mutation in epitopes recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes may play an important role in the establishment of persistence but in human persistent infection, equivalent evidence is lacking. We investigated this by analysing a unique resource: viruses from a set of chronically HCV\u2010infected individuals in whom the CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in liver had previously been accurately mapped. Virus was sequenced in seven individuals at 10 epitopes restricted by 10 human leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Two main patterns emerged: in the majority of epitopes sequenced, no variation was seen. In three epitopes, mutations were identified which were compatible with immune escape as assessed using phylogenetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:PcID3NGdOhUC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16467704635045676237", "cites_id": ["16467704635045676237"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2893.2005.00676.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zYTzrR0KieQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
