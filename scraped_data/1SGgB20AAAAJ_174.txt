(2) The procedure presented in this paper develops an increasingly complex description of the ecosystem. The initial phase consists of a structural and dynamic description of the ecosystem, followed by a description of its utilization. From this phase, key questions are elaborated and, where appropriate, mathematical models are then constructed. (3) The South African Savanna Ecosystem Project (SASEP) provides an example of the manner in which the procedure can be applied. Examples of key ecological questions are cited, and appropriate models for some of these are described. (4) The use of the approach, in the SASEP, is described by reference to its current objectives, defined in terms of twelve key questions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14467456064731047779", "cites_id": ["14467456064731047779"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2402606", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y2fdlaO6xsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
