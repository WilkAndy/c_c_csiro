On sandy loam soils it is nine times faster through soil under litter than through a bare soil'surface, iii) Species composition varies markedly aocording to the proportions of perennial and annual grasses, the palatability of the perennials, and species diversity. Annual grasses increase interseasonal variation in production. Seasonal production is positively correlated with an increase in species diversity, iv) There is evidence that clearing woody vegetation can lead to increases of up to 400$ in grass growth, but this must be balanced against a number of benefits derived from the presence of trees.Five management principles are discussed, i) The ratio of grazingto browsing should approximate the ratio of grass to available browse, ii) Area selective grazingshould be overcome by five suggested means.^ iSri)^ Cattle should be managed using multipaddock, short duration grazing systems, iv) The use of fire, especially on lithosols, should be avoided, v) In National Parks and game reserves, animal numbers and fires should be controlled, but the introduction of artificial water supplies into characteristically dry areas should be avoided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:t-hv7AR41mYC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10824535416167387722", "cites_id": ["10824535416167387722"], "pub_url": "https://edepot.wur.nl/320441#page=126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:StJKM5x5OJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 3, "1986": 0, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
