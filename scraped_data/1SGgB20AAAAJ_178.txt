Oxford University Press, New York", "pages": "304-323", "abstract": "The diverse origins and aims of nature conservation give it secular appeal, though from the practical angle, its diversity and intangibility often become liabilities in the face of tangible economic interests. The deep inner peace we feel seated alone overlooking an empty sea or the sheer thrill that bubbles up uncontrollably inside us as we watch the restless energy of a million wildebeest criss-crossing the Serengeti plains is tangible enough to each of us. But such a deeply personal experience has little resale value in our matcrialisrie worlcI, unlikc-the-marlcet value of the once magnificent American prairie carved up into, thousands of monotonous squared-off com tielih and millions of dreary tract homes. The origins of conservation, whether spiro itual, economic, or recreational, lie buried in ancient cultures scattered around the world. The modem movement eneempasses the varied motives without always realizing our debt to our forebears' Or always doing justice to their motives. Hunting, religion, aesthetics, curiosity, adventure, recreation, entertainment, the rights of species, resource protection, science, education, economics, and many other reasons to save natural areas can be cited. Each new reason has added to, rather than replaced, others. From these small, localized beginnings, to. day's diverse global conservation movement is unified solely by a common interest in saving space and wildness."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14881813123787415685", "cites_id": ["14881813123787415685"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stuart-Pimm/publication/229068970_An_agenda_for_conservation_action/links/0912f50b5138f28f69000000/An-agenda-for-conservation-action.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hWAYWTDShs4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 4, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
