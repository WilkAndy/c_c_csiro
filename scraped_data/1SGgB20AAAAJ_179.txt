What is lacking is a cohesive framework for bringing these calls together. We propose that such transitions could be informed by lessons from three decades of scholarship on abrupt and surprising change in systems of humans and nature. Over time, many social-ecological systems exhibit cycles of change consisting of sequential patterns of growth, development, crisis, and reorganization. A critical phase in the cycle is the brief period after crisis when novelty and innovation can change the future trajectory. Without being prepared for this window of opportunity, deep, systemic change may be unachievable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:WEZ36b6n6v0C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1595528872580469766", "cites_id": ["1595528872580469766"], "pub_url": "http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol25/iss4/art23/ES-2020-12072.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BtQJXw51JBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 11, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
