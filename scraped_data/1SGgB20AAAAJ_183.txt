The objective of this book is to explore the potential of ecosystem experimentation as a tool to understanding and predicting more precisely the consequences of our changing biosphere. The papers in this book are the result of two SCOPE workshops to evaluated understanding of the response of ecosystems to large scale perturbations and to design ecosystem experiments to study the impace of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on ecosystem processes. The general topics addressed include the following: how changes in driving variables affect different biotic interactions within ecosystems; the human role in modifying forest structure and the resulting ecosystem processes; the role of ecosystem experiments in the study of controlling factors such as hydrological controls, temperature, and biotic controlles; analysis of ecosystem dynamics as a complex and chaotic system; role of ecosystem experiments in the study of the impact of acid deposition; role of ecosystem experimentation in the study of global change impace on the biosphere and the biospheric feedbacks to global environmental change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15650039146645311246", "cites_id": ["15650039146645311246"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6177052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Dk_AuK8bMNkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
