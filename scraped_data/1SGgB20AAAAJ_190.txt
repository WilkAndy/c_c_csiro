Within\u2010channel assemblages appeared to be related to the introduction of sediments from source areas and to differences in channel dimensions (particularly water depth) and current velocity. Channel margin assemblages appeared to be related to seasonal and longer\u2010term water level fluctuations, as well as the extent to which water, introduced from either the catchment or from local rainfall, contributed to the water budget. These two classifications have been combined in a functionally based classification of channels in the study area in which five channel types were recognized; long\u2010term and short\u2010term aggradational, primary filter and confined and unconfined outlet channels.
