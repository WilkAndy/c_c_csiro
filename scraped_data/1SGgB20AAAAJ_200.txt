Although it is rarely possible to attribute the process measurements to other than a broad group of organisms, a general link can be made to the key ecosystem functions performed by the soil biota: organic matter decomposition nutrient transformation and translocation\u2610 greenhouse gas formation and breakdown pedogenesis and soil morphology Whilst performed by the soil biota, many of these processes can be measured directly without study of the organisms responsible. However, understanding of the factors controlling these processes is therefore partial. The only major function that is dependent on the direct investigation of the organisms is the maintenance of food webs (and related energy transformation). Whether in the study of major ecosystem processes or food webs, research on soil biota suffers three major technical limitations:(1) taxonomic problems, particularly with bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi, but also with the wide range of fauna from protozoa through to mammals and including many temporary immature stages of insects;(2) an opaque medium which inhibits direct observation, even under experimental conditions; and (3) the specialized methods, some of which are grossly inefficient, that are required for isolation, extraction and quantification of the biota, with different methods required for different groups of organisms. In examining the state of knowledge on soil biodiversity and ecosystem function we explore sequentially and briefly the following questions: How diverse is the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:g2zAJ5Cw7N4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16310484687668380113", "cites_id": ["16310484687668380113"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oWgKuI5Du78C&oi=fnd&pg=PA385&dq=info:0QHsImh7WuIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=JPCcz_0yVi&sig=a0s9ABdgfZMffFlPrWRPkExH_98", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0QHsImh7WuIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
