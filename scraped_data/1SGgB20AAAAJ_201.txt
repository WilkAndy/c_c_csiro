As the authors point out, policy makers need a better understanding of the concept of resilience. Furthermore, it is especially important for them to understand the crucial elements for maintaining resilience in the integrated ecological-socioeconomic resource use systems (the forests, rangelands, and agro-ecosystems) on which most human welfare depends."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1783362076577239743", "cites_id": ["1783362076577239743"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environment-and-development-economics/article/resilience-instability-and-disturbance-in-ecosystem-dynamics/B6B6C785BC92A5F03DAFA08396C2739B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vxJKKFzGvxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
