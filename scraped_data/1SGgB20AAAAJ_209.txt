It is proposed that in a number of these regions, both overall economic development and the welfare of the inhabitants would improve if the primary form of land use was based on multiple use of those regions' natural biological resources, rather than continuing the practice of replacing or displacing them with marginal forms of agriculture. Testing this proposition, and then (if appropriate) effecting it, requires answers to a number of ecological, economic and management questions, in particular to do with:     identifying those regions where biodiversity use has high potential     the appropriate spatial scales for planning and management     compatible combinations of different types of resource use     ecological and economic trade-offs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6794898678515057941", "cites_id": ["6794898678515057941"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environment-and-development-economics/article/maximising-net-benefits-through-biodiversity-as-a-primary-land-use/6A8401531122C2279C259F9FA0FCE175", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FUWp4VhUTF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
