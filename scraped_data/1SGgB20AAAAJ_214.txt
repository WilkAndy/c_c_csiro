It seemed possible that the drug would also be effective in patients who had been adrenalectomised for the disease. The effect of 5.0 mg of bromocriptine on plasma ACTH and prolactin levels in 13 patients, bilaterally adrenalectomised for pituitary-dependent Cushing\u2019s syndrome, was therefore studied. In only one patient was a fall in plasma ACTH observed. This may be of doubtful significance since marked spontaneous fluctuation in plasma ACTH levels were found in the five patients tested. Bromocriptine lowered the plasma prolactin in all of the. patients, including two with hyperprolactinaemia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ZbQVaL1IMbQC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=815090751048916272", "cites_id": ["815090751048916272"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03350982", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MB36M7jITwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
