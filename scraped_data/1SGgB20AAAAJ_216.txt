We sought to provide and apply a framework that could address this concern by indicating the extent to which various na-tions are avoiding endangering future well-being. In the spirit of the Brundtland Commission (World Commission 1987), we took the view that sustainable development requires sustained well-being. Our index of well-being is intertemporal-the present value of utility or satisfaction from the current time to the indefinite future. Central to our analysis is the connection between sustainability and the potential for production. Maintaining well-being requires each generation to bequeath to its successor at least as large a productive base, relative to its \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14660561376233793286", "cites_id": ["14660561376233793286"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/4620962", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Bic6juXGdMsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
