The degree of development of a shoot, relative to others in the canopy, is governed by branch and position in the canopy. At least six phenological phases were identified in the annual growth cycle.The pattern of growth and the phenological cycle are not changed by water stress. Initiation, emergence and development of shoots and leaves are governed by how favourable environmental conditions are. If there is little shoot growth early in the season, these plants can partially compensate by producing more leaf per unit of shoot if environmental conditions improve.Leaf and shoot growth at the beginning of the season took place only if there was sufficient moisture available, and if the minimum temperature had risen above \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13264536059064612757", "cites_id": ["13264536059064612757"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02566702.1988.9648116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lffnZkQZFbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
