Why do the majority of species occur in low abundance, with just a few making up the bulk of the biomass? We propose that many of the minor species are analogues of the dominants in terms of the ecosystem functions they perform, but differ in terms of their capabilities to respond to environmental stresses and disturbance. They thereby confer resilience on the community with respect to ecosystem function. Under changing conditions, ecosystem function is maintained when dominants decline or are lost because functionally equivalent minor species are able to substitute for them. We have tested this hypothesis with respect to ecosystem functions relating to global change. In particular, we identified five plant functional attributes\u2014height, biomass, specific leaf area, longevity, and leaf litter quality\u2014that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 1290, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18048424805654856976", "cites_id": ["18048424805654856976"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s100219900062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EAVocLziePoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 12, "2001": 23, "2002": 29, "2003": 36, "2004": 31, "2005": 43, "2006": 42, "2007": 48, "2008": 43, "2009": 57, "2010": 59, "2011": 73, "2012": 63, "2013": 96, "2014": 87, "2015": 68, "2016": 92, "2017": 86, "2018": 67, "2019": 54, "2020": 53, "2021": 53, "2022": 47, "2023": 18}}
