Fires set by Aboriginal people or lightning were relatively frequent in many ecosystems. These systems were also adapted to highly variable rainfall in both time and space (Friedel et al., 1990). Following the establishment of water points after European settlement, wild (native and feral) and commercial animals combined to exert high grazing pressure on rangeland vegetation. This increased pressure has reduced grass cover, and thus the build up of fuel. This, in turn, has reduced the frequency of fire in many rangeland systems. Sheep and cattle are primarily grazers, rather than browsers, so they do not suppress shrubs. These changes have combined to cause woody plants to increase (Noble, 1997), and grass production per unit of rainfall to fall. Rangeland managers must decide when to reduce grazing pressure in order to let the system recover, and if and when to use fire to suppress shrubs. The manager is confronted with many uncertainties: rainfall patterns, prices, imperfect knowledge of the ecological systems, and possible change in regulations. An important property of an ecological system such as a rangeland is the possibility that the system may occupy one of multiple states (Walker et al., 1981). Depending on the management of the system, the rangeland can flip from a productive and sustainable state to an unproductive state. Ideally rangeland managers maintain the resilience of the system, that is, they will minimize the probability that the system flips to another (less productive) state due to a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3318305057926217665", "cites_id": ["3318305057926217665"], "pub_url": "https://marcojanssen.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2002_Implications_of_spatial_heterogeneity_of_grazing_pressue_on_the_resilience_of_rangelands.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wf8Set78DC4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3}}
