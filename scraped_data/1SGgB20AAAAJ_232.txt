At the same time there seems to be increasing regulation and complexity of administration, declining optimism among the public, and other processes that suggest that the ability of communities and nations to cope with change is reaching critically low levels.How might we explore a nation's ability to deal with change, especially potential future shocks? We all interpret our world through different eyes, based on different experiences and different frameworks or\" mental models\" that help us make sense of the complexity we see. This leads societies to propose a diversity of actions and philosophies to address perceived present and future needs. Various approaches have been developed to help humans understand how their worldviews and actions interact with ecological resources and processes to become the complex dynamic social-ecological systems that we are all part of. Different approaches provide different perspectives and appeal to different decision makers. One framework that has emerged as interdisciplinary teams of scientists have learned from past environmental and social failures is the concept of\" resilience\". 4 This paper explores how a well-developed approach to thinking about resilience of social-ecological systems might be used to ask how well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6277216099161739089", "cites_id": ["6277216099161739089"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ross-Buckley/publication/260081128_How_Resilient_is_Australia/links/5897b29f92851c8bb67f0827/How-Resilient-is-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UQ_muMgmHVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
