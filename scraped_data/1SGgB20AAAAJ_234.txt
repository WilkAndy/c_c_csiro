Lack of available phosphorus, potassium and calcium, extremely alkaline conditions and surface crusting were shown to be the principal limitations to plant establishment. In a series of pot plant experiments the application of soil, substantial quantities of gypsum to reduce the pH, and various concentrations of compound and other fertilizers resulted in successful growth of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., C. aethiopicus Clayton and Harlan and Sporobolus spicatus (Vahl) Kunth. The last species showed most potential as a pioneer sward plant due to its rapid stolon production and little dependence upon fertilizers for successful growth."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12829568414975492344", "cites_id": ["12829568414975492344"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629916315502", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-IAv3H_IC7IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
