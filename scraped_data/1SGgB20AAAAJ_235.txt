The plant shows extremely specific establishment requirements and seedlings can only survive in those areas which have fine-textured soils and a high density of shade trees. Selection of these sites appears to be related to available moisture in the soil. In fine-textured subcanopy sites moisture is retained in the first few centimetres of the soil for longer than in more sandy or exposed conditions. Even within the above sites seedling input was extremely variable, further stressing the importance of establishment. It is suggested that the removal of shade trees might be worth testing as an effective and less costly control measure in the long term rather than removing the cactus itself."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:EHjGVGKDnHoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12268074342202303152", "cites_id": ["12268074342202303152"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022461816300080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sGINfZ30QKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
