The oribi exhibited a preference for particular plant       communities as well as species. This selection was influenced by the availability of burnt areas. The low crude density of oribi may be increased by the provision of food with a high nutrient       content during the winter months. This may be achieved by ensuring that some of the least utilized grassland community is burnt every year.
