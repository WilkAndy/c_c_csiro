TNCs have rarely been linked to ecosystem dynamics, and even less so considered suitable partners for knowledge co-production in sustainability research. How TNCs shape the intertwined nature of people and planet therefore represents a timely and critical topic and the Correspondence articles by Schneider et al. and Etzion offer some important forwardlooking research questions. The Correspondence by Schneider et al. focuses on important tensions in corporate sustainability, several of which are addressed in the literature cited in our Perspective. The authors emphasize the past record of specific types of TNCs in generating unsustainability and driving undesirable social outcomes and inequality to, in effect, oppose the proposition that TNCs could become active agents of systemic change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:0XvJNYv_SW4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=968133114175319712", "cites_id": ["968133114175319712"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1145-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oG62HfB_bw0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
