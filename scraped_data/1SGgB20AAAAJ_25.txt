Recent developments identify three strategies that make optimal use of current understanding in an environment of inevitable uncertainty and abrupt change: reducing the magnitude of, and exposure and sensitivity to, known stresses; focusing on proactive policies that shape change; and avoiding or escaping unsustainable social\u2013ecological traps. As we discuss here, all social\u2013ecological systems are vulnerable to recent and projected changes but have sources of adaptive capacity and resilience that can sustain ecosystem services and human well-being through active ecosystem stewardship."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 1102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10817680807375406369", "cites_id": ["10817680807375406369"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(09)00325-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IQUsOWEfIJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 20, "2011": 50, "2012": 67, "2013": 82, "2014": 102, "2015": 116, "2016": 100, "2017": 104, "2018": 84, "2019": 89, "2020": 107, "2021": 72, "2022": 61, "2023": 34}}
