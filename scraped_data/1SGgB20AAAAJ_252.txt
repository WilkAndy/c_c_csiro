Previous studies show, that in Queensland, about 50-60% of native pastures are in good condition; 30% require low key management inputs to improve them and the remainder will need a major capital outlay to restore them. Research inputs into native pastures fall well below those required. In addition to current work described at this Conference, an assessment of the present condition and health of the grazing lands, together with an ongoing program to monitor trends, particularly in high risk areas, is urgently needed. Management packages directed at specific needs for local areas are required, An optimistic scenario for development of introduced pasture over the next decade is that sown and naturalized pastures will increase from the present 9.8 to 13.4 m ha. Areas of fodder crops will increase from 500 000 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10239333737846256650", "cites_id": ["10239333737846256650"], "pub_url": "https://www.tropicalgrasslands.info/public/journals/4/Historic/Tropical%20Grasslands%20Journal%20archive/PDFs/Vol_25_1991/Vol_25_02_91_pp219_223.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CrT_xMhrGY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
