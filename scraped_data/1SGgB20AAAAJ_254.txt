In most instances the unacceptable change will apply not to the abundant mammal itself, but to some associated species, such as a competitor or one of its favored food species (ie, one of Caughley's [this volume] Class 2 reasons for culling). In other cases, however, the de\u2014cision may be to allow any change short of complete extinction of the mammal itself.As a result of these two views there has developed a di\u2014chotomy into the two extremes of strict controlled culling to keep things constant, and laissez faire. The dichotomy is, however, unnecessary, since there are various degrees of con\u2014trol. The essence of the argument which follows is that it is necessary to try to determine the limits of change in each of the key variables of the system, beyond which irreversible and unacceptable changes occur, and then to allow all changes up to these limits to take place."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7310533820214187025", "cites_id": ["7310533820214187025"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=gJE6JTNHd_UC&oi=fnd&pg=PA57&dq=info:EZRY0MY7dGUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=4iT4gHDF0B&sig=pGtTatTNwxbP1pZEvk0BzEWK7M4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EZRY0MY7dGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
