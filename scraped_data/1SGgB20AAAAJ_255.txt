It is suggested that management should be directed towards livestock production from natural vegetation, and management objectives are presented (maintenance of opt. stocking rates, even distribution of watering points, grazing control by fencing, fire control, bush clearing, opt. herbivore composition, sound animal husbandry and opt. utilization of animals)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9745387310084939588", "cites_id": ["9745387310084939588"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19800714742", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RF82ECCSPocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
