As the human population grows, the variety of life declines, ice caps shrink, and our Earth system behaves in ways its species have never experienced. The past no longer provides us with a guide to how the future will behave, and we search for solutions while moving into an increasingly uncertain space. In such a time, resilience science provides important insights to help communities engage with the complex set of challenges they need to navigate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:sgVRHlApM4oC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11321752410304482149", "cites_id": ["11321752410304482149"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.5822/978-1-61091-861-9_10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZQsf-9TxHp0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
