The immune systems we see today have stood the test of time. They are clearly successful systems for dealing with invasions of dangerous and unwanted microorganisms. Janssen (2001) offers an interpretation of the basic elements of an immune system. He also explores the use of this structure to develop an understanding of how to deal with invasive organisms in ecosystems and, more generally, how to design institutions that will promote long-term sustainability. He extends the notion of invasions beyond the usual one of nonhuman species to include other humans, technological innovations, and even cultural invasions (religions and Big Macs), but then restricts the inquiry to ecosystem management, focusing on the institutions that give rise to successful \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3865261315444998978", "cites_id": ["3865261315444998978"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271789", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QoMo968qpDUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
