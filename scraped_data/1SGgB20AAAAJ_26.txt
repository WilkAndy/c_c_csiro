A model is developed which accounts for the growth of woody vegetation and of grasses, and analyses the competition between them for available soil water. (2) The model is based on Walter's two layer hypothesis. Woody vegetation and grasses compete for water in the surface layers of the soil, but woody vegetation has exclusive access to a source of water relatively deep underground. Where there is only a small biomass of grass the soil surface tends to become impermeable and, in these conditions, the model shows that two different steady states may develop: with a lot of woody vegetation alone, or with a relatively large biomass of grass and rather little woody vegetation. (3) The results are discussed in terms of the concept of resilience. The continued existence of both stable states under ranching \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 1052, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15675833928117024237", "cites_id": ["15675833928117024237"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2259679", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7XVuS-e_i9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 8, "1985": 7, "1986": 13, "1987": 10, "1988": 8, "1989": 17, "1990": 12, "1991": 11, "1992": 13, "1993": 15, "1994": 18, "1995": 24, "1996": 19, "1997": 23, "1998": 23, "1999": 22, "2000": 27, "2001": 23, "2002": 25, "2003": 22, "2004": 27, "2005": 27, "2006": 47, "2007": 37, "2008": 37, "2009": 48, "2010": 43, "2011": 32, "2012": 43, "2013": 46, "2014": 48, "2015": 33, "2016": 35, "2017": 36, "2018": 28, "2019": 31, "2020": 24, "2021": 30, "2022": 28, "2023": 8}}
