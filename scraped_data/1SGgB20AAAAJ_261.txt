This has led to community concern for the gradual irrecoverable loss of values associated with less intensive land uses; in particular, concern for the availability and functional capacity of biodiversity, earth materials, water and air. Concern extends to the functionality of these resources in industrial, amenity and service roles.Such losses, called, inter alia, environmental costs, are never wholly avoidable despite the hopes behind the sustainable development concept. What is realistically possible is conservative development, meaning that land uses with environmental costs exceeding the economic net benefits would be proscribed as options, through the application of extant and emerging social technologies such as land use zoning, environmental standards and environmental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=817540179609980639", "cites_id": ["817540179609980639"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ldr.3400050209", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3w5DO3Z8WAsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
