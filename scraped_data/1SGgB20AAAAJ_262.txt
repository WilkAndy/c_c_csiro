In terms of direct feedback influence on climate their effects are via opaqueness of the atmosphere (dust and aerosols) and the albedo of the surface. Change in these regions is brought about by the separate and (especially) interactive effects of climate, fire and herbivory. Likely changes in productivity, vegetation structure and soil erosion will lead to some changes in stored carbon and feedback effects. Possible increased cultivation of marginal areas is an important unknown. Management options include livestock numbers, type and distribution, fire regimes, woody vegetation clearing, subsistence cropping and rehabilitation measures.
