The mapped form of each land characteristic is stored in a data base system for subsequent use and overlay by a grid of selected cell size. Existing information is used to derive a capability value for each land characteristic, whose influence upon the overall capability is included by user-defined weighting values. The overall capability of each grid cell. is the weighted mean of the individual capability values of each land characteristic analysed. A foreclosure of options in land use is also performed. A trial run of the procedure illustrated the influence of the selected grid cell size and the weighting value. The value of a versatile capability analysis tool, able to analyse any defined land use for an area of unrestricted size \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6856246818816670245", "cites_id": ["6856246818816670245"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030439248490025X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JTr43ydIJl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
