We conducted a horizon scan to identify and prioritise key challenges facing Australian rangelands and their communities, and outline possible avenues to address these challenges, with a particular focus on research priorities. We surveyed participants of the Australian Rangeland Society 20th Biennial Conference, held in Canberra in September 2019, before the conference and in interactive workshops during the conference, in order to identify key challenges, potential solutions, and research priorities. The feedback was broadly grouped into six themes associated with supporting local communities, managing natural capital, climate variability and change, traditional knowledge, governance, and research and development. Each theme had several sub \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:LVc8VEQ2EB0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4149031662735050989", "cites_id": ["4149031662735050989"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/rj/rj20059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7cgrk1BSlDkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
