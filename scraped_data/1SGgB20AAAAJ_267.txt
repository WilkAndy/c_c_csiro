Legume-yield decline is a major problem in 200,000 ha of siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum [DC] Urb.)-based pastures in northern Australia. This decline is largely associated with overgrazing. Resting for at least one year has been required to improve siratro yield substantially. A more rapid method of restoring the yield of siratro was required. The effect of various forms of mechanical soil disturbance on siratro population and yields was compared with resting pasture (control) in 4 replicated experiments and on 3 commercial pastures near Mackay in coastal northeastern Australia. The renovation treatments were cultivation with tines, deep ripper, disk harrow, disk plough, and rotary hoe, with a control treatment of no cultivation at all sites. Three of the experiments contained an oversowing treatment of 2 kg/ha \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:PkDzUJVvfTUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10983312185421540668", "cites_id": ["10983312185421540668"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429303142-189/renovation-tropical-legume-grass-pastures-northern-australia-bishop-walker-rutherford", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PC1FlT2QbJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
