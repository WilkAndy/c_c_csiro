The field now has significant knowledge of sustainability issues that are firm and industry focused. However, complex ecological problems are increasing, not decreasing. In this paper, we argue that it is time for corporate sustainability scholars to reconsider the ecological and systemic foundations for sustainability, and to integrate our work more closely with the natural sciences. To address this, our paper introduces a new development in the natural sciences \u2013 the delineation of nine \u2018Planetary Boundaries\u2019 which govern life as we know it. We call for more systemic research that measures the impact of companies on boundary processes that are at, or possibly beyond, three threshold points \u2013 climate change, the global nitrogen cycle, and rate of biodiversity loss \u2013 and closing in on others. We also discuss practical implications of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 901, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16429735621132871709", "cites_id": ["16429735621132871709"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01073.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Heg0u38lAuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 10, "2014": 28, "2015": 39, "2016": 69, "2017": 94, "2018": 108, "2019": 107, "2020": 111, "2021": 129, "2022": 124, "2023": 57}}
