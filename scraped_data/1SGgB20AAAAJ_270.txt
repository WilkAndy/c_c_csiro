Recent findings from comparative studies of regionalscale social\u2013ecological systems indicate that systems like \u2018wild rangelands\u2019 can have a number of alternate pairs of stability regimes (configurations of states) at different scales, each pair separated by a defined threshold. Loss of resilience in a desired regime leads to a \u2018flip\u2019into an alternate, usually undesired, regime, from which it is either difficult or impossible to recover. The thresholds between regimes are marked by changes in feedbacks in the system. The interactions amongst the thresholds strongly determine the future trajectory of the system as a whole."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13606481267042820840", "cites_id": ["13606481267042820840"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781444317091#page=35", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6CIYRZ_u07wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
