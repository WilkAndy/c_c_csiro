It is destructive, especially in conditions of reduced fallow periods when available land runs short. It is also a subsistence agriculture, which will never lead to economic development. This agriculture is thus less and less appealing to young people who have higher levels of education and more need to consume than their parents and grandparents. I know of some countries where these people prefer to live in towns rather than carry out this kind of agriculture. If high-or intermediate-level tech-nologies are not developed, the only alternative is shifting cultivation, which has largely demonstrated its limitations. Refusing technology im-plies the choice of something even more destructive and with no economic future. Is that what Fearnside recommends? High-input technolo-gies for oil palm, rubber, or sugar cane production are already being \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2411961558652900665", "cites_id": ["2411961558652900665"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1310703", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OVVnK0ICeSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
