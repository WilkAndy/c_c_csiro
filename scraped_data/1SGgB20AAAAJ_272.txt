The outstanding accessions for dry matter yield were S. scabra 40292 and 40205: they significantly out-yielded S. hamata cv. Verano at all three sites and their plant densities in the third year at the wettest site were significantly higher than all other accessions except S. scabra 49833. At all sites, 'Verano' gave significantly higher mean annual dry matter yields than S. guyanensis cv. Oxley and S. humilis cv. Paterson. Other accessions that showed promise were S. scabra 49833 and 40289 and S. viscosa 34904: the latter accession performed relatively better at the wettest site."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:E5exOps3BD0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17069780747713337389", "cites_id": ["17069780747713337389"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea9760715", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LVhBhSYL5OwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
