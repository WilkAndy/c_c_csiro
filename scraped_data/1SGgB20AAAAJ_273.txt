In these experiments a number of different systems of grazing management were compared and each experiment was carried out at a different stocking rate. These experiments showed that at light stocking rates continuous grazing was better than rotational grazing. At high stocking rates it was found best to rotational graze from about five weeks after the start of the wet season up to about the sixth week in the early dry season and to continuously graze for the rest of the year."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:wmnBrZFLFP0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1626196814076970442", "cites_id": ["1626196814076970442"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00128325.1968.11662302", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ygXu7WJpkRYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1978": 1, "1979": 2, "1980": 0, "1981": 1, "1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
