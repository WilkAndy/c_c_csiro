Enabling sustainable development requires us to understand and apply resilience thinking, including the related notions of adaptation and transformation. For example, if a system is not performing well, or is at risk of crossing biophysical or socioeconomic thresholds that would take it into an undesirable state, it may be necessary to adapt or transform the system, before enhancing its resilience. Applying resilience thinking is critical to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals related to food security, land degradation neutrality and climate change adaptation. There are challenges, however, in operationalising resilience concepts. Decision-making to progress resilience goals requires methods to evaluate resilience, and identify needs with respect to adaptation and transformation. Successful implementation of adaptation plans requires systems thinking, stakeholder engagement, and adaptive management. Monitoring progress toward sustainable development goals requires methods for assessment, including relevant indicators. The Resilience, Adaptation Pathways and Transformation Assessment (RAPTA) framework was commissioned by the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to assist in addressing this need."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:hVd5agGqjXwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12697284428141543685", "cites_id": ["12697284428141543685"], "pub_url": "https://www.stapgef.org/sites/default/files/documents/Summary_RAPTA.pdf.-July-16.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BcF5D-rQNbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
