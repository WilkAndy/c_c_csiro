In tropical and subtropical savannas the herbaceous layer is dominated by C4 grasses, whereas the woody plants are C3 trees and shrubs. In temperate savannas the grasses are generally also C3. Because of their greater extent this chapter will focus on the tropical/subtropical savannas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10803513383894372842", "cites_id": ["10803513383894372842"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-0157-8_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6tEz5S7K7ZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
