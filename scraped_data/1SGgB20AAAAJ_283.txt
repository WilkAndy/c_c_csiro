Significant changes induced by Man were evident more than 5000 years ago in the Middle East, and probably in India and Asia, whereas in some parts of Africa they began only in this century.In the areas of ancient habitation the changes in ecosystem structure and function are difficult to trace, but where significant impact is recent and recorded, an interesting pattern emerges. East and Southern Africa, the south-western United States, Australia and, to some extent, Mexico, show an initial boom period with a dramatic decrease in indigenous herbivores coupled with a rapid increase in domestic livestock\u2014mainly cattle, sheep and goats (although the unintended explosion of rabbits in Australia can be linked to this phase).
