Three patients belonged to one family; seven patients had no known family history of the disease. One patient, a chronic invalid aged 56 years, produced a mild diabetic glucose tolerance curve and a delayed prolonged rise in serum insulin. Six of the group, including the three affected members from one family, exhibited normal glucose tolerance and fasting serum insulin values, but a markedly exaggerated rise in peripheral insulin levels maximal at 30 and 60 min. This abnormality showed no correlation with age of onset of the disease nor with severity of the muscle weakness. Growth hormone levels were normal in all of the patients studied. It is concluded that an excessive rise in circulating immunoreactive insulin in response to glucose is a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:YoqGh_aPxy4C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17284207735965376454", "cites_id": ["17284207735965376454"], "pub_url": "https://jmg.bmj.com/content/12/2/157.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xl9GNlzX3e8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 1, "1981": 2, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
