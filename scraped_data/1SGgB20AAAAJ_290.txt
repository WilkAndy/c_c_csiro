Working with resilience requires you to constantly reflect on what you\u2019re doing and why you\u2019re doing it. And once an assessment of resilience is done, you are encouraged to go back and reexamine it, expand on it, and then adapt accordingly. Our focus in most of this book is on the resilience of social-ecological systems (linked systems of humans and nature). Resilience is a dynamic property of such a system, and managing for it requires a dynamic and adaptive approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12277781754913741694", "cites_id": ["12277781754913741694"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.5822/978-1-61091-231-0_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fttno3RxY6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
