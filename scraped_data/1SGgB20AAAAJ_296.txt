My perspective is that of a scientist. What struck me, as I am sure it did many others, is the consolidation of a trend that emerged at the preceding Congress in Utah in 1995. At that Congress I demonstrated the decline over the last 100 years in the contribution that livestock production makes to the Australian gross domestic product (GDP). Since then, the trend has continued and increased; agriculture as a whole has just about maintained its contribution, but wool prices and other factors have worsened the position for the rangelands. Rangeland livestock production now contributes probably less than about 0.3% of GDP. The same picture holds for most other rangeland regions. Tom Bartlett's scenario (Bartlett et al., 1999) and Barney Foran's nine global drivers (Foran and Howden, 1999) support this proposition. Also at the Utah Congress, socio-economics emerged as a major gap in our understanding and research. My summary of contemporary papers in rangeland journals at that time revealed that only 13% of the papers could be described as socio-economics, and that most of these were of a local nature (Walker, 1995). A quick categorization of the papers presented at the VI International Rangeland Congress shows that some 23% of them fall into the socio-economics area.
