It is defined simply as the variety of all life forms and their patterns in space\u2013the different plants, animals and micro-organisms, the genes they contain and the ecosystems of which they form part. Importantly, it consists not only of the genes and the life forms themselves, but also includes the interactions between them and the environment. Thus there are three interactive levels of biodiversity; diversity at the genetic, the species, and the ecosystem levels. The term therefore covers a large array of ecological complexity and it is in general poorly understood.To most people, biodiversity is taken to mean species diversity. In fact, it is sometimes even more narrowly defined to cover just the conservation of rare or endangered species, usually the conspicuous flowering plants or vertebrates (known in conservation circles as the \u201ccharismatic megavertebrates\u201d). This erroneous interpretation leads to biodiversity being seen in an extremely restricted way. For example, in agricultural landscapes, many people assume that biodiversity is found only on conservation reserves, on uncleared agricultural land, or on remnant patches of bush on farming land, that may or may not be fenced-off (see Figure 1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2734511297624290180", "cites_id": ["2734511297624290180"], "pub_url": "https://www.wentworthgroup.org/docs/Biodiversity_and_Agriculture.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hDMwgYnv8iUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
