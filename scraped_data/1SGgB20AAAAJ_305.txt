Three levels of supplementary hay feeding, compared over this period, showed initial effects, but the final weight differences between treatments were not significant due to the effects of later compensatory growth. Differences between treatments during the weight loss and compensatory growth phases can be mainly attributed to differences in dry matter intake, rather than differences in actual body weight."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:-QO_JlXAMEAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15314867662621636331", "cites_id": ["15314867662621636331"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/experimental-agriculture/article/effects-of-feeding-hay-on-the-early-wet-season-weight-loss-of-cattle-in-western-tanzania/B220D6EE8275D80E64BC0E5ABF7BC0A3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6_atXP9WidQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
