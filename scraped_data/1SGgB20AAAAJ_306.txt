Few of them seemed to fit the smooth, continuous changes suggested by classic plant succession models. If we plotted the change in some feature of the rangeland we were interested in (species composition, basal cover) against time then it did change continuously, albeit not always smoothly. But if we plotted that feature against a variable thought to drive it (such as rainfall or grazing pressure) then in many cases it seemed there was an abrupt change at some level of the driver. Furthermore, while sometimes a reverse change in the driver would correspondingly reverse the rangeland feature, other times the situation seemed irreversible. Once this sort of change had \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:CPlVwKnI7G4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7448675760674448522", "cites_id": ["7448675760674448522"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/RJ/RJ20020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iiQQuiMDX2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
