Rather, it was just a preview of the official document that the Swedish Geotechnical Society published one year later, during the 12th International Conference of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1989. The former document presented an analysis of energy measurements that was based on the pioneer work by Schmertmann and Palacios (1979); and, as mentioned by the authors, used the F2 method. Schmertmann, by the way, was also one of the authors of the IRTP. Nevertheless, within the committee that elaborated the IRTP, no consensus existed about the adequacy of this method for evaluating the enthru energy of the SPT in any circumstances. Therefore, it was decided to omit that part of the report in the final and definitive version of the SPT International \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:TaF7eNGHiZkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11892533916140452502", "cites_id": ["11892533916140452502"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2006)132:12(1637)", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ljrWXpbECqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
