In spite of this, geotechnical engineers are often hesitant to measure SPT energy, due to high cost and uncertainty about data quality or reliability of energy calculation methods. Two spreadsheets that model the propagation of stress waves through simple and safety hammers were developed to address the issue of data quality. This paper describes the development of the spreadsheets, including critical aspects of hammer-anvil interaction not well-documented in the geotechnical literature. Spreadsheet output is verified by comparison with stress wave data collected under controlled conditions in the lab. The safety hammer spreadsheet is then used to assess the quality of stress wave data collected during an actual field investigation. The modeled and measured data are in good-to-excellent agreement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:T3x1S4x-kFYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17376984537402860279", "cites_id": ["17376984537402860279"], "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/664108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:92Jam15zJ_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
