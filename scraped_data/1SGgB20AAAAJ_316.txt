Green leaf is more strongly related to T at Katherine and to PASM at Lake Mere with the other sites in-between. Differences between species in terms of seasonal growth phenology were minor, at all sites, and there were no meaningful patterns in percentage contributions by the species to sward biomass. A strong inter-seasonal rainfall pattern over the period of the study may have masked phenological differences between species, but it is also possible that changes in species composition very soon after livestock were introduced resulted in a decline in phenological differentiation.
