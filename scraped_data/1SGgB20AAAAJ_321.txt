In some patients tolerance to bromocriptine is poor and the drug has to be stopped because of nausea and vomiting. Metergoline (8-B-carbobenzyl-ossiaminomethyl-1, 6-dimethyl-10-alpha-ergoline), a serotonin antagonist, has been used elsewhere in Europe to suppress puerperal lactation,'but there have been few clinical trials of metergoline in hyperprolactinaemia or normoprolactinaemic galactorrhoea. This preliminary report describes our clinical experience of using metergoline as an alternative treatment in patients intolerant of bromocriptine."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:KXHmhzr5f2IC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10553508571538031006", "cites_id": ["10553508571538031006"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1415939/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:noGQhCGYdZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
