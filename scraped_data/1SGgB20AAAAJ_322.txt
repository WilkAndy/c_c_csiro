In one, the ecosystem is merely an epiphenomenon of processes at lower levels of organization. There is no selection and optimization at the level of the ecosystem. In the other view, ecosystems are coevolutionary units and units of selection. They evolve towards optimization at system level, a state that may not be optimal to the needs of the included organisms and species. No-one has been able to disprove convincingly either hypothesis in any particular case. Two classes of properties that apply at the ecosystem level are suggested. The first concerns the rates, efficiencies and patterns of energy and nutrient movement through the system. The second concerns the stability and resilience properties of the system and therefore focusses not on out-using some other type of system as does the first, but out-lasting it. An example of ecosystem resilience is given. It is concluded that selection can and does occur at more than one level and that the existence of at least some species today is due to the fact that selection for system-level properties allowed the ecosystem of which they are part to persist, and not to be replaced by some other system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4599861503798993327", "cites_id": ["4599861503798993327"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4599861503798993327&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r-Hupar91T8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1}}
