However, it is only in the last 30 years that botanical methods have been incorporated into programmes of mineral exploration. There are two major approaches to the use of vegetation in locating ore bodies:(i) Geobotany which relies on interpreting floristic features associated with mineralization, commonly by the recognition of\" indicator\" species.(ii) Biogeochemistry, involving chemical analysis of plant material, and the detection of abnormally high concentrations of the elements under investigation.Studies of the vegetation on mineralized soils in Rhodesia were initiated several years ago and include a broad floristic survey of the vegetation on copper and nickel soils (Wild, 1968 and 1970), the distribution of species and their metal contents on the copper soils around Mangula (Jacobsen, 1967 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13982078537271177255", "cites_id": ["13982078537271177255"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/23502160", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J3Cpc1lSCsIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1}}
