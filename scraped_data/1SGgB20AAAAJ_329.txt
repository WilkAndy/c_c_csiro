The pasture treatment that supported the highest annual weight gains (254 kg/steer) in a stocking-rate experiment had 1.7 steers/ha. Mean annual rain                                                           682fall was 1,490 mm, with 70% falling from December to March. Monthly average temperatures are highest in December (30.1\u00b0C) and lowest in July (11.9\u00b0C). Pastures were sampled in 1973 (seven 3-day periods) and 1975-1976 (six 3-day periods) with three esophageal fistulated steers. Extrusa samples were analyzed for nitrogen (N), in-vitro digestibility (IVD), and botanical composition. Pasture yield and composition were determined and herbage samples were analyzed for N in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11469462247531828801", "cites_id": ["11469462247531828801"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780429303142-235/diet-selection-cattle-tropical-pastures-northern-australia-walker-rutherford-whiteman", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QVbjdCW3K58J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
