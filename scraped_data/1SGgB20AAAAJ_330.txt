At the cost of agricultural production overall cost of energy resources is growing: in 2000 was 36.5 billion rubles, 2008-92 billion rubles, 2009-110.6 billion rubles, and in 2010 rose to 119.8 billion rubles, or increased by 3.3 times. The analysis of consumption of the main energy sources for the period from 1990 to 2010 showed a decrease in general and the specific consumption of diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity by 5-7 times. Reducing energy consumption is explained as a forced saving resources because of lack of funds for the acquisition and implementation of agricultural enterprises of energy and resource saving measures (resource-saving technologies in the production process, motor fuel, biofuels and alternative energy sources). To solve this problem State and business in a matter of priority should be to build an effective system of innovation development for agriculture, promote the participation of agricultural science and education system in this process, modernize the domestic agricultural machinery, engineering and technology infrastructure.\""}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:wXeZnHswOLwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8054776862875708580", "cites_id": ["8054776862875708580"], "pub_url": "https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/7943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pOy9eOFQyG8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
