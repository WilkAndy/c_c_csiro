N/ha.) and phosphate (up to 50 kg. P/ha.) on a Cenchrus ciliaris pasture. Dry matter yield increased with up to 160 kg. N and dry matter content also increased with nitrogen, whereas crude protein contents were initially lowered and then increased by the higher rates of nitrogen. These differences are attributed to changes in the leaf/framework ratio. The crude protein yield increased with each nitrogen level. Sulphate of ammonia markedly lowered the soil pH. The only responses to phosphate were when it was cultivated into the top soil, when there was a small increase in yield and a fall in crude protein."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:Hl4CZ0n6gBQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6217764119598174896", "cites_id": ["6217764119598174896"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/experimental-agriculture/article/effects-of-nitrogen-and-phosphate-on-cenchrus-ciliaris-at-ukiriguru-western-tanzania/B0FCA327635CF5D7899CA4D3F2951A1C", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sJLRDYbvSVYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1975": 1, "1976": 0, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 1, "1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 1}}
