The use of the term \u2018resilience\u2019has risen markedly in recent years in response to growing awareness and uneasiness about looming shocks. They include global and regional financial crises, climate and weather shocks, pandemics, social unrest, regional wars and refugees, among others. These are rising in frequency. The frequency of such events worldwide is reminiscent of Winston Churchill\u2019s famous volume The Gathering Storm: we have that sense of the gathering storm and wonder what we can do. Will we be able to cope? That question is worrying many people, and that may suggest why we find the term resilience so much in use today. So, will we be able to cope?Two recent surveys of the Australian media have checked thousands of sources for every occurrence of the word \u2018resilience\u2019to look at what it meant, and they show how its use is rising and how very different are two common uses. The first one suggests the view that if authorities try to help people too much they do not bother to look after themselves, while the other is exactly opposite, expressing a hope that the concept of resilience does not erode into a justification for denying help to communities. So, there are two ends of a continuum about what to do and how much to help people. Nevertheless, this term has greatly different meanings in the minds of many people. In essence resilience is a framework for understanding how persistence and transformation coexist in living systems. In Chapter 5 of this volume, Peter Ho has talked about \u2018complex systems\u2019; I \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17945066473924589153", "cites_id": ["17945066473924589153"], "pub_url": "https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/33378/1/496491.pdf#page=140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YfYLieGuCfkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
