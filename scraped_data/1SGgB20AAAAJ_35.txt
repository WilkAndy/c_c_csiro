However, research into this topic has been hampered by a lack of empirical data. This paper describes a developing database established to address this need. The database is freely available and comprises a set of summarized published examples and a searchable bibliographic database of publications on the topic. Thresholds in the database are characterized in terms of a standardized set of 24 descriptors, including the variables along which they occur, the variables that change, and the factors that have driven the change. Readers are encouraged to contribute new examples. Examples range from conceptual models to empirical evidence. The former predominate in the literature and, although they make valuable contributions and will continue to be included \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 757, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6470275479875477604", "cites_id": ["6470275479875477604"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26267674", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZODlmEQJy1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 13, "2006": 29, "2007": 32, "2008": 36, "2009": 39, "2010": 52, "2011": 52, "2012": 54, "2013": 49, "2014": 41, "2015": 61, "2016": 53, "2017": 55, "2018": 43, "2019": 44, "2020": 35, "2021": 23, "2022": 28, "2023": 6}}
