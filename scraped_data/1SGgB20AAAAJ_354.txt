He cites the writings of Voisin (unreferenced) and others as evidence that grazing stimulates grass growth. Experimental evidence on the stimulation of grasses by grazing is not common, although we acknowledge that it exists. Some of the best hard evidence for compensatory growth by grasses following defoliation comes from the work of McNaughton and colleagues in the Serengeti. Although some work was reported on the effects of herbivore saliva as a stimulant for grass growth, research on this effect has not been replicated and has largely fallen by the wayside.\""}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17067482178965892741", "cites_id": ["17067482178965892741"], "pub_url": "https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/2638", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hW6SR53g2-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
