The model is a simplification of the Century model and the Forest-Biogeochemical model. Topics covered include plant production, decomposition and nutrient cycling, biomes, the utility of the carbon flow model for predicting carbon dynamics under global change, and possible applications to state-and-transition models and environmentally driven global vegetation models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16465055385263183797", "cites_id": ["16465055385263183797"], "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940026125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tZe-JaOgf-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
