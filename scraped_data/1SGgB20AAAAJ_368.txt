They also highlight both the rudimentary state of our knowledge of these systems and the lack of any unifying concepts relating to their structure and functioning. Two main factors account for this situation. First, compared with other biomes, there has been little intensive research in savannas. With a few notable exceptions, studies in these vast tropical wooded grasslands have been largely the domain of plant geographers, agriculturists and, in Africa, conservationists. It is only in the last few years that serious attempts have been made to understand the ways in which they work. Secondly, the conflicting opinions on savanna ecology expressed in the literature are a reflection of often narrow, individual views taken from geographically and culturally isolated positions rather than being due to inherent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11063331839168001025", "cites_id": ["11063331839168001025"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-68786-0_30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AbTgEbHZiJkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
