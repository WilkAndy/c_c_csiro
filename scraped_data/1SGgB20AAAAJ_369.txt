A step-wise procedure for       building this type of model is descriptionbed, and a generalized model with 24 functional compartments for an African wildlife ecosystem is presented. Spatial heterogeneity is included on a       very large scale in the form of three site-types based on permanency of drinking water. Seasonal movement of animals between site-types occurs. Improvements to the model discussed involve the       inclusion of spatial heterogeneity on a scale commensurate with the precision of the remainder of the model, stochasticisation of most processes, inclusion of non-linear and time-varying       transfer coefficients, structuring of the biomass into species, age and sex classes, and inclusion of biological control mechanisms.
