The community on the more sandy soil is a broad-leaf woody savanna and the other a more open microphyllous Acacia community. (2) Vegetative growth and soil water were monitored over a 2-year period in control plots and in plots cleared of one of the vegetation components. (3) In the broad-leaf community the effect of the herbaceous vegetation on the woody plants is negligible. (4) In the Acacia community with seven times more herbaceous biomass, mature woody-plant growth was reduced by competition from the grass-dominated herb layer particularly in the first (wetter) year. The vertical root distributions and soil-water data indicate that the grasses take up topsoil (0-30 cm) water sufficiently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 661, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8069865345265769968", "cites_id": ["8069865345265769968"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2259780", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8B3Nicbr_W8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 3, "1986": 2, "1987": 6, "1988": 7, "1989": 12, "1990": 9, "1991": 11, "1992": 10, "1993": 12, "1994": 8, "1995": 16, "1996": 10, "1997": 23, "1998": 21, "1999": 19, "2000": 23, "2001": 18, "2002": 13, "2003": 24, "2004": 23, "2005": 22, "2006": 28, "2007": 29, "2008": 20, "2009": 24, "2010": 29, "2011": 22, "2012": 25, "2013": 25, "2014": 28, "2015": 24, "2016": 17, "2017": 14, "2018": 20, "2019": 22, "2020": 15, "2021": 6, "2022": 16, "2023": 2}}
