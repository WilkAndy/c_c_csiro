To meet this challenge Washington State Emergency Management has supported the development of an evaluation program since 2001 to monitor and continually improve its earthquake and tsunami education and preparedness programs. The overall conclusion of the initial studies was that the hazard education program up to that time had been successful in terms of promoting awareness of and access to information about tsunami hazard among the residents. However, despite success in disseminating hazard information, levels of preparedness were recorded at low to moderate levels. Following the initial evaluation a range of educational materials and outreach initiatives were developed to address the key research findings and ongoing evaluations have tracked changes in community preparedness. Our research and education has used multiple research and outreach approaches to bring about measureable change in the earthquake and tsunami preparedness of coastal Washington residents."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:FqkprvusZAMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=219050758699998395", "cites_id": ["219050758699998395"], "pub_url": "https://dc.etsu.edu/etsu-works/15922/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u9wXJIE5CgMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
