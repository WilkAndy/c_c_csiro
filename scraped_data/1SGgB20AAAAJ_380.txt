Viewed in this way, terrestrial landscapes can be thought of as self-organizing systems of topographically determined physical/chemical factors interacting with the biological components that occupy them. The resulting patterns of biological communities are strongly influenced by human use and management activities. This becomes extreme when the landscape is fragmented by human use and consists mostly of agricultural or other nonnative cover with separated patches of native communities. Marinescapes are less subject to fragmentation effects, but their biological communities are also structured by spatial processes and ecological dynamics that are equivalent, albeit markedly different, to those that occur in terrestrial landscapes.Starting with the terrestrial world, an understanding of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:xBbUbSzpRCkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12153345293507353035", "cites_id": ["12153345293507353035"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12153345293507353035&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y9krPCdbqagJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
