It places an emphasis on identifying thresholds between such regimes, how to intervene in ways to avoid unwanted regime shifts and how to enhance the resilience of desired regimes. Examples of physical, biological and biophysical threshold effects are presented, leading to a tentative set of \u2018design\u2019principles. Landscapes are linked social-ecological systems. They are self-organizing systems that are restructured by a few key drivers, and their nonlinear dynamics, especially in the social component, call for an adaptive governance approach (Dietz et al. 2003). A command-and-control approach to achieving some perceived optimal state is likely to fail."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14639346862188193837", "cites_id": ["14639346862188193837"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Ac9ucIh2VDUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA395&dq=info:Leh0mGhoKcsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=W04rCvT5W2&sig=aDO49eN26_OlVEc5r7RtPDGWwlM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Leh0mGhoKcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
