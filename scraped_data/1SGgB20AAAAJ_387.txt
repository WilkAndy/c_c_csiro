The capability of high performance liquid chromatography connected in series to an ultraviolet detector and mass spectrometer (HPLC-UV-MS) to identify and characterise organic impurities has been assessed. Organic impurities were separated on an HPLC column and then detected, and in some cases identified, using a UV absorption detector and mass spectrometer (MS). Numerous organic impurities were separated while the run time for analysis was less than 60 min. As a result of this work, chemical structures of eight organic impurities present in raw sugar were tentatively identified."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:rlkjS_mI7T0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12245230828646155034", "cites_id": ["12245230828646155034"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12245230828646155034&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GsMdho_M76kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
