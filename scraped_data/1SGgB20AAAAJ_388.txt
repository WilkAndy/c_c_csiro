Soc", "pages": "1-9", "abstract": "Although global change is often equated to\" climate change\", or even to\" global warming\", it encompasses much more. The working definition of global change adopted by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and much of the global change research community includes three components (IGBP, 1990):(i) change in atmospheric composition,(ii) climate change,(iii) change in land use. Of these, both changes in atmospheric composition and land use are well documented and are occurring now. There is still some debate about climate change, since it is too early to detect an unmistakable signal of anthropogenically forced climate change above the noise, but there is widespread agreement within the scientific community that changing atmospheric composition will lead to climate change (Houghton et al., 1991).Land-use change is usually associated with developing countries, where dramatic changes in land cover are occurring (eg, the conversion of humid tropical forests to agricultural uses). However, change in intensity of existing land use may also play an important role in global change, particularly with respect to emission or sequestration of greenhouse gases. In the context of Australian rangelands, the most readily varied component of the system is stocking rate, and if this changes (for example, in response to policies promoting\" sustainable development\"), the rangelands' role in biogeochemical cycles could also change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1347181564265493573", "cites_id": ["1347181564265493573"], "pub_url": "https://austrangesoc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/arsbc-1992.pdf#page=22", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RfT_uX4mshIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1}}
