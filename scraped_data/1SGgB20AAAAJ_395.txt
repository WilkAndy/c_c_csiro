N fertilizers substantially increased herbage and livestock production. Stylosanthes humilis was the only forage legume successfully introduced into the natural pasture so far.-AVB"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:WliCQ7fkH-wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3532141279240808049", "cites_id": ["3532141279240808049"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19700701645", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cWakhcevBDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1978": 1, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 1}}
