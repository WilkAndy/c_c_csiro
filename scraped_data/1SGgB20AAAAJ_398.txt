The ATR system first performs a wavelet filtering to enhance the contrast of the hair features in the image. The system then extracts the unique features of the targets and sends the features to an Adaboost based classifier for training and recognition operations. The ATR system automatically classifies the hair, moles, or other skin lesion and provides the accurate coordinates of the intended hair follicle locations. The coordinates can be used to guide a scanning laser to focus energy only on the hair follicles. The intended benefit would be to protect the skin from unwanted laser exposure and to provide more effective skin therapy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:GiKYRl9V4EwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=56849646933546748", "cites_id": ["56849646933546748"], "pub_url": "https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/42778", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_JYU43P4yQAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
