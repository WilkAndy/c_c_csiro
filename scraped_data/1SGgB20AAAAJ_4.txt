This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 10945, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17982450286846888428,788325466232410303,637216412275289006", "cites_id": ["17982450286846888428", "788325466232410303", "637216412275289006"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.287.5459.1770", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7EmhwkJ_jvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 29, "2001": 75, "2002": 89, "2003": 122, "2004": 181, "2005": 194, "2006": 238, "2007": 290, "2008": 330, "2009": 437, "2010": 454, "2011": 548, "2012": 587, "2013": 645, "2014": 718, "2015": 756, "2016": 729, "2017": 700, "2018": 702, "2019": 687, "2020": 679, "2021": 730, "2022": 615, "2023": 270}}
