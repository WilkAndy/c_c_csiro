This paper expands the focus to include similar dynamics in social and economic systems, in which multiple variables may act together in ways that produce interacting regime shifts in social-ecological systems. We use four different regions in the world, each of which contains multiple thresholds, to develop a proposed \u201cgeneral model\u201d of threshold interactions in social-ecological systems. The model identifies patch-scale ecological thresholds, farm- or landscape-scale economic thresholds, and regional-scale sociocultural thresholds. \u201cCascading thresholds,\u201d i.e., the tendency of the crossing of one threshold to induce the crossing of other thresholds, often lead to very resilient, although often less desirable, alternative states."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 587, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4292548098936352396", "cites_id": ["4292548098936352396"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26267808", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jC5hysAxkjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 6, "2007": 18, "2008": 29, "2009": 26, "2010": 28, "2011": 30, "2012": 39, "2013": 30, "2014": 48, "2015": 49, "2016": 46, "2017": 42, "2018": 41, "2019": 33, "2020": 33, "2021": 40, "2022": 31, "2023": 8}}
