Report to Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Canberra", "abstract": "Communities whose livelihoods are dependent on natural resources face a critical situation when there are substantial changes to the availability of or access to those resources. A worst case result is a \u2018ghost town\u2019\u2013observable in Australian and US history when there\u2019s nothing financially viable left to mine. For today\u2019s rural communities threatened by reduced irrigation, forestry or even long-term changes in rainfall patterns, this result is hardly the desired option. Many individuals in such communities are highly attached to their place. Its history and landscape have become integral to their individual and community identities, and many refuse to abandon their place and its community. We thus arrive at the notion of rural, place-based and resource-dependent communities, often characterised in the popular imagination as being highly resilient to the adversities that come with being dependent on natural resources. They\u2019ve bounced back before; they\u2019ll bounce back again.History reveals the transitions and transformations that have enabled rural, place-based and resource-dependent communities to grow and survive. For communities that have grown up with irrigation development, the establishment of irrigation was itself a transformation\u2013sometimes government inspired, sponsored and led; sometimes driven by individual entrepreneurialism (Blackburn, 2004; Hallows & Thompson, 1996; Lewis, 1994). On the other hand, critics observe the disastrous transformations associated with the downfall of ancient irrigation-dependent empires, thus questioning the long-term sustainability of irrigation as practised in some parts of the world (eg Postel, 1999 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8709992847410035590", "cites_id": ["8709992847410035590"], "pub_url": "https://cdn.csu.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/702860/61_Wakool_report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hnsR4lgc4HgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
