The Standard Penetration Test (SPT) N-value is widely used in geotechnical engineering as a basis for foundation design and as the primary index of liquefaction resistance. The main factor affecting the N-value is the energy delivered to the rods by the hammer. As measured N-values are conventionally corrected to a standard energy level of 60% of the standard potential energy, it is necessary to measure the energy input. Research into the measurement of energy during SPT testing has been conducted since the 1970s. The early work was based on measurement of the force time history alone (F\u00b2 method). In recent years, the Force-Velocity (FV) method) has been suggested to be superior to the F\u00b2 method. It requires the measurement of acceleration in addition to force, with velocity determined by integration of the acceleration. As the values of energy obtained by the F\u00b2 and FV approaches are often different, this research project was conducted to investigate the reasons for such differences and to develop recommendations for equipment, instrumentation and testing procedures, which would allow more accurate and consistent energy measurements in SPT. The work consisted of review of available energy measurement data, laboratory study of the energy transfer process and of the performance of the individual components of energy measurement systems and full-scale measurements under controlled conditions in the laboratory and in the field. The experimental work was carried out in conjunction with numerical modelling of the energy transfer process. The work confirmed that the FV \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:p11oD0Q27JMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9950029713586046567", "cites_id": ["9950029713586046567"], "pub_url": "https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/52383/52383/items/1.0048557", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z8bglk6bFYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
