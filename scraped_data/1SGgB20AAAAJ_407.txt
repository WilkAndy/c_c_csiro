They are characterized by having strongly seasonal climates and a mixture of grasses and woody vegetation that is strongly influenced by fire and grazing animals. Inter-pretations of the control of the grass: woody balance have evolved from one of a stable equilibrium combination to an unstable mixture that can be driven for long periods into a state that is so strongly dominated by woody plants that it excludes fire. In the delivery of savanna goods and services most attention has focused on livestock production, as exemplified by the optimal control models described by Perrings and Walker (1997). However, where savannas are used for multiple pur-poses (food plants, livestock production, livestock for draught, fuel wood, crop production, and perhaps other ecosystem services), a top-down optimization ap-proach is less likely to be successful. It may be better for such savannas to con-sider them as complex adaptive systems and to try to understand the trajectories the system might follow (in terms of trees, grass, animals, crops, economics, etc.). With an understanding of what influences the directions of possible trajectories it might be possible to learn how to nudge the system away from trajectories that are clearly undesirable, keeping the system changing along those that are more likely to achieve sustainability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10479394199466673972", "cites_id": ["10479394199466673972"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10479394199466673972&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NAeAkIBJbpEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
