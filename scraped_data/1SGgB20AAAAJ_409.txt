Organic impurities were separated on an HPLC column and then detected, and in some cases identified, using a UV absorption detector and a mass spectrometer. As a result of this preliminary work, chemical structures of eight organic impurities present in raw sugar were tentatively identified. It is envisaged that many more impurities present in raw sugar and other sugar factory products can be identified using this instrument."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:aEPHIGigqugC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=427247296462611390", "cites_id": ["427247296462611390"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.qut.edu.au/231202/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vmPmCCfj7QUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
