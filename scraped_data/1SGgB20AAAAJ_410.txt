I have to agree with much of what he says, and acknowledge that a lack of\" reflection before action\"(which is another way of describing the use of an ecological model in an adaptive management framework) is the norm in present\u2212 day resource management and planning. Gordon uses forest management to highlight the discrepancy between what planners and managers need in the way of information, in terms of scales and levels of integration, and the inadequate\" building blocks\" that ecological scientists publish. For science and real\u2212 world management to come together in a truly beneficial way, there are three requirements that need to follow each other in an iterative manner:(1) we need Baskerville's\" reflection\", an explicit, dynamic ecological model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1598599331992186484", "cites_id": ["1598599331992186484"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26271655", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dC6SaZ9dLxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
