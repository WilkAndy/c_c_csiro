The authors point out, for instance, that'six times more plant taxonomists are needed to study the world's flora to an adequate extent before it is too late'. It would take another book to document the plants that have become extinct since IUCN set up the Threatened Plants Committee in 1974 (after Melville's (1970) early Red Data Book estimated that 20 000-25 000 plant species were threatened in some way). Despite the monumental task, IUCN have made steady progress with their plants database and an updated Red Data Book (Lucas & Synge 1978) of 250 species has resulted. Progress of the database is mapped on pp. xxx-xxxi of the present book (South America is ominously blank \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:H_6PQ7K5Sg8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6360498228467878048", "cites_id": ["6360498228467878048"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6360498228467878048&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oEhUfnAHRVgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
