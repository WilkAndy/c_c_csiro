Data were sourced from the iKnowMed electronic medical record system which included both real-world and trial patients allowing for their direct comparison. We used the 1: 1 greedy nearest neighbor matching method based on propensity scores with a caliper of 0.1 to balance the sample by age, body mass index, race, weeks since diagnoses, stage, ECOG status, hormone receptor status, number \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:iLjPvThLa1EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(21)00537-4/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
