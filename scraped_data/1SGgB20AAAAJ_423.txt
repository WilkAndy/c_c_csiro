However, the GSD of a deposit may reflect processes that occur after the initial fragmentation at the vent. In particular, during pyroclast transport, processes of secondary fragmentation, expansion via continued vesiculation, and deformation of the particles may modify the apparent TGSD of the final deposits. Therefore, it is important to quantify and exclude the effects of these secondary processes.
