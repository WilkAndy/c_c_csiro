It might be surprising to learn that this versatile tool may also be used to measure and optimize the power supply systems which drive digital, analog, or RF circuits.Possible power supply measurements include output impedance, output stability, power supply rejection ratio (PSRR), and reverse isolation. Each of these measurements are important to verify and optimize a design for best stability and noise performance. The ideal output impedance of a power supply such as a switching regulator or a low drop out (LDO) regulator is \u201cflat\u201d from very low frequencies to the highest frequency which is present in the circuit."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:4Ol-GlP6dRYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian-Walker-12/publication/343858001_Using_a_VNA_for_Power_Plane_Impedance_Analysis_Signal_Integrity_Journal_Using_a_VNA_for_Power_Plane_Impedance_Analysis/links/5f450f46458515b7294ff833/Using-a-VNA-for-Power-Plane-Impedance-Analysis-Signal-Integrity-Journal-Using-a-VNA-for-Power-Plane-Impedance-Analysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r_2K7xQQdXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
