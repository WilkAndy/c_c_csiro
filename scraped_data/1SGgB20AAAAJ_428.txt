This extract from the work by Brian Walker, a specialist in the study of resilience in natural environments and human communities, comes from his latest book, Finding Resilience: Change and Uncertainty in Nature and Society. It offers some the fascinating stories from around the world - and some peculiar to Australia - that reveal what resilience is, how it works in different kinds of systems, how it is expressed, and how it can be gained and lost."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:18U4RWrXZp4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.669413830238680", "cites_per_year": {}}
