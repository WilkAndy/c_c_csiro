A final monitoring campaign of the lake's surface in early 2018 secured a valuable dataset constraining the physical processes of lava lake outgassing. Following hour-long periods of quiescent lava rise, the lake level drops within considerably shorter time, characterized by the violent release of gas. Investigation in the gas release mechanism can ultimately help to better understand gas accumulation processes beneath the surface of the lava lake."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:grZTYWtF7b0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.V14A..04H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
