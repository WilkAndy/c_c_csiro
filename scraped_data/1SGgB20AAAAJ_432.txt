Using portfolio theory as a conceptual framework, we explore how current interconnections between the aquaculture, crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors act as an impediment to, or an opportunity for, enhanced resilience in the global food system given increased resource scarcity and climate change. Aquaculture can potentially enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and feeding strategies. However, aquaculture\u2019s reliance on terrestrial crops and wild fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites, and its broad array of environmental impacts diminishes its ability to add resilience. Feeds for livestock and farmed fish that are fed rely largely on the same crops, although the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:_-QPzy9dQywC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/does_aquaculture_add_resilience_to_the_global_food_system", "cites_per_year": {}}
