Significant changes induced by Man were evident more than 5000 years ago in the Middle East, and probably in India and Asia, whereas in some parts of Africa they began only in this century.In the areas of ancient habitation the changes in ecosystem structure and function are difficult to trace, but where significant impact is recent and recorded, an interesting pattern emerges. East and Southern Africa, the south-westem United States, Australia and, to some extent, Mexico, show an initial boom period with a dramatic decrease in indigenous herbivores coupled with a rapid increase in domestic livestock-\u2014mainly cattle, sheep and goats (although the unintended explosion of rabbits in Australia can be linked to this phase). Severe ecological degradation, usually triggered by a period of drought, then resulted in an economic collapse. Animal numbers declined markedly (often as a result of death), and this in turn has been followed by a gradual improvement through the process of secondary succession. The management strategies which were subsequently developed seem to have benefitted from the earlier mistakes. In Mexico, conditions reached an optimum state around the turn of the century, and have since declined. In the Sahel, and in parts of India and Southern and East Africa, the situation is likewise declining. Elsewhere, although conditions can by no means be described as good, some sort of stability has been regained, albeit with a different vegetation structure. There is, however, widespread concern that a new and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xR47AAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA377&dq=info:kvv6Zd_wUeIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=I9mhyAuw_C&sig=whiD8Z-5CTCeHckixFetq5O67U4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kvv6Zd_wUeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
