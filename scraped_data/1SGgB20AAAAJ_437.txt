The presence of water made them favored places for animals and people alike, and they have long histories of human use and manipulation. And it\u2019s the manipulation that is of interest from a resilience perspective, since it has invariably resulted in unintended secondary effects. We begin our swamp tour with a discussion of two major wetland systems in the developing world: the Okavango Delta in Botswana and Tonle Sap in Cambodia (see images 9 and 10). Both are very valuable assets for the countries involved, and both depend on the continued flow of water from countries upstream."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.5822/978-1-61091-231-0_10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-YHFfnzmdcoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
