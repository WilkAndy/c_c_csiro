They produce different crops in dramatically different environments using different traditions. However, dig a little deeper and it\u2019s clear there are many similarities underlying their resilience, a property that has seen them weather many disturbances and yet continue to operate successfully over centuries. Also in common is a growing vulnerability to modern growth and globalization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.5822/978-1-61091-231-0_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2STPgddlEQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
