The field of seascape ecology, also referred to as ecological geography of the sea, seeks fundamental understanding of spatial and temporal variability in habitat stru. cture and its relationships to ecosystem function, including solar energy capture and dissipation, trophic interactions and their effects on nutrient dynamics, and patterns and controls of biodiversity. Implicit in the study of seascape ecology is an interest in the management of global resources through the development of new theory, the establishment of long-term ecological observation programs, and the dissemination of knowledge to society at large."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16499559181746351016&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qKuGSqg1-uQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
