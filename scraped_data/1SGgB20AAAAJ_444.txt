As a consequence, options and alternatives are being lost globally in such ecosystem components as species and genotypes (FAO 1993), as well as in such social system components as languages, institutions (Ostrom 2005), local knowledge and information, and sets of actions that agents might take (Pardon 1995; Folke, Colding, and Berkes 2003). However, there is a growing recognition that diversity is a key requirement for long-term (sustainable) functioning of systems\u2014biological and social (Low et al. 2003). We will demonstrate here that there are many fundamental reasons why diversity matters that are general enough to apply to two very different settings: species in ecosystems and institutions in gov-ernance. Our aim is to identify those aspects of diversity that are important, why they are important, how they matter for the system, and how they can be managed.Contemporary theory on complex adaptive systems recognizes that some processes are needed to sustain diversity in order to maintain options for change over time (Schmalensee 1972; Levin 1998; Ostrom 1998, Edelman and Gally 2001). Diversity itself is, therefore, a dynamic attribute, and understanding the processes that alter and maintain diversity is an important step in defining the possibilities of creating sustainable social-ecological"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:hzzPUFEODy8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RBBOarefKC8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA46&dq=info:isfxpwDPUWIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=PQAHXAFdkJ&sig=-63ssf9B5WLK8Pkxi097PlSQ9F0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:isfxpwDPUWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
