The authors attributed the occurrence of displacements of various forms and levels of the mats essentially to the liquefaction or cyclic softening of the saturated fine surface soils of ML/CL type, which dominated those sites. Subsequently, through contrasting the presumed field liquefaction to the analysis results, they evaluated the predictive capability of field-penetration-testing-based liquefaction triggering procedures. It was concluded that in Adapazari, the soils, though they contained significant amounts of clay-size particles and had grain-size distributions within ranges that were believed not to be susceptible to liquefaction, yet liquefied.Among others, the major drawback of the paper under discussion appears to be a priori reasoning of soil liquefaction to explain the observed displacements without a preliminary consideration of whether the bearing capacity failure of the foundations were likely in the cases presented when the seismic demand on building-foundation systems was taken into account. We question this issue, as well as the likelihood of liquefaction of the fine surface deposits encountered in Adapazari during 1999 Kocaeli earthquake."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:BBcCmHsDWsAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://info.tensarcorp.com/hubfs/Western%20Hemisphere%20Project%20Files/WH_Claims%20of%20Equivalency/(ASCE)1090-0241(2006)132_4(549).pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9GGkIudeclcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
