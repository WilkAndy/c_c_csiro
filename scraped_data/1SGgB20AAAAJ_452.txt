Retention practices incremental to the retention of Wildlife Tree Patches (WTPs) include the retention of dead and downed wood (Coarse Woody Debris, CWD), snag retention, stubbing, retention of residual patches of immature conifer, retention of deciduous stems and individual large live conifer stems, and overstorey retention involving small gap openings or true partial harvests (eg% removal or diameter limit cuts). Retention practices may be applied within special management zones (eg Riparian Management Zones (RMZs)), applied to key areas of management concern (eg around wildlife habitat features (eg"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:tC_cyO4PokcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6405631839681742431&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X4YpPjhg5VgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
