The first two points are not new. Not everyone agrees on just how important they are, but they are widely recognized and despite some positive indicators in some parts of the world (eg, Ausubel, 2000) many scientists would agree with the comments made in regard to these first two points. The third point, the failure of cultural evolution to keep pace with technological evolution, flows from Paul Erhlich's new book Human Natures, and is one that deserves particular attention. It is appropriate to begin, however, by considering the ways in which the first two points influence the difficulties the Ehrlichs attribute to the relatively slow pace of cultural evolution. The interaction between the consumption patterns of humans and this disparity in rates offers one reason why degradation of natural capital occurs when no-one wants it to happen. The issue of consumption is complicated by the fact that its effects no longer feed back directly and quickly to the consumers. As globalization proceeds, the gap widens. The natural capital consequences of the consumption patterns of residents in Manhattan, Manila or Mexico City are not experienced by them. The effects are felt in the regions providing the raw \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:NNPL2XyPKO8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9159901855891149113&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OVHV6TSCHn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
