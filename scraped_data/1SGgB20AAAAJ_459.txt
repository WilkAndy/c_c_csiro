The Old World rangelands have a very long history of use, and their present struc-ture and composition have been sculpted over many hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of years of pastoral activities. But it is over the past one hundred or so years that many of them, in Africa, North and South America, Aus-, tralia, and parts of central and south Asia, have experienced major change. Increasing degradation seems to have accompanied the advances in technology in animal husbandry and water development. This overview is restricted to the semi-arid and arid rangelands where regular, arable agriculture is precluded by insufficient rainfall. Subsistence farmers in these regions attempt to cultivate crops (sorghum and millet, and sometimes maize) in promising rainy seasons, but the mainstay for survival and commercial production is livestock and (under subsistence conditions) harvesting the native biota."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:279hWsFo9KEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10624214558875291237&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZY5LD9rKcJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
