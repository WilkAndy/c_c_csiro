They are outpacing the development of institutions to deal with them and their many interactive effects. The core of the problem is inducing cooperation in situations where individuals and nations will collectively gain if all cooperate, but each faces the temptation to take a free ride on the cooperation of others. The nation-state achieves cooperation by the exercise of sovereign power within its boundaries. The difficulty to date is that transnational institutions provide, at best, only partial solutions, and implementation of even these solutions can be undermined by internation competition and recalcitrance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 467, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18406661168472823001", "cites_id": ["18406661168472823001"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1175325", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2ZTMX8-Ycf8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 8, "2010": 32, "2011": 32, "2012": 32, "2013": 40, "2014": 36, "2015": 39, "2016": 36, "2017": 48, "2018": 29, "2019": 45, "2020": 28, "2021": 24, "2022": 23, "2023": 9}}
