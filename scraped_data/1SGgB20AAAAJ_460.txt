Since desertification interests a broad variety of disciplines, it is not surprising that communication problems arise\u2014not only regarding the attribution of causes and choice of approaches, but also in its definition. We move beyond these obstacles by proposing a framework for desertification at the household and farm (HH/F) level, which is based on a set of assumptions that, while general, yield testable hypotheses. Our new conceptual model suggests a research agenda to:(i) identify the small set of crucial variables that collectively govern the dynamics of ecosystem services;(ii) distinguish between \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d variables;(iii) define the position and nature of thresholds governing the sustainable state of an ecosystem; and (iv) identify cross-scale linkages between the HH/F and levels above it. Our model also has significant implications for policy and management, suggesting that:(i) strategies to address land degradation should aim to increase system resilience and improve adaptive capacity;(ii) restoration efforts and interventions should occur before a system has crossed key biophysical or socioeconomic thresholds; otherwise, they require progressively higher levels of outside intervention;(iii) the distribution of outside resources should be where they will have the greatest impact in terms of long-term, sustained production;(iv) a wider use of adaptive management and participatory approaches should be used in dealing with attribution issues; and (v) conditions conducive to institutional \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:-gKCQx66J1MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1623907325281146607&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
