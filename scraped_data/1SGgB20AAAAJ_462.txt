Since climates do not favor high-input agriculture, production depends on the functioning of soilvegetation systems with relatively little support from fossil fuels or chemicals. People, livestock, and landscape processes are thus tightly interconnected. Their mutual welfare is subject to the influence of four main external drivers\u2014climate, land alienation by immigrants, livestock prices, and regional investment. The proportion of rangeland contribution to GDP has been declining steadily in all developed countries for the past hundred years (Walker 1995), and, for most landowners, so have the terms of trade for livestock production. In developing countries, increases in the numbers of humans and stock, and encroachment on rangelands by farmers, have reduced pastoral mobility and increased dependency on drought relief. In general, the political influence of rangeland peoples declined during the twentieth century. Access to and management of land are thus often influenced strongly by policies and institutions established in remote cities. These often detract from the resilience of rangeland regions. What follows in this chapter is based on our experience and on rangelands literature, supplemented by insights gained from four regional case studies carried out for the Resilience Network, by researchers from those regions. A comparative analysis will be published shortly. The regions are: the Western Division of New South Wales, Australia; the Great Plains of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mBW8BwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA293&dq=info:idZh3dyAX-wJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9MsYBw9zUs&sig=0Ef3RxjyRjTj27Y3d-IunMP8-c8", "cites_per_year": {}}
