A special focus is on conditions for a successful adaptation to emerging crises. Behavioral patterns, incentives, and stakes of actors are described in a modeling framework, from which possible consequences are derived and, on a subsequent stage, confronted with dates from field studies and experiments. We intend to make a theory-based, empirically founded assessment of possible and probable successful cooperations under alternative institutional settings for an arbitrary collection of common pool resources.\" At the heart of our research project lies the investigation of typical institutions designed to handle conflicts occurring in the use of a common property resource by a group of individuals. On this field, it is planned to carry out and administer theoretical and practical investigations. For the sake of formal analysis, we will produce mainly game-theoretic works, which are to provide the type of conflict, the potential for conflict, and theoretical solutions. Field studies shall serve as a means to observe actual processes as well as behaviorally relevant cognitions; on the other hand, the assessment of alternatives to handle the relevant common pool resource of different users. In order to control for typical patterns of cooperation as well as barriers to cooperations mainly in situations of a crisis, several experiments will be carried out, with conditions for administration and the use of different investigation devices being varied systematically.\" The general targets of the project are obvious from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:qoKP6G9emhYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/3820", "cites_per_year": {}}
