Its ongoing development requires that resilience theory be confronted with case studies to assess its capacity to help understand and develop policy for SESs. This paper synthesizes the findings from several papers in the special feature \u201cExploring Resilience in Social-Ecological Systems\u201d that do just this. It then highlights key challenges facing resilience as a theory for understanding SESs and provides some avenues for future research."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 453, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16351370867674685162", "cites_id": ["16351370867674685162"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26267809", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6p5rviu96-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 17, "2008": 21, "2009": 21, "2010": 28, "2011": 40, "2012": 41, "2013": 32, "2014": 44, "2015": 39, "2016": 30, "2017": 22, "2018": 27, "2019": 26, "2020": 11, "2021": 22, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
