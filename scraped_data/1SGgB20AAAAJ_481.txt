Each section is divided for easy reference and covers identification, effects, costs, marketing and legal issues. All substances from the familiar to the less prevalent are included and presented in a way which helps to challenge the mystique of this subject often maintained by specialist workers. Part 2 looks at the issues underpinning drug use and, through a number of short scenarios, explores treatment models and options including harm minimisation, detoxification and residential rehabilitation.The authors have covered a broad range of information and issues which reflects their own knowledge and experience from two very different backgrounds, policing and outreach work. There still remains a huge gap between the'law'and the'streets' \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:OeO3PiPA3c0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/probj43&section=80", "cites_per_year": {}}
