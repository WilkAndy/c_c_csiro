He almost chose geology at the start of his career and ecology would have been less of a science without him. Despite an impressive array of achievements and contributions, Graeme's death in February 1994 at the rel-atively young age of 57 leaves a sense that we have been prematurely deprived of his ecological acumen, integrity, and trenchant writing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:zAyHUgvcU_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7357630007382289179&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
