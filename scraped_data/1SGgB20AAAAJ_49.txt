The editors present a summary of the integrated and interactive effects of global change on the terrestrial biosphere for four key regions of the world, as well as a projection of future trends in the terrestrial component of the global carbon cycle. The book also includes a section on tools developed or modified for global change research."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 426, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5620765212902371742,8101635762532816092,10311864020085478389,16603644115348697465", "cites_id": ["5620765212902371742", "8101635762532816092", "10311864020085478389", "16603644115348697465"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=e7g21URRcQ0C&oi=fnd&pg=PP14&dq=info:njHrWC74AE4J:scholar.google.com&ots=GNhGkwXQwp&sig=jFvxmuZrzBF260rg3pdimxpu4yE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:njHrWC74AE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 15, "2000": 29, "2001": 30, "2002": 29, "2003": 29, "2004": 23, "2005": 25, "2006": 24, "2007": 21, "2008": 20, "2009": 25, "2010": 21, "2011": 18, "2012": 17, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 14, "2020": 9, "2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
