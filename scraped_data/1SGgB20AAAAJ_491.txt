The capability of high performance liquid chromatography connected in series to an ultraviolet detector and mass spectrometer (HPLC-UV-MS) to identify and characterise organic impurities has been assessed. Organic impurities were separated on an HPLC column and then detected, and in some cases identified, using a UV absorption detector and mass spectrometer (MS). Numerous organic impurities were separated while the run time for analysis was less than 60 min. As a result of this work, chemical structures of eight organic impuritics present in raw sugar were tentatively identified."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:W-zclTkWZekC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2080667913373701463&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V1UxgHEE4BwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
