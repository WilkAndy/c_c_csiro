Here the method of extracting harmful fume and smoke, both at source and from the working environment in general is covered. Another article focuses on the provision of the correct personal protection equipment for the job and the trap of trying to economise by using inadequate attire. The danger associated with UV radiation from the welding arc, which although invisible to the naked eye is the real culprit behind \"arc eye,\" is highlighted. More general topics such as adequate lighting and the problems of back strain and musculo-skeletal disease, brought about by bad lifting practices, are also presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:z-xpeKpFZ3wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15192503080109213669&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
