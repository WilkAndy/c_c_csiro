Four of them (correlative, plant eco-physiological, functional type dominance, and the gap-phase or plant-by-plant replacement models) are based either on some typology of vegetation or on species composition. Osing them for climate feed-back effects requires an intermediate step to transform vegetation type into a set of functional attributes (albedo, etc). The fifth approach is to directly model the functional attributes, using vegetation structure as the main predictor. The various approaches need to be brought together in a dynamic global vegetation model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10812573705499463986&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MlEGaH_6DZYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
