Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system\u2019s dynamics. Three related attributes of social\u2013ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components\u2014latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy\u2014most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 8898, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14255867793166764396", "cites_id": ["14255867793166764396"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26267673", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bAmjIDoE18UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 22, "2006": 65, "2007": 106, "2008": 122, "2009": 149, "2010": 245, "2011": 277, "2012": 382, "2013": 456, "2014": 553, "2015": 640, "2016": 679, "2017": 750, "2018": 843, "2019": 770, "2020": 767, "2021": 876, "2022": 787, "2023": 278}}
