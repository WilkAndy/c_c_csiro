The workshop was part of the IUBS Decade 01 the Tropics programme on Responses of Savannas to Stress and Disturbance, and the authors were requested to produce accounts of the four major determinants of savannas-water, nutrients, fire and herbivory. The exclusion 01 Man as a determinant was deliberate, since the intention was to first obtain an understanding 01 the inherent structure and function of savannas, and then to undertake research which would provide a predictive understanding 01 the ways in wh ich savannas respond to the combination 01 natural variation in these four determinants, and the added effects of Man.Previous books on savannas (Bourliere, 1983; Huntley and Walker, 1982; TothilI and Mott, 1985) have been comprehensive in their treatment of savanna ecology. This book locuses on the major determinants and was intended to set the scene for the forthcoming decade 01 research into the world's savannas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:sBSA6aAHrTwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ernesto-Medina/publication/289704634_Determinants_of_Tropical_Savannas/links/57483cdc08ae707fe21fb815/Determinants-of-Tropical-Savannas.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QvvBu8ES_CkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
