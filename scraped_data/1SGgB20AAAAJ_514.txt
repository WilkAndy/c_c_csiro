Seed Production of Stylosanthes Cultivars in Australia 435 production rose from an estimated 40 t in 1963 to a peak of about 250 t in 1967 (T. Stockwell, pers. comm.). In Queensland recorded production peaked at 160 t in 1970. Most of the seed was of the common type, and the three cultivars Lawson, Gordon and Paterson reached peaks of only 22, 11 and 1 t respectively. In Western Australia substantial amounts of common TS were harvested in the north of the state.Market saturation caused seed production to decline during the early 1970s, but large quantities of seed continued to be marketed until 1974. Then two coincident events brought production almost to a halt. One was the arrival of anthracnose (Lenn\u00e9 and Calder\u00f3n, this volume) which devastated TS seed crops for the first time during the protracted wet season of 1973-74. The other was the collapse of beef cattle prices, which placed the purchase of seed out of the reach of most northern Australian cattlemen for several years. Since that time TS has been a seed crop of little consequence with less than about 8 t of seed produced annually (BA Woodbridge, pers. comm.)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:w8fV-8NuKYgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2890563261614261601&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YQVQufhXHSgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
