Their relevance to wildlife reserves with regard to culling decisions is explained. Five determinants of stability and resilience are described:(i) system size\u2013increased area increases stability and the number of species contained up to a certain limit;(ii) spatial variability\u2013increased habitat diversity increases stability;(iii) temporal variation-fluctuating species populations increase resilience, but may cause the system to cross a stability boundary;(iv) key factors\u2013if these are resistant to change, both high stability and high resilience are conferred; and (v) ecological complexity-greater compartmentalization reduces population fluctuations. The need for the development of a reliable set of wildlife management principles and for the adoption of a programme of active adaptive management to develop these principles is emphasized. We conclude that, unless the understanding of processes at the ecosystem level is actively pursued, wildlife management will remain in the realm of\" cautious fiddling\"."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:wkmAz21iQ3gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15444764439874382267&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uylMnm3TVtYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
