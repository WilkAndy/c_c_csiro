A synthesis of the past six years' activities of the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems project of the IGBP (International Geosphere\u2013Biosphere Programme) deals with global change effects as ecosystem responses and living with global change. Ecosystem responses are considered in terms of changes in function and vegetation composition/structure. Field experiments of elevated CO\u2082 effects on aboveground biomass show, on average, a positive effect on biomass, ranging from \u221220% to +80%. Some early predictions of CO\u2082 effects (C\u2083 vs. C\u2084 plants, N\u2013fixers, C:N in litter) are not generally supported, and it is necessary to consider the interactive effects of changes in CO\u2082, temperature, and nitrogen.
