One of the most pressing challenges facing humanity is the sustainability of important ecological, social and cultural processes in the face of changes in the forces that shape ecosystems and regions. Unprecedented directional changes in climate, human population, technology and social and economic institutions alter the structure and functioning of current ecological and social systems. The Sustainability Science Award recognizes the role that science can contribute to addressing these challenges. This is the first year that the award is being given, and it will continue to be given annually."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:q8yTKY340rsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.esa.org/history_old/Awards/bulletin/sustain2004.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
