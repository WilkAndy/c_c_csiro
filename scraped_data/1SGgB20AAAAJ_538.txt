Local and regional drivers with repercussions at a global level generate major, intertwined global-scale challenges like climate disorder, ocean acidification, decliningfisheries, emerging diseases, antibiotic resistance or crises in energy, food, and water. The current development of human society fails to adequately address systemic environmental change and might transgress planetary boundaries in a way that fundamentally affects human well-being. These activities where environmental and social changes interact, creating unexpected links and feedbacks, are very likely to result in nonlinear, and perhaps, irreversible shifts in the behavior of the planetary system.Such alterations cause at minimum concern about future human well-being, and in the worst cases challenge the survival of our species. In addition, institutions and human decisionmaking are embedded in social-ecological interactions across scales, which sometimes generate destructive feedbacks and traps and other times contribute to transformations towards more adaptive modes of governance of social-ecological systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://beijer.kva.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3709424_Disc-228_new.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
