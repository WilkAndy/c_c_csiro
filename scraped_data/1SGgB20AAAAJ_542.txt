Some ecological systems display several possible stable states. They may also show a hysteresis effect in which, even after a long time, the state of the system may be partly determined by its history. The concept of resilience depends upon our objectives, the types of disturbances that we anticipate, control measures that are available, and the time scale of interest."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6497575419737833696&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4IDIKmsGLFoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
