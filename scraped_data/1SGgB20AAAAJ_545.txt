The first is a general paper on resilience, that includes rangelands, and describes what resilience is and how it applies in two detailed examples-lakes and rangelands. It emphasizes the need to consider resilience of what to what. The Walker and Janssen (2002) paper considers the rangeland ecosystem and the managers as a complex adaptive system. It explores the outcomes of management and policy strategies using an agent based model and an optimisation approach using a genetic algorithm. Finally, the paper by Anderies et al (2002) provides a detailed account of a model of resilience dynamics in the grassland component of a savanna rangeland. What follows are some of the insights that emerge from the three papers plus some general observations arising from work on resilience.Multiple states in ecosystems are common.
