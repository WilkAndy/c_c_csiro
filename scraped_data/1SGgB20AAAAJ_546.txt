This has led to community concern for the gradual irrecoverable loss of values associated with less intensive land uses; in particular concern for the availability and functional capacity of the BEMWA resources-biodiversity, earth materials, water and air. Concern extends to the functionality of these resources in industrial, amenity and service roles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://dougcocks.labshop.com.au/SUSTAINABILITYPAPER.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H8VaGhS_EaUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
