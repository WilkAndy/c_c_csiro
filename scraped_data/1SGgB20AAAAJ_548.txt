Resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and re-organize so as to retain essentially the same function, structure and feedbacks\u2013to have the same identity (remain in the same system regime). Adaptability is the capacity to manage resilience. It can be done in two ways:(i) change the positions of thresholds between alternate regimes of the system,(ii) control the trajectory of the system\u2013avoid crossing a threshold (or engineer such a crossing). Transformability is the capacity to become a fundamentally different system when ecological, social and/or economic conditions make the existing system untenable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Okey/publication/233858845_Predicting_marine_ecosystem_impacts_of_climate_change_in_Australia/links/09e4150c79adb88179000000/Predicting-marine-ecosystem-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Australia.pdf#page=84", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:at2yEbGReVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
