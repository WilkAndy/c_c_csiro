Three main sources of confusion are unclear definition of the system, unclear definition of the role of people, and confusion between variables and drivers. As a contribution to resolving some of the confusion, we offer one interpretation of how the terms might be used."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 326, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18055630813154192476", "cites_id": ["18055630813154192476"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26269094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XCynzY98kvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 13, "2015": 18, "2016": 32, "2017": 59, "2018": 36, "2019": 38, "2020": 45, "2021": 29, "2022": 29, "2023": 12}}
