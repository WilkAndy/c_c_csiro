Average specific leaf area (SLA, m2 kg-1) of leaves ranged from 10.7 \u00b1 1.7 (av. \u00b1 s.d.) in N2 fixing deciduous trees to 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 in spinescent sclerophylls shrubs. SLA generally decreased with increasing aridity. N2 fixing species had higher leaf N concentration (average N-concentration 20.1 \u00b1 3.7 mgN g-1) than non- N2 fixing (10.8 \u00b1 3.3) or spinescent species (7.05 \u00b1 1.8). Community-averaged \u0394 was approximately constant at rainfalls above 475 mm (average \u0394 = 19.4 \u00b1 1.2\u2030). Where rainfall was less than 475 mm, \u0394 decreased from 19\u2030 to 17\u2030 at 220 mm. \u0394 was positively correlated with SLA. \u0394 of deciduous N2 fixing species and spinescent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 319, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10982754892576927274", "cites_id": ["10982754892576927274"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/pp97113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ki47u2KVapgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 6, "2000": 8, "2001": 11, "2002": 13, "2003": 14, "2004": 13, "2005": 13, "2006": 16, "2007": 7, "2008": 20, "2009": 18, "2010": 19, "2011": 23, "2012": 12, "2013": 18, "2014": 17, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
