Different lines of evidence indicate that regime shifts occur when the climate or biosphere transgresses a tipping point. Whether human activities will trigger such a global event in the near future is uncertain, due to critical knowledge gaps. In particular, we lack understanding of how regime shifts propagate across scales, and whether local or regional tipping points can lead to global transitions. The ongoing disruption of ecosystems and climate, combined with unprecedented breakdown of isolation by human migration and trade, highlights the need to operate within safe planetary boundaries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 308, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4181975606181689043", "cites_id": ["4181975606181689043"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534713001419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0_bOIahcCToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 20, "2015": 41, "2016": 27, "2017": 23, "2018": 34, "2019": 35, "2020": 41, "2021": 36, "2022": 32, "2023": 13}}
