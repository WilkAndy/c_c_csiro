These were nil utilization, light utilization by wild herbivores, moderate utilization by cattle and intensive utilization by cattle and goats. Total above-ground standing crop of shrubs and trees varied between 31 t ha-1 (nil utilization) and 9 t ha-1 (intensive utilization). The seasonal production of new leaves and twigs varied from 2 t ha-1 (nil utilization) to 0.6 t ha-1 (intensive utilization). Most of the differences in the herbaceous vegetation attributable to utilization were a result of the intensity of use rather than the different species of herbivores involved. It was dominated by annual grasses in intensively utilized areas and by perennial grasses in areas of light and moderate utilization. The areas dominated by annual grasses were characterized by large fluctuations in above \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 308, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1141661304227509301", "cites_id": ["1141661304227509301"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2258773", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NTRKTOj-1w8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 8, "1986": 8, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 5, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 8, "1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 4, "1996": 6, "1997": 12, "1998": 3, "1999": 13, "2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 10, "2003": 16, "2004": 13, "2005": 10, "2006": 9, "2007": 10, "2008": 11, "2009": 8, "2010": 10, "2011": 10, "2012": 16, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 11, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
