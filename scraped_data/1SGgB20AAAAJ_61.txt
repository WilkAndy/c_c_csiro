(2) Herbivore mortality occurred during the second year of the drought, when failure of the spring rains coincided with depleted food reserves. It was severe in Klaserie, with up to 90% mortality. In Tuli, mortality was high but restricted mostly to wildebeest and zebra; impala (a mixed grazer-browser) and browsers were little affected. Mortality was up to 35% in Kruger; it included browsers, but wildebeest and zebra were little affected. Mortality was low in Umfolozi, even in an unculled block, although pre-emptive culling exceeded the average mortalities at Kruger. Ungulate populations recovered to predrought levels within 2 years in Kruger but, apart from impala, will take longer in the more severely affected areas. (3) Mortality of grass tufts was extensive in Klaserie \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 262, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2438930137249794575", "cites_id": ["2438930137249794575"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2403882", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D8rErgnS2CEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 8, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 8, "2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 3, "2007": 11, "2008": 17, "2009": 6, "2010": 12, "2011": 5, "2012": 17, "2013": 10, "2014": 12, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 17, "2018": 10, "2019": 19, "2020": 14, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
