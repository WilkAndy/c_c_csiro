The objectives of GCTE are: to predict the effects of changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and land use on terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural and production forest systems; and to determine how these effects lead to feedbacks to the atmosphere and the physical climate system. The research plan has four foci: ecosystem physiology, change in ecosystem structure, global change impact on agriculture and forestry; and global change and ecological complexity. The research strategy is outlined. 17 refs., 6 figs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 242, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1096395174674840702", "cites_id": ["1096395174674840702"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/6183524", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fjzyN5otNw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 9, "1994": 9, "1995": 22, "1996": 19, "1997": 12, "1998": 11, "1999": 12, "2000": 11, "2001": 14, "2002": 9, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 8, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 11, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
