A conceptual framework identifies this pattern\u2019s deep causes, intermediate processes, and ultimate outcomes. The framework shows how multiple stresses can interact within a single social-ecological system to cause a shift in that system\u2019s behavior, how simultaneous shifts of this kind in several largely discrete social-ecological systems can interact to cause a far larger intersystemic crisis, and how such a larger crisis can then rapidly propagate across multiple system boundaries to the global scale. Case studies of the 2008-2009 financial-energy and food-energy crises illustrate the framework. Suggestions are offered for future research to explore further the framework\u2019s propositions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11826518959086493559", "cites_id": ["11826518959086493559"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26270255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d9_FbVU8IKQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 6, "2016": 12, "2017": 26, "2018": 33, "2019": 28, "2020": 29, "2021": 41, "2022": 26, "2023": 10}}
