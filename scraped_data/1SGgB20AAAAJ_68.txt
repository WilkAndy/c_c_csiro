It is based on a set of permanently located transects of       variable size, distributed so as to cover the variation within previously determined habitat types. The assessment procedure is designed to minimize errors associated with subjective estimates       and personal bias, and includes measurements wherever these are not unduly laborious or time consuming. Recording is carried out using six printed forms, four of which are designed for       automatic data processing. The actual categories and definitions of use or damage on the forms may be changed to suit the needs of the particular monitoring programme. The computer programmes       have been tested on two sets of data, using all the options (e.g. mature trees only vs. all trees) and are hopefully bug-free.
