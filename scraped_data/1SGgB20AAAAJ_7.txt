Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 8070, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=740639968276293128", "cites_id": ["740639968276293128"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/35098000", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CKaQhyBIRwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 67, "2003": 140, "2004": 174, "2005": 189, "2006": 225, "2007": 249, "2008": 287, "2009": 316, "2010": 383, "2011": 390, "2012": 421, "2013": 483, "2014": 464, "2015": 483, "2016": 497, "2017": 458, "2018": 547, "2019": 537, "2020": 458, "2021": 556, "2022": 443, "2023": 184}}
