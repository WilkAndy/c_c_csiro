Even though the two are related, they have usually been discussed separately in popular writings. This has had unfortunate consequences. Writings on the sustainability of the food supply have often encouraged readers to adopt an all-or-nothing position (predicting a rosy or a catastrophic future), which has drawn attention from the economic misery endemic in large parts of the world. On the other hand, writings on the adequacy of the world's food supply frequently conclude with the truism that the nearly 1 billion people in poor countries who go to bed hungry each night do so because they are extremely poor.
