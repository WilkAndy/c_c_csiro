This research explores whether the provision of community benefits associates with increased local support for a hypothetical, future offshore wind farm in Exmouth (UK), using an experimental methodology (n = 311). Participants were allocated to one of three framing conditions: (i) a \u2018no-framed condition\u2019, presenting basic information about a possible wind farm without mentioning community benefits; (ii) a \u2018community benefit frame\u2019, highlighting the likely community benefits that would accompany a wind farm; or (iii) a \u2018dual framing\u2019 condition, presenting information about community benefits alongside critical perspectives that commonly surround these (perceptions of \u2018bribery\u2019). Support for the development was greatest under the community \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 196, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18368067724037203986", "cites_id": ["18368067724037203986"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000814", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EiiO3UZ86P4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 22, "2016": 21, "2017": 21, "2018": 22, "2019": 26, "2020": 30, "2021": 14, "2022": 24, "2023": 9}}
