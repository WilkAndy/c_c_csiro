The resilience of the system (the state of the range in this example) may be influenced by the management regime through its impact on the response to disturbances. The paper shows that optimal management of an event-driven system should be sensitive to the opportunities created by such events."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11909181057175528391", "cites_id": ["11909181057175528391"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180099700565X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xyPC7hLpRaUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 10, "2003": 8, "2004": 11, "2005": 12, "2006": 9, "2007": 11, "2008": 10, "2009": 12, "2010": 16, "2011": 13, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
