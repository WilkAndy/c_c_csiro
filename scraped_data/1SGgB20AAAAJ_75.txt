Two interdependent phases, bands of dense and sparse vegetation, alternate in the landscape. This volume synthesizes half a centurys accumulated knowledge of both theoretical and applied landscape functions from a variety of these regions. It covers structure, dynamics, and methods of study, as well as disturbances to these landscapes and relevant management issues. Chapters are included to discuss the role of modeling in answering questions about the origins and complex processes of banded landscapes. Studies of banded landscapes have yielded valuable lessons for understanding other semi-arid landscapes as well, leading to a knowledge base facilitating sustainable use and rehabilitation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C", "num_citations": 185, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4089898578596284738,5368889433355787727", "cites_id": ["4089898578596284738", "5368889433355787727"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mSNkNsKxCZkC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:QkmbiBY9wjgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=iGCDjtGiJ3&sig=7ZGA6YmpDBhpP7pXD9t7RnTz2xE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QkmbiBY9wjgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 12, "2006": 17, "2007": 6, "2008": 10, "2009": 13, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 12, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 10, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
