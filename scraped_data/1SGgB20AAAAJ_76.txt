The chapters bring together the early results of an international scientific research program designed to address what will happen to our ability to produce food and fiber, and what effects there will be on biological diversity under rapid environmental change. This book addresses how these changes to terrestrial ecosystems will feed back to further environmental change. International in scope, this state-of-the-art assessment will interest policymakers, students and scientists interested in global change, climate change and biodiversity. Special features include descriptions of a dynamic global vegetation model, developing generic crop models and a special section on the emerging discipline of global ecology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 183, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8318360209665317296,9556595261006990163", "cites_id": ["8318360209665317296", "9556595261006990163"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oWgKuI5Du78C&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=info:sFnYwonAcHMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=JPCcz_-FTh&sig=a0xgVG1jxnIhsNDwvQ4MOu75-LQ", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sFnYwonAcHMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 15, "2000": 17, "2001": 7, "2002": 9, "2003": 4, "2004": 7, "2005": 12, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
