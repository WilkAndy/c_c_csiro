When the livestock are grazers (only or preferentially eating grass) the desirable state of the system is dominated by grass, with scattered trees and shrubs. However, the system can have multiple stable attractors and a perturbation such as a drought can cause it to move from such a desired configuration into one that is dominated by shrubs with very little grass. In this paper, using the rangelands of New South Wales in Australia as an example, we provide a methodology to find robust management strategies in the context of this complex ecological system driven by stochastic rainfall events. The control variables are sheep density and the degree of fire suppression. By comparing the optimal solution where it is assumed the manager has perfect knowledge and foresight of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 181, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9612374707150774427", "cites_id": ["9612374707150774427"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506960300069X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m-CrG94DZoUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 10, "2006": 11, "2007": 20, "2008": 9, "2009": 14, "2010": 11, "2011": 18, "2012": 13, "2013": 12, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
