We incorporate an estimate of resilience in IW by taking account of known or suspected thresholds that can lead to irreversible (or practically irreversible) changes in the productivity and value of assets and hence social welfare. These thresholds allow us to identify policies or projects that may be leading to an increased risk of decline in capital stocks (the wealth of the region). Such risks are not reflected through usual measures of current system performance, e.g. agricultural production. We use the Goulburn-Broken Catchment in south-eastern Australia as a case study to explore the significance and practicality of including resilience in inclusive wealth estimates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8853591738419004410", "cites_id": ["8853591738419004410"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-009-9311-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-kPMGsdG3noJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 13, "2012": 6, "2013": 15, "2014": 17, "2015": 4, "2016": 21, "2017": 14, "2018": 18, "2019": 15, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
