The response from most quarters has been for\" more of the same\" that created the situation in the first place: more control, more intensification, and greater efficiency.\" Resilience thinking\" offers a different way of understanding the world and a new approach to managing resources. It embraces human and natural systems as complex entities continually adapting through cycles of change, and seeks to understand the qualities of a system that must be maintained or enhanced in order to achieve sustainability. It explains why greater efficiency by itself cannot solve resource problems and offers a constructive alternative that opens up options rather than closing them down. In Resilience Thinking, scientist Brian Walker and science writer David Salt present an accessible introduction to the emerging paradigm of resilience. The book arose out of appeals from colleagues in science and industry for a plainly written account of what resilience is all about and how a resilience approach differs from current practices. Rather than complicated theory, the book offers a conceptual overview along with five case studies of resilience thinking in the real world. It is an engaging and important work for anyone interested in managing risk in a complex world."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 5403, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7127696085675357075", "cites_id": ["7127696085675357075"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NFqFbXYbjLEC&oi=fnd&pg=PR1&dq=info:kzOfZdOp6mIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=6pP0TC1VJa&sig=nQlyuZFks0Z7TwAkb278-kGVEOQ", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kzOfZdOp6mIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 35, "2008": 79, "2009": 151, "2010": 213, "2011": 248, "2012": 343, "2013": 378, "2014": 391, "2015": 479, "2016": 419, "2017": 451, "2018": 483, "2019": 402, "2020": 396, "2021": 364, "2022": 347, "2023": 107}}
