The transects (\u2248 1000 km) will be located along existing environmental and land use intensity gradients that span transitions between biomes in regions likely to be widely affected by forcing from components of global change or where the impacts of global change are likely to feed back to affect atmospheric, climatic, or hydrologic systems. Experimental studies on the transects will examine short-term changes in ecosystem function and biosphere-atmosphere interaction in response to variation in primary controlling variables. A hierarchy of modeling approaches will develop predictions of long-term \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15971542983483638546", "cites_id": ["15971542983483638546"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00044672", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EsNs_bhRpt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 4, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 12, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 12, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
