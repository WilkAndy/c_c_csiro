Later, Aldo Leopold proposed the concept of habitat management as superior to population management, and more recently, ecosystem management, whereby ecological processes are conserved or mimicked, has come into favour. Managing for resilience builds upon these roots, and focuses on maintaining key processes and relationships in social\u2010ecological systems so that they are robust to a great variety of external or internal perturbations at a range of ecological and social scales. Managing for resilience focuses on system\u2010level characteristics and processes, and the endurance of system properties in the face of social or ecological surprise. Managing for resilience consists of actively maintaining a diversity of functions and homeostatic feedbacks, steering systems away from thresholds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5117172149922562756", "cites_id": ["5117172149922562756"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2981/10-084", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xAKoWvXYA0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 17, "2017": 16, "2018": 14, "2019": 13, "2020": 5, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
