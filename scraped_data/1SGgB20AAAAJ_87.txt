It was replaced by a notion, in the developing world especially, that poverty reduction and environmental protection should be tackled in an integrated manner (Adams 1990). Several approaches emerged, building on early attempts that can be traced back to the 1960s (Garnett et al. 2007). The promotion of commercial nontimber forest product (NTFP) production is one of those approaches (Kusters et al. 2006). At the landscape level, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) gained favor.Integrated approaches appear to be at a crossroad (Adams et al. 2004, Sayer and Campbell 2004, Agrawal and Redford 2006). There are landscapes with vast natural assets where the local people remain deep in poverty (Fisher and Christopher 2007). This is well illustrated by the Malinau District in Kalimantan \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13186292960314690401", "cites_id": ["13186292960314690401"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26268120", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YYvKW5Uf_7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 14, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
