Direct and indirect feedbacks link terrestrial ecosystems with global change, and include interactions affecting fluxes of water, energy, nutrients, and \"greenhouse\" gases and affecting ecosystem structure and composition. Community development can affect ecosystem dynamics by altering resource partitioning among biotic components and through changes in structural characteristics, thereby affecting feedbacks to global change. The response of terrestrial ecosystems to the climate\u2014weather system is dependent on the spatial scale of the interactions between these systems and the temporal scale that links the various components.
