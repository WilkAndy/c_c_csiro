Three aspects are central: resilience, adaptability and transformability. These aspects interrelate across multiple scales. Resilience in this context is the capacity of a SES to continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds. Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 4850, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5574526836129023183", "cites_id": ["5574526836129023183"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26268226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z0RaUp-yXE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 42, "2012": 105, "2013": 181, "2014": 256, "2015": 353, "2016": 376, "2017": 418, "2018": 516, "2019": 543, "2020": 544, "2021": 633, "2022": 602, "2023": 202}}
