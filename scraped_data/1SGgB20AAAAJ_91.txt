Ordination of the data showed that the types which occupy the ends of the major (soil-type) gradient are easily distinguishable, viz. well developed, mature Baikiaea plurijuga woodlands on deep sands, and scrub Terminalia sericea and mixed woodland on soils with a higher clay content or compact layer. The central groups of stands, involving mixed woodlands and scrub, were less easy to interpret, and previous logging disturbance is involved.In the disturbed Baikiaea woodlands recruitment appears to be less than is required for long-term maintenance, even given that some of the measurements may have led to underestimates. Elephants were shown to have only a minor effect, and are relatively insignificant as agents of change in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6706368160226907269", "cites_id": ["6706368160226907269"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00044841", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hZRQU0_OEV0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 9, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
