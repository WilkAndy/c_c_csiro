Canberra Csiro", "volume": "2015", "abstract": "The concepts of \u2018resilience\u2019,\u2018adaptation\u2019, and \u2018transformation\u2019have captured the attention of those who influence the global discourse on sustainability and the future of the planet and its people. The global policy arena has embraced the concepts and language of resilience thinking, planetary boundaries and a \u2018safe operating space for humanity\u2019(Rockstrom et al., 2009b), adaptation and adaptive governance and management. The language permeates new policy directions, exemplified in the report The future we want (UN, 2012b) which aims to guide the formulation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the post-2015 development agenda. They are also prominent in Resilient People, Resilient Planet (UN, 2012a) which recognized that, in order to deal with the global food security crisis, the land production base needs to remain within the \u2018safe operating zone\u2019.Thus, these contemporary science approaches are gaining traction, and being translated into aspirational goals (O\u2019Connell et al., 2013). There are some outstanding challenges, however, in taking the concepts beyond the stage of research and case-specific studies. Further effort is required to operationalize the concepts in the broader global policy and management domains, and for on-theground decision-making, planning and investment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16311219409972720486", "cites_id": ["16311219409972720486"], "pub_url": "https://www.stapgef.org/sites/default/files/documents/CSIRO-STAP-Resilience-Adaptation-Transformation-Assessment-Framework-Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZnPhAKIXXeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 15, "2018": 20, "2019": 11, "2020": 18, "2021": 17, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
