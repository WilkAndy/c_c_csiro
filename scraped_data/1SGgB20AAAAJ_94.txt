International Livestock \u2026, 1980", "author": "BH Walker", "pages": "7-24", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to present a review of the aboveground biomass and nutritive value of browse in southern Africa, and its role in livestock production. The coverage is necessarily limited, firstly because a detailed account of all the different vegetation types is simply too vast and, secondly, because for some regions the data are not available. The review is therefore a selected coverage, restricted to those types and species deemed to be important either because they are very abundant or because they are palatable and valuable as a food source. The area covered (Figure 1) includes South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, South-West Africa (Namibia), Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The map of the vegetation types distinguished for this review is derived from several sources, but chiefly from Acocks (1975) and Wild and Grandvaux-Barbosa (1967)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12546260250751562107", "cites_id": ["12546260250751562107"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=f8wzMTZzPZYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA7&dq=info:e3GmoTlFHa4J:scholar.google.com&ots=OtE3SIeq-X&sig=rzXndrlQ44rQlvh5jDRffD49n7o", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e3GmoTlFHa4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 6, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
