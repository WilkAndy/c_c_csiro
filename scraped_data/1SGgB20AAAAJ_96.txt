Our discussion will be couched in terms of a contrast between two models which we call the \u2018range succession model\u2019and the \u2018state-and-transition model\u2019. The range succession model supposes a given rangeland has a single persistent state (the climax) in the absence of grazing. Succession towards this climax is a steady process. Grazing pressure produces changes which are also progressive and are in the opposite direction to the successional tendency. Therefore the grazing pressure can be made equal and opposite to the successional tendency, producing an equilibrium in the vegetation at a set stocking rate (Fig. 1). A sustainable yield of livestock products can be harvested from such an equilibrium. All possible states of the vegetation can be arrayed on a single continuum, from heavily-grazed, early-successional, poor condition, to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16584999461276265881", "cites_id": ["16584999461276265881"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140196318309108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ma1qkSPBKeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 6, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 7, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 6, "2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
