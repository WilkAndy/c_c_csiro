The biophysical components include: (i) the reduction and recovery of potential primary production, reflected as changes in grass production per unit of rainfall; (ii) changes in woody plants dependent on the grazing and fire regimes; and (iii) livestock and wool dynamics influenced by season, condition of the rangeland and numbers of wild and feral animals. The social components include the managers, who vary with regard to a range of cognitive abilities and lifestyle choices, and the regulators who vary in regard to policy goals.We compare agent\u2013based and optimization models of a rangeland system. The agent\u2013based model leads to recognition that policies select for certain management practices by creating a template that governs the trajectories of the behaviour of individuals, learning, and overall system dynamics \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "1SGgB20AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11585494214867352089", "cites_id": ["11585494214867352089"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2001.0984", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GfqCGJvxx6AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
