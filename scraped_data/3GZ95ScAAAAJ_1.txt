Most species were represented by multiple specimens, and 754 sequences were generated. The GC content of the 143 species of teleosts was higher than the 61 species of sharks and rays (47.1% versus 42.2%), largely due to a higher GC content of codon position 3 in the former (41.1% versus 29.9%). Rays had higher GC than sharks (44.7% versus 41.0%), again largely due to higher GC in the 3rd codon position in the former (36.3% versus 26.8%). Average within-species, genus, family, order and class Kimura two parameter (K2P) distances were 0.39%, 9.93%, 15.46%, 22.18% and 23.27%, respectively. All species could be differentiated by their cox1 sequence, although single individuals of each of two species had haplotypes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 4589, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12518955100275499246", "cites_id": ["12518955100275499246"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2005.1716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7mD83lVDvK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 24, "2007": 73, "2008": 84, "2009": 110, "2010": 172, "2011": 233, "2012": 238, "2013": 265, "2014": 232, "2015": 285, "2016": 366, "2017": 327, "2018": 335, "2019": 350, "2020": 442, "2021": 413, "2022": 406, "2023": 193}}
