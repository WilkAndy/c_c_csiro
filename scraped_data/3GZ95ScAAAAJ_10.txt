Texts by Johnston (1883.91) and Lord and Scott (1924) are now of mainly historical interest. Fish and fisheries continue to represent a significant part of the life in Tasmania. The state is renowned for its inland recreational fishing and anglers and professionals alike derive benefit and income from marine resources. Activities in these fields are expanding together with academic and applied research efforts based in Tasmania. For many years students, researchers and those otherwise interested in our waters have not had a comprehensive book on Tasmanian fish. The present work more than adequately fills a needed role."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 225, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14790593919879431855", "cites_id": ["14790593919879431855"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14790593919879431855&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r0Z3Y86-Qs0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 5, "1987": 5, "1988": 6, "1989": 11, "1990": 7, "1991": 7, "1992": 4, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 9, "1998": 6, "1999": 12, "2000": 5, "2001": 10, "2002": 6, "2003": 10, "2004": 9, "2005": 6, "2006": 11, "2007": 9, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
