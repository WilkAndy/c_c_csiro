The new species is distinguished from its congeners by the values of several proportional measurements, the presence of oronasal pits, coloration, and several skeletal structures. The new species is similar to both Notoraja and Pavoraja (Subgenus A), but it is classified with Notoraja because the scapulocoracoid possesses an anterior bridge. Examination of a specimen of N. tobitukai indicated that only one character state separates Notoraja and Pavoraja (subgenus A), suggesting that Pavoraja (Subgenus A) forms a monophyletic group with Notoraja rather than with Pavoraja. However, reallocation of Pavoraja (subgenus A) is not recommended until the taxa are better known. Review of the clasper component rhipidion suggests that the structure found in Notoraja, Pavoraja \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15357305441062932842", "cites_id": ["15357305441062932842"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1446989", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:atG6oe4bINUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
