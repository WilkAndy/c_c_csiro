It occurs from Coral Bay (near North West Cape) south to Groper Bluff (west of Bremer Bay) in depths of 9\u2013106 m where it is caught as by-catch of local gillnet, longline, rock lobster and recreational fisheries. It is sympatric with two other commercial wobbegong species, Orectolobus maculatus and O. ornatus, but differs from these and other Indo-Pacific species in having the combination of a few unbranched dermal lobes, relatively tall dorsal fins, no warty tubercles on the back of adults, and dark brown corrugated saddles without white spots and blotches. Some details of its biology are also provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15628059896042888077", "cites_id": ["15628059896042888077"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/lastpr_x2006d.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jRsqqKwF4tgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
