Rhinobatos sainsburyi belongs to an unresolved supraspecific complex that includes the type of the genus, R. rhinobatos (Linnaeus), and at least 9 other species that occur in the Indo-Pacific. Rhinobatos sainsburyi differs from these species by a combination of morphometry, squamation and colour. Aptychotrema timorensis, a third valid member of an endemic Australian genus, differs from its congeners in morphometry, and in having a narrower snout apex, fewer caudal vertebrae, and white spots on its dorsal surface."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10712019112710683950", "cites_id": ["10712019112710683950"], "pub_url": "https://media.australian.museum/media/Uploads/Journals/17996/1415_complete.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Lr1Q2KC8qJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
