It is probably a medium-sized species (probably attaining ca. 1.5 m TL) because the largest known specimen, an immature male (ca. 1 m TL), has prolongated dorsal and caudal fins typical of adult wedgefishes. Rhynchobatus immaculatus is unique within the family in having a very high vertebral count (within the range of 165\u2013170 total free centra) and in lacking a dark pectoral marking. Other Rhynchobatus species occurring in Taiwanese seas appear to attain a larger adult size, possess a dark pectoral marking at least in young, and have lower vertebral counts (fewer than 161 total fee centra). Rhynchobatus yentinesis, which was described from a specimen taken nearby at Wenzhou, China, has not yet been attributed to a currently recognised species. However, based on the illustration of the holotype, which reveals a broad-snouted species with a dark pectoral spot, it is closest to either R. palpebratus or R. springeri."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12865097375985780904", "cites_id": ["12865097375985780904"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3752.1.11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qEhxuOYBirIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
