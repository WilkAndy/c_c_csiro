The Darwin Initiative supports unusual projects, which break'new ground'and would otherwise be very unlikely to receive financial support. Specific aims include raising awareness of biodiversity, involving local people, strengthening links between Britain and partner countries, and acting as a catalyst to generate resources for and interest in further projects. The proposal for the elasmobranch biodiversity project in Sabah arose from the discovery that local fishermen could describe several species of freshwater elasmobranchs not recorded in scientific literature, and in recognition of the largely unreported diversity of elasmobranchs entering coastal markets there. The project was therefore proposed in order to study, for the first time, the biodiversity, distribution and conservation needs of elasmobranchs in the region. In addition to taxonomic and biodiversity studies, it was intended to address the local socio-economic importance of elasmobranchs, the need for fisheries management, protected areas, and education of local people, and to provide the information required by decision-makers to advance elasmobranch conservation. The final international workshop (of which this is the Proceedings Volume) was intended to highlight freshwater and coastal elasmobranch conservation issues worldwide. The Sabah project was carried out in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries, with advice from WWF, and the participation of the Universiti Malaysia Sabah.
