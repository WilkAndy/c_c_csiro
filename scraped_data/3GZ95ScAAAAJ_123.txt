It appears to be a small species and may reach sexual maturity smaller than 100 mm SL. It is distinguished from all other members of the genus in having 23-25 anal fin-rays, 7-10 scales between the lateral line and the origin of the dorsal fin, and 23-28 predorsal scales.The pomfret genus Brama presently contains eight species of which four (B. caribbea Mead, B. dussumieri Cuvier, B. orcini Cuvier and B. myersi Mead) are distributed in tropical seas (Mead, 1972; Pavlov, 1991b). The species can be distinguished from each other by a combination of body shape, pectoral and anal-fin counts, and numbers of vertebrae (Mead, 1972; Pavlov, 1991b)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9294904296239450913", "cites_id": ["9294904296239450913"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jji1950/41/4/41_4_421/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Icua_jUi_oAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
