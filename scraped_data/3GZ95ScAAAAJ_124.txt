Recent studies have shown that Atherinason esox (Klunzinger 1872) comprises two distinct species. Further studies using electrophoretic techniques have also shown that these two species belong in a new genus rather than in the genus Atherinason. The new genus Kestratherina will therefore include K. esox and a new species, K. brevirostris. Electrophoresis has also shown that Atherinosoma is not a cohesive group, and the two species originally assigned to that genus, A. presbyteroides (Richardson 1843) and A. wallacei, Prince, Ivantsoff and Potter 1982, must be placed into a new genus, Leptatherina.seagrass detritus, phytoplankton, diatoms, bacteria, zooplankton, fatty acids, sterols, fatty alcohols."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1400485412749962964", "cites_id": ["1400485412749962964"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF9880385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1O4TFBCGbxMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
