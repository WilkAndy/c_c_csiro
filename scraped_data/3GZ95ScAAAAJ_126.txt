However, other recently accessed material, collected further south (Shark Bay, Western Australia) and east (Gove, Northern Territory), suggest that this species is more widespread. Like other members of the genus Neotrygon, it lives primarily on sandy substrates but often hides partly concealed beneath small coral bommies during the day. Its eyes are relatively more protrusible than its congeners enabling it to bury deeply in soft sediments with its eyes still exposed. The type specimens were speared in shallow water near the shore in close association with two congeners, N. leylandi and N. kuhlii, from which it differs in colour and morphology. Neotrygon ningalooensis and N. leylandi both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12482960583007031606", "cites_id": ["12482960583007031606"], "pub_url": "https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA322782142&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=09459871&p=AONE&sw=w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NlFWP4NiPK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
