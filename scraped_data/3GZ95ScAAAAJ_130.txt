Data from 30 loci were used for three phylogenetic analyses. Two phenetic trees were derived: a UPGMA tree derived from Nei's unbiased genetic distance, and a distance-Wagner tree based on modified Rogers' distances. A cladistic analysis, using maximum parsimony, was also carried out with loci as characters and alleles as unordered states. The tree topology of all three analyses showed a high degree of similarity, which increased confidence in the phylogenetic interpretation and generally supported the classical taxonomic theory of centrolophid relationships. The 'hard-spined' centrolophid taxa, including Seriolella, Psenopsis, Schedophilus labyrinthicus and Hyperoglyphe, formed a stable group In all trees \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14223131877683976757", "cites_id": ["14223131877683976757"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF9941157", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NVrj2hW3YsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
