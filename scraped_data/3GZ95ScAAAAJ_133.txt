Attempts to understand its origins have focussed on the timing of speciation, rates of diversification and the directionality of colonisation across geographical and climatic gradients in an array of marine groups. We investigate origins and evolution in the Choerodon tuskfishes, a group of labrids whose centre of diversity coincides with this region. Mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear (RAG2, Tmo4c4) molecular phylogenies and biogeographic analyses, coupled with molecular clock dating, were inferred from 19 of the 23 valid Choerodon species. Two additional, undescribed Choerodon species were also included, showing reciprocal monophyly in both genomes, confirming their species level status. Choerodon diverged from their ancestral sister group, the Odacines, at the onset of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8664895870543783449", "cites_id": ["8664895870543783449"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790314003911", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GeaCu-LkP3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
