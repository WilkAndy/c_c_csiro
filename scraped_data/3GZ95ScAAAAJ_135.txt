This study expands on the previous bioregionalisations by incorporating extensively updated data on continental shelf fishes to provide current biomic and preliminary provincial regionalisations of the continental shelf of Australia.Analyses of all updated fish data available for species that occur at depths shallower than 200 m, regardless of BII (Biogeographic Information Index) scores, were conducted to determine the provincial and biomic structures. Distribution data consisting of depth and geographic start and end points, and quality control information, were recorded around the Australian continental margin for each species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14526893902924376120", "cites_id": ["14526893902924376120"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent-Lyne/publication/274008252_Analysis_of_Australian_Continental_Shelf_Provinces_and_Biomes_Based_on_Fish_Data/links/551924df0cf273292e70a48c/Analysis-of-Australian-Continental-Shelf-Provinces-and-Biomes-Based-on-Fish-Data.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OGiYtQnlmckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1}}
