It resembles a much larger, temperate Australian relative, D. thetidis, in body shape but these species differ markedly in external morphology, meristics and squamation. Dasyatis parvonigra appears to belong to a complex of poorly known species that are closely related to D. akajei (M\u00fcller & Henle, 1841). It may be more widespread in the central western Pacific."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16908090557443082996", "cites_id": ["16908090557443082996"], "pub_url": "http://www.bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/1833-2331/22/275.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9AqIcseapeoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
