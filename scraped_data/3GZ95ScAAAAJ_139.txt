It belongs to the \u2018megalops-cubens s group\u2019, the members of which share a short snout, low dorsal fins, unicuspid denticles, and a white posterior caudal marg n. The relat onsh ps of th s spec es to other members of the \u2018megalops-cubens s group\u2019are d scussed. Squalus crassispinus can be d st ngu shed from all other nom nal Squalus spec es by a comb nat on of fin coloration, dorsal-fin spine shape, denticle morphology, meristics, and morphometrics of the head, trunk and pectoral fins. Populations of S. megalops, a related, sympatr c congener that was thought to be w dely d str buted outs de the Austral an reg on, are compared on an ntrareg onal bas s. Characters once considered to be intraspecifically variable are found to be conservative within this region suggesting that the species may be more restricted in distribution than first thought.
