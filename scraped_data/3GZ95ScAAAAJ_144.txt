Orectolobus leptolineatus sp. nov., a medium-sized wobbegong reaching about 120 cm TL, is characterised by a striking colour pattern of fine vermiculations, bands, saddles and ocelli. It has been confused with a very similar congener, O. japonicus, from which it differs mainly in morphometrics and coloration, found in the Japanese Archipelago. Species previously referred to as Orectolobus japonicus likely form a complex of very closely related western Pacific species that require further morphological and molecular examination to elucidate their taxonomic complexity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4136266766770543752", "cites_id": ["4136266766770543752"], "pub_url": "http://bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/1833-2331/32/1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iJycobX4ZjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
