Distribution patterns for the two taxonomic groups were largely congruent at both between and within\u2010estuary scales. Faunal composition and the number of species collected at a site were primarily related to site salinity, the biomass of seagrass and tidal range. At the broader estuary scale, the distributions of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were primarily correlated with the presence of an entrance bar.Species richness varied with geographical location for both macrofauna and fishes, with highest numbers of species occurring in the Furneaux Group, north\u2010eastern Tasmania and south\u2010eastern Tasmania. These patterns primarily reflected differences in estuary type between regions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12126274103265242997", "cites_id": ["12126274103265242997"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00365.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:da8klgwuSagJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 0, "2010": 12, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 11, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
