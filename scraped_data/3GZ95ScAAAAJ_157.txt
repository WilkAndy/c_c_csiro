This skate, labelled the \u2018blonde skate\u2019by voyage participants, is uniformly white on all surfaces of the body and the skin is partly translucent. It belongs to a subgroup of Bathyraja with a large, almost smooth, quadrangular disc and well-developed and equally spaced median tail thorns. Other similar and probably closely related Bathyraja specimens have been caught in seas to the south of New Zealand since the discovery of this species, but their identity is yet to be confirmed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10736199739916570170", "cites_id": ["10736199739916570170"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/87474993/zootaxa.4132.1.920220614-1-cz689m.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ok5e18ek_pQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
