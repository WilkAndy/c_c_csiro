Most species were caught rarely and only 14 species were represented by> 1% of individuals in the total catch. Collectively, the catches were dominated numerically by the Acropomatidae and Chlorophthalmidae at shelf-break and upper slope depths (~ 200 to 600 m), and the Macrouridae, Bathygadidae, Synaphobranchidae, Alepocephalidae and Oreosomatidae at greater depths. Overall, the Macrouridae was both the most abundant and most species-rich family. The fauna appears to be richer (388 species from 109 families) than the slope faunas of the more intensively sampled North Atlantic and northern Pacific; its richness may be attributable to the overlap of ancient and extensive Indo-West Pacific and temperate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4652231675115363587", "cites_id": ["4652231675115363587"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v212/p247-263/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A10SWA8MkEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
