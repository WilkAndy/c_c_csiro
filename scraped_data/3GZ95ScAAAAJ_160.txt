Three of these (N. alisae n. sp., N. longiventralis n. sp. and N. fijiensis n. sp.) are \u201cvelcro skates\u201d which are characterised by their velvety dorsal and ventral surfaces, covered with fine denticles. Although similar in shape, they differ by their colour pattern, dermal armature, development of the lateral tail folds, and size of the pelvic-fin anterior lobe and nasal curtain. The description of the fourth species, Notoraja inusitata n. sp., is based on a juvenile male exhibiting some unusual features resembling those of other skate genera."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7097930350179467136", "cites_id": ["7097930350179467136"], "pub_url": "https://bioone.org/journals/zoosystema/volume-34/issue-2/z2012n2a9/New-deep-water-skates-of-the-genus-iNotoraja-i-Ishiyama/10.5252/z2012n2a9.full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gD_pCgzqgGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
