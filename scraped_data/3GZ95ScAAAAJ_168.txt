A rapid assessment method for characterising landings at fish markets, using an index of abundance and estimated weight within taxonomic groups, is described. This approach was developed for contexts where there are no detailed data collection protocols, and where consistent data collection across a wide range of fisheries types and geographic areas is required, regardless of the size of the site and scale of the landings. This methodology, which was demonstrated at seven fish landing sites/fish markets in southern Indonesia between July 2008 and January 2011, provides a rapid assessment of the abundance and diversity in the wild catch over a wide variety of taxonomic groups. The approach has wider application for species-rich fisheries in developing countries where there is an urgent need for better data collection protocols, monitoring future changes in market demographics, and evaluating health of fisheries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=258481447311107122", "cites_id": ["258481447311107122"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109182", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MuQBwIFPlgMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
