It differs from existing schemes for classifying marine biota by explicitly recognizing the overarching influence of large-scale biodiversity patterns at realm (ocean basin and tectonic), provincial (palaeohistorical) and bathomic (depth-related) levels. The classification consists of 10 nested levels within realms, of which the first seven are primarily spatially nested and ecosystem based, and the lowest levels represent units of taxonomic inheritance: 1 \u2013 provinces, 2 \u2013 bathomes, 3 \u2013 geomorphological units, 4 \u2013 primary biotopes, 5 \u2013 secondary biotopes, 6 \u2013 biological facies, 7 \u2013 micro-communities, 8 \u2013 species, 9 \u2013 populations, and 10 \u2013 genes.
