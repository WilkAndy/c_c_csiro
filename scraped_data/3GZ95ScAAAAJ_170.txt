Okamejei jensenae sp. nov. can be distinguished from other members of the genus found in this region by a combination of coloration, squamation, morphometrics and meristics. Another rajid skate, Dipturus kwangtungensis (Chu), newly collected from the southern South China Sea, off western Borneo, is redescribed based on material collected by the Fisheries Research Institute, Sarawak. This species is frequently confused in the literature with other species of Dipturus found in the western North Pacific."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2656746664963319654", "cites_id": ["2656746664963319654"], "pub_url": "http://bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/1833-2331/32/101.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZqdXBwSp3iQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
