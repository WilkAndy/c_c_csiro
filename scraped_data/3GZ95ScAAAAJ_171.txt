The two new species are superficially similar to each other and reach the same maximum size (about 100 cm TL), but they differ significantly in some body proportions and in colour. Rhinobatos penggali belongs to a subgroup of white-spotted Rhinobatos species that includes R. punctifer from the western Indian Ocean, but they differ in some body proportions and the configuration of spots. Rhinobatos jimbaranensis lacks white spots. Rhinobatos penggali is known from markets at Bali and south Java, whilst R. jimbaranensis is known only from Jimbaran Bay (southern Bali)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11246986687557272841", "cites_id": ["11246986687557272841"], "pub_url": "https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:aef5658", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CQVmoc1SFZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
