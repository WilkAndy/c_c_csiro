A. funebris and A. submaculatus can be distinguished from all other members of the genus by their relatively robust bodies, short caudal fins and smooth tricuspidate teeth. A. submaculatus is covered in black spots whereas A. funebris has only large brownish blotches and has narrower, more erect dorsal fins. The smallest known member of the genus, A. parvus, appears to be more closely related to the dark-spotted catsharks of the analis subgroup but has a pale brown body covered in white spots and blotches."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10973550944091085895", "cites_id": ["10973550944091085895"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/CMReport_239.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R5wze3HiSZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
