This specimen represents the first record of the family Rhinobatidae in Papua New Guinean waters. Based on molecular data, the new species appears to be most similar to Rhinobatos whitei (Philippines) and Rhinobatos sainsburyi (northern Australia), but is distinguished based on its coloration, morphology and certain meristic characters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3250597256194943127", "cites_id": ["3250597256194943127"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/27811742", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l-hba_twHC0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
