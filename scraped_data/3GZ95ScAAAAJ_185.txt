A diagnosis is given for this ray, along with information on its distribution and features which distinguish H. fai from other Himantura species found in the Great Barrier Reef. Previous records of its monogenean parasite fauna are clarified to avoid further confusion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14720775414791504642", "cites_id": ["14720775414791504642"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14720775414791504642&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AoPz6D6zSswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
