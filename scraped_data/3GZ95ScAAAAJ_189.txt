Morphological data based on this specimen supported its placement in a new genus Orbiraja that is assigned to the recently named Rostrorajini based on molecular evidence. This subgroup of the family Rajidae also includes Malacoraja, Neoraja, Rostroraja and an unresolved'amphi-American Assemblage'(sensu McEachran & Dunn, 1998). Orbiraja is unique within the rajids in having the combination of three, very closely spaced median thorn rows on the tail, no dark-edged ventral pores, and a clasper skeleton with a prominent accessory terminal 3 cartilage formed by a medio-distal extension of the accessory terminal 2 cartilage. Its spiracle appears to be situated posteriorly with respect to the orbit. The group contains two other nominal species, Orbiraja powelli (Alcock) and O. philipi (Lloyd), and an un-named species from Indonesia that needs further investigation. Orbiraja jensenae is rediagnosed based on characteristics of the adult male."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17353886489433461870", "cites_id": ["17353886489433461870"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/27811653", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:btQhO9Fj1fAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
