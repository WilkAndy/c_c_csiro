In the last decade, chondrichthyan taxonomy has undergone a scientific renaissance with >180 new species formally described. This effort encompasses c. 15% of the global chondrichthyan fauna, which consists of 1185 currently recognized species. The important role of chondrichthyan taxonomy for conservation management has been highlighted in recent years with new species descriptions or taxonomic resolution of a number of threatened species. These include Australian gulper (genus Centrophorus) and speartooth sharks (genus Glyphis) in coastal waters of Australia and Borneo. Closer examination of other wide\u2010ranging species, for which the taxonomy was thought to be stable, has shown that they consist of species complexes, e.g. manta rays (Manta spp.) and spotted eagle rays (the Aetobatus narinari \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14332886804912852648", "cites_id": ["14332886804912852648"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.03192.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qM62NJyk6MYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 14, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
