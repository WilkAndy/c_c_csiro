The following key is incomplete; clearly separating some genera but failing to distinguish others. For example, genera in couplet 14 could not be distinguished so readers need to use distributional ranges (which largely do not overlap) to help identify species. Where a specimen fails to key out correctly, we suggest proceeding again using the alterative option in couplets. The key below has incorporated some technical characters in order to distinguish between genera (see the Glossary for further explanation)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=220017796273655964", "cites_id": ["220017796273655964"], "pub_url": "https://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers21-02/010072278.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nNAnHwWpDQMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
