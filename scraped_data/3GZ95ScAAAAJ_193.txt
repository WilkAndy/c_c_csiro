Most of this material was collected in 2003 by the New Zealand vessel, RV Tangaroa, during the NORFANZ voyage. These species extend the known range of the genus northward along theNorfolk Ridge, and along with B. aenigma, are the only other representatives of the genus found outside seas adjacentNew Zealand. Brochiraja heuresa sp. nov. is known from the western Norfolk Ridge and the Wanganella Bank at 870\u20131350 m depth, whereas B. vittacauda sp. nov. is known from a smaller area of the western Norfolk Ridge at 629\u2013973 mdepth. These species differ from each other, and from other nominal members of the genus, in morphometrics, meristics, coloration and squamation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12199591317782429505", "cites_id": ["12199591317782429505"], "pub_url": "https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/12762", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QX9c1aqnTakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
