Current economic values of commercial fisheries were compiled by each State along with the Commonwealth-managed offshore fisheries. Marine tourism and recreational fishing values were also compiled but the tourism statistics are crude estimates only to determine their value relative to the fisheries sector. Scenarios of climate change impacts on the marine environment were obtained from the CSIRO climate model runs for 2030 and 2070. Each marine species was rated according to two main criteria: 1) vulnerability\u2013which expresses the physiological ability of the species to cope with the predicted environmental changes, and 2) relocation\u2013which rates the species ability to move to more favourable locations in response to detrimental environmental changes. Each criterion was scored as no, low, medium or high and the scoring was undertaken by experienced fish taxonomists. Numerical factors were assigned to the scores but these are at best educated guesses that need to be refined; however, they are expected to provide an order of magnitude assessment of the relative impacts. The vulnerability scoring reflects a general trait of marine species to be able to tolerate environment fluctuations up to a threshold followed by a rapid impact as environmental conditions degrade above the threshold. Thus, while many species may display little or no impact up to the threshold, catastrophic impacts will occur as conditions degrade further.The 2030 scenario shows an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18166541361842129763", "cites_id": ["18166541361842129763"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/48639317/Economic_analysis_of_identified_impacts_20160907-16248-g32je8.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y4sKPh6FHPwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
