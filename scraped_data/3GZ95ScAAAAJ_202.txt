Wind and sea spray affect the flora and fauna in a wide maritime zone inland. There are few obligate coastal endemic plants and few exotic plant species have established. Approximately 60 vegetated coastal islands contain more vertebrate species than the rest of the WHA, SOme endemic to these islands, to the WHA and to Tasmania."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3961472755779831104", "cites_id": ["3961472755779831104"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen-Harris-4/publication/272622618_The_biological_significance_of_a_coastline_in_the_Roaring_Forties_latitudes/links/55ee3e0608ae199d47bee77e/The-biological-significance-of-a-coastline-in-the-Roaring-Forties-latitudes.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QAWli3v6-TYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
