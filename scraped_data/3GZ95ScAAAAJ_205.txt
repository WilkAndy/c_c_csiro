These represent the first records of the family Platyrhinidae from the Indian Ocean with the three other members of the genus being restricted to the North-West Pacific. The new species differs from its congeners in having a series of faint dark bands on the body and tail, more pectoral-fin radials, and much more widely separated dorsal fins."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1320551386218819925", "cites_id": ["1320551386218819925"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/27395241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VfE4O32KUxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
