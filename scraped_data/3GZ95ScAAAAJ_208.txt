Members of the group occur primarily on the outer continental shelf and upper slope in both temperate and tropical Australian seas. The species are strongly partitioned geographically with smallto medium-scale ranges. Pavoraja arenaria is known to have a broad southern distribution but none is widespread in the Australian region. Only two species pairs, P. nitida and P. arenaria (off southern Australia), and P. mosaica and P. pseudonitida (off northeastern Australia), are known to be sympatric. New information is provided for the two nominal taxa, and the four new species are formally described and figured.
