It differs from T. testacea, with which it is sympatric off the southeastern Australian coast, in lacking a dorsal fin, having a shorter prespiracular length, deeper caudal fin, and a shorter prenasal length. It differs from a western congener, T. mucosa, which also lacks a dorsal fin, in having a shorter prespiracular length and is much larger. The new species is the largest Trygonoptera species and one of the largest urolophids. It occurs from Jervis Bay (New South Wales) south through northern Bass Strait (including Flinders Island) to Beachport (South Australia), in shallow embayments and coastal waters to depths of 120 m."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11273638089736320637", "cites_id": ["11273638089736320637"], "pub_url": "http://bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/1833-2331/22/261.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ffYLwRwCdJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
