The transformation larvae ofP. praelonga are distinguishable from the congeners of the same stage in having relatively low body depth (2.20\u20132.44 in SL), relatively large maxilla extending to anterior one-third of lower eye, and seven and six distinct spots along the dorsal and ventral margins of ocular side body, respectively. In the smallest specimen, the intestine was expanded posteriorly beyond the posterior wall of visceral cavity, but not in the larger specimens. The pectoral fin rays and the spines of scales were supposed to begin to be formed by about 80 mm SL.
