The emphasis has been on fishes generally but these studies have also contributed greatly to our knowledge of chondrichthyans in the region, as well as across the broader Indo\u2013West Pacific. An annotated checklist of cartilaginous fishes of the Philippines is compiled based on historical information and new data. A Taiwanese deepwater trawl survey off Luzon in 1995 produced specimens of 15 species including 12 new records for the Philippines and a few species new to science. Soon after, a major survey of fish markets in the southern Philippines, funded by the World Wildlife Fund, resulted in the collection and storage of specimens of 54 species, of which 41 were new records for the Philippines. Approximately 164 species representing 44 families and 83 genera of cartilaginous fishes have been recorded from Philippine seas from all available sources. The checklist includes 129 valid species records that are based on specimens and unambiguous literature accounts, and 35 additional doubtful records that are mostly based on literature. Of the valid species, about 111 were wholly or partly based on literature records; 109 species wholly or partly on specimens from all sources including museum collections. At least 24 species, mostly collected during the recent surveys, are new to science. An historical overview of research on Philippine cartilaginous fishes is provided, along with sections on the classification, habitat and distribution of the fauna, and a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14073698462181484169", "cites_id": ["14073698462181484169"], "pub_url": "https://epub.sub.uni-hamburg.de/epub/volltexte/2007/186/pdf/CSIRO_mlrs243_full.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ieZJii_ST8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
