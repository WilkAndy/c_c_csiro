Body entirely naked above and below, without dermal denticles or thorns. Trunk depressed and flattened, not shark-like. Precaudal tail moderately depressed, usually with variously developed lateral ridges on sides, tail abruptly narrower than trunk; no barbed sting (stinger or stinging spine) on dorsal surface of tail behind dorsal fins, no electric organs in tail. Head broad and depressed; snout moderately elongated, broadly rounded or obtusely rounded-angular; snout supported by large, anteriorly extended rostral cartilage and by anterolaterally expanded antorbital cartilages; rostral cartilage projecting forward towards snout tip in a straight line or at a slight angle; snout not formed into a rostral saw and without lateral saw teeth. Five small gill openings on underside of front half of pectoral-fin bases, not visible in lateral view; no gill sieves or rakers on internal gills. Eyes dorsolateral on head and just anterior and partly medial to spiracles. Spiracles with or without small papillae; when papillae are present these are never elongated; spiracles without elevated rims or with small rims; spiracles circular to oval in shape. Mouth transverse and straight, without prominent knobs and depressions but with strong labial folds and a prominent groove around its periphery. Nostrils just anterior to mouth and separated from it by much less than the space between them, connected by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:isU91gLudPYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1528225405967087806", "cites_id": ["1528225405967087806"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1528225405967087806&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vjhl6-hYNRUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
