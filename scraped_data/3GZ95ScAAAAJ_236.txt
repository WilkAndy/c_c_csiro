It represents the second valid species of the genus and the first occurrence of the group in the eastern Indian Ocean. Within the family Proscylliidae, it shares with its congener, P. habereri (Hilgendorf) from the western Pacific, large anterior nasal flaps with their posterior ends almost reaching the symphysis of the upper jaw but differs from P. habereri in possessing a greatly enlarged lobe at the angle of each flap. It also differs in having the second dorsal-fin origin slightly forward of the anal-fin origin, larger head dimensions, relatively longer and lower labial furrows, larger pectoral and caudal fins, a shorter interdorsal distance, a lower vertebral count and a more striking colour pattern."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=948072645686763756", "cites_id": ["948072645686763756"], "pub_url": "https://projects.dmcr.go.th/dmcr/fckupload/upload/44/image/FullpaperPMBC/2004%20Vol.65%20Last%2023%2029.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7KBsUww7KA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
