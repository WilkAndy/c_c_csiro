This species is unusual in the genus in having the third OVA and L photophores located ventrally on the flank and in lacking an adipose fin. The posttemporal has only a single spine, unlike other members of the spinosus species group. Other features of the spinosus group are present, notably, scales with spinelike denticles covering the ventral photophores and serrate lateral ridges on the ventral limb of the composite posttemporal-supracleithrum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9568544376752907852", "cites_id": ["9568544376752907852"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1446687", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TCbrEWpMyoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
