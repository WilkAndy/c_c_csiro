Most of the catches are not reported by species, but by larger mixed categories that do not allow accurate stock management. In many instances shark-like rays (wedgefishes, guitarfishes, sawfishes) get grouped into \u2018sharks\u2019, so estimates of \u2018ray\u2019landings can be seriously underestimated. Indonesia has the largest shark and ray fishery in the world, with landing estimates in the low 2000s to in excess of 100 000 tonnes annually. In the artisanal fishery sector of Indonesia, rays account for about half of the total chondrichthyan catches, with stingrays (Dasyatidae) comprising about 90% of the total catch of rays by number and almost 45% by weight. In Mexico, artisanal fishery catches of chondrichthyans comprise almost equal quantities of rays to sharks.While rays are used selectively throughout their distribution for their flesh (eg skates in the North Atlantic, stingrays from Asian seas), few species have been traditionally targeted. Most are either discarded (dead or alive) or find their way to markets as part of the byproduct of other fisheries. However, in recent years there has been increasing localised effort to target rays for more specialised uses. The Oriental shark-fin trade has led to dramatic increases in shark fishing in many regions over the last century. The shark-like rays are particularly sought after for the shark-fin trade and can attain higher prices than equivalent-sized shark species. These are sold together with other shark fins and are often difficult to distinguish from shark species, particularly once dried. This had led to targeting of rays in some areas.
