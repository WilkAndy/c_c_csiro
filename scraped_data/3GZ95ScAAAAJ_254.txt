In addition to substrate type, their biotic compositions are controlled by environmental factors such as depth and wave exposure. These habitats are distributed in a distinctive pattern around Tasman Peninsula: the deep, exposed reef habitats along the eastern and southern coasts; the shallow, sheltered, soft-bottom habitats along the northern coast; and embayments of variable depths, exposures and substrate types. Eleven subtidal communities or groups of communities are identified from these habitats and their general features are described"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11058154404822207855", "cites_id": ["11058154404822207855"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.utas.edu.au/14620/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b03Zstd0dpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2}}
