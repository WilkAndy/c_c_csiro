In addition, thorn patterns, denticle distributions, color, and clasper morphology were compared. No body proportions or other single character that could differentiate D. lamillai from Z. brevicaudata were found. Molecular analyses comprised the comparison of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2. The results of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) carried out for each molecular marker showed that sequences from D. lamillai clustered together with those of Z. brevicaudata, and molecular distance determined by Kimura two-parameter, was lower than the expected for different species. Additionally, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method and the Bayesian implementation of the Poisson tree processes were carried out with COI sequences to explore species limits, and their results were consistent with ML analyses. In summary, the results obtained showed that there are no morphological or molecular differences between these nominal species of the valid skate genus Zearaja, leading to the conclusion that they are conspecific. Therefore, Z. brevicaudata is designated as a senior synonym of D. lamillai."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7793620350523617499", "cites_id": ["7793620350523617499"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei-Yang-29/publication/364341369_Morphological_and_Molecular_Evidence_Reveals_the_Longnose_Skate_Zearaja_brevicaudata_Marini_1933_to_be_a_Senior_Synonym_of_Dipturus_lamillai_Concha_Caira_Ebert_Pompert_2019/links/634c5a40ff870c55ce2a89e1/Morphological-and-Molecular-Evidence-Reveals-the-Longnose-Skate-Zearaja-brevicaudata-Marini-1933-to-be-a-Senior-Synonym-of-Dipturus-lamillai-Concha-Caira-Ebert-Pompert-2019.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2zA3m2qAKGwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
