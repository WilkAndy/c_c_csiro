Reality is quite different, with the biota (genes, species and communities) developing and changing continually in a dynamic competition for survival. Any record or data point is no more than a snapshot of this continuum. We\u2019re only now coming to recognise the importance of identifying, and even protecting, these evolutionary processes in the marine environment and the key areas where they occur, with the goal of maintaining the capacity of the \u2018system\u2019to adapt to further change. This recognition is based on an increasingly robust marine taxonomy.The CERF Marine Biodiversity Hub has increased our understanding of Australia\u2019s marine biota, one of the most diverse and complex of any region. We\u2019ve improved and developed new continental-scale baseline datasets, and provided new analyses to support marine bioregional plans around Australia. We\u2019ve shown that Australia\u2019s marine species-richness has been underestimated, especially for invertebrates. Where we can identify species, many are endemic\u201327% of marine worms or polychaetes collected off Western Australian were endemic\u2013but for some groups we do not have the taxonomic knowledge to identify to this level; only a few dozen of the over 600 species of microcrustaceans from the same area could be identified to species, so the uniqueness of this Australian fauna could not be determined. These are not isolated examples, but reflect the current state of our knowledge, especially in deeper \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14314054933015464499", "cites_id": ["14314054933015464499"], "pub_url": "https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/system/files/CERF%20MB%20Hub%20-%20Milestone%208%20Report%2024-3-11%20Gledhill.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M4rQWR-9pcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
