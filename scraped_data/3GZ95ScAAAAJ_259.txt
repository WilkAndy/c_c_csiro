While all estuarine systems possess a unique combination of physical characteristics, the Port Davey \u2013 Bathurst Harbour system can justifiably be regarded as Australia\u2019s most unique estuary, and perhaps the most anomalous globally. The unusual combination of factors operating in this system include: 1. negligible human population density in catchment 2. little anthropogenic impact in estuary 3. large water volume and surface area 4. ria formation, but with many fjord characteristics, including narrow deep channels and relatively shallow sill at seaward entrance 5. high levels of riverine input 6. strongly stratified conditions that vary seasonally, with marine salt wedge and low-salinity surface layer 7. low-salinity surface layer deeply tannin-stained, blocking light penetration to depth 8. low levels of nutrients and low aquatic productivity 9. seaward entrance of main channel protected from wave action by island barriers 10. strong barometric influence on tides 11. low residence time of bottom water 12. high stability of bottom water with respect to temperature and chemical signature Biological characteristics of the region The anomalous combination of geomorphological, climatic, hydrodynamic and hydrological conditions operating in the Port Davey region has generated an aquatic environment with a highly unusual mix of flora and fauna.
