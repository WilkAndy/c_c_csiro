In their morphologically based phylogenetic study of the group, the family Rajidae (at subgeneric level) was found to consist of 15 genera; five of these were elevated from the subgenera of Raja (ie, Amblyraja, Malm 1877; Dipturus Rafinesque, 1810; Leucoraja Malm, 1877; Okamejei Ishiyama, 1958; and Rajella Stehmann, 1970). These taxa remain in use at the generic level but there have been several amendments to the classification. Dipturus was described by Rafinesque (1810), who characterized the genus by the presence of two dorsal fins in the tail, and the absence of a caudal fin, and considered Dipturus batis (as Raja batis Linnaeus, 1758) the type species. Whitley (1939) described Zearaja Whitley, 1939, providing only the description of the type species Zearaja nasuta, which was originally described as Raja nasuta M\u00fcller and Henle, 1841. Considering the neurocranium morphology of this species, Stehmann and B\u00fcrkel (1990) considered Zearaja as a synonym of Dipturus. Last and Gledhill (2007) resurrected the genus Zearaja from synonymy with Dipturus, including their new species Zearaja maugeana Last and Gledhill, 2007, as well as Raia chilensis Guichenot, 1848 and Raja nasuta. Some taxonomic issues have been addressed with the elevation of Zearaja from Dipturus based mainly on morphological data (Last and Gledhill 2007) and supported by unpublished molecular data (Naylor, Chondrichthyan Tree \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:RJOyoaXV5v8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei-Yang-29/publication/364341369_Morphological_and_Molecular_Evidence_Reveals_the_Longnose_Skate_Zearaja_brevicaudata_Marini_1933_to_be_a_Senior_Synonym_of_Dipturus_lamillai_Concha_Caira_Ebert_Pompert_2019/links/63aca413a03100368a3628f7/Morphological-and-Molecular-Evidence-Reveals-the-Longnose-Skate-Zearaja-brevicaudata-Marini-1933-to-be-a-Senior-Synonym-of-Dipturus-lamillai-Concha-Caira-Ebert-Pompert-2019.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vyjVF6C5th4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
