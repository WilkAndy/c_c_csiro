Location Southern Australia and the IWP. Taxon Platycephalidae (flathead fishes). Methods Nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies of flathead fishes were inferred from 46 of 85 nominal species, and 14 additional cryptic species-level lineages, representing 17 of the 18 genera. Molecular clocks and habitat trait reconstructions were used to infer the palaeoclimatic and geological events responsible for shaping the evolution and diversification of the group. Results The family Platycephalidae comprises two sister subfamilies; Platycephalinae and Onigociinae, which diverged in the Eocene into predominantly temperate and tropical assemblages respectively. The basal platycephalin taxa are confined to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14932668402775529500&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
