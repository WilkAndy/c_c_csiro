Any museum curator will tell you that it is a constant struggle to convince them to do so, despite countless publications rendered unreliable because it is impossible to verify species\u2019 identities. The necessity of voucher specimens varies by taxon and region, but in general, it is good practice to deposit them and as much data as possible, including DNA and photos in life. We certainly do not wish to see any species driven to extinction by overcollecting, but submit that this is rare and more associated with commercial or ardent, recreational overcollecting than sensible scientific vouchering (1, 2). If the kill of a single individual increases the extinction risk of a species, then it is well below viable population size and already among the \u201cwalking dead.\u201d Dawkins\u2019 description of evolution as improbability on a colossal scale is nowhere more evident than in morphology. Whether or not a species survives, museum specimens represent a window on many of its most remarkable novelties. Molecular data, although helpful in identifications, is neither a panacea nor surrogate for museum specimens, especially when it comes to newly discovered species. Describing a new species without depositing a holotype when a specimen can be preserved borders on taxonomic malpractice. Even given good photographs and a tissue sample, there are reasons to collect one or more complete specimens. We do not know what morphological characters will prove important in future studies of species status \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank-Thorsten-Krell/publication/262727104_Specimen_collection_Plan_for_the_future/links/00b7d53ab07b3b3dc6000000/Specimen-collection-Plan-for-the-future.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h2BKlWAncHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
