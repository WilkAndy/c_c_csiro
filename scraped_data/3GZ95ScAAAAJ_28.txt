Phylogenetic reconstruction methods reproduced nearly identical and statistically robust topologies supporting the monophyly of the genus Neotrygon within the family Dasyatidae, the genus Taeniura being consistently basal to Neotrygon, and Dasyatis being polyphyletic to the genera Taeniurops and Pteroplatytrygon. The Neotrygon kuhlii complex, once considered to be an assemblage of color variants of the same biological species, is the most derived and widely dispersed subgroup of the genus. Mitochondrial (COI, 16S) and nuclear (RAG1) phylogenies used in synergy with molecular dating identified paleoclimatic fluctuations responsible for periods of vicariance and dispersal promoting population fragmentation and speciation in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15515706040986339835", "cites_id": ["15515706040986339835"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.448", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-4lfRHDcUtcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 10, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
