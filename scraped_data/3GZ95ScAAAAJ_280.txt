The ecological study is part of a whole-of-systems approach evolved through applications in an Australian and Pacific Island context to address regional planning. The core of that approach is conceptualising ecological systems as a hierarchical nesting of systems at various scales. Each system in the hierarchy has a set of components and processes comprising inputs/drivers, assets in the form of functional groups and habitats, and process linkages and transformation associated with the supply of ecological services. In the socio-economic application, a range of contextual and performance factors are examined to determine a nested structuring of geographic localities. The change in those regional structures was explored with respect to migration, changes in the contextual/performance factors and changes in the profiles of industries. Commonalities in the two studies\u2014which are the subject of this paper\u2014revolve around the strength of structures and their typologies (composition) and the stability of those structures. Strong typologies display weak tendencies to exchange with others, while weaker typologies may act as hubs that facilitate change across typologies that are very different. While change in both systems can take place through different modes, each mode may involve alternate pathways through weak structures that act as hubs of exchange."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/68445156/A_typological_study_on_stability_of_stru20210731-11577-bzbwcv.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
