This is being done separately for the South East, South West, North, North West and Eastern Marine Regions. This firstly requires the gathering, reviewing and summarising of the best available information on important habitats, species, natural processes, heritage values, human uses and benefits into a Regional Profile for use in the MBP process.The East Marine Region (EMR) covers more than 2.4 million square kilometres of water under Commonwealth jurisdiction from Bermagui in the south (150 7\u2019E, 36 30\u2019S) to the northern extent of the Great Barrier Reef (144 28\u2019E, 9 39\u2019S) from the limit of state waters (3 nm from the coastal baseline), but not including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, to the limit of Australia\u2019s EEZ, 1,000 km offshore at its widest extent. It also includes the EEZ territory surrounding Norfolk Island."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=f524b38820236a628e016b777116b9fafa7b2be5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vc6BubkzI1IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
