Rhinobatos sainsburyi belongs to an unresolved supraspecific complex that includes the type of the genus, R. rhinobatos (Linnaeus), and at least 9 other species that occur in the Indo-Pacific. Rhinobatos sainsburyi differs from these species by a combination of morphometry, squamation and colour. Aptychotrema timorensis, a third valid member of an endemic Australian genus, differs from its congeners in morphometry, and in having a narrower snout apex, fewer caudal vertebrae, and white spots on its dorsal surface. a"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:Wq2b2clWBLsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11982189373558484358&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hu1pOsBJSaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
