Some of the inshore species have extremely restricted distributions, a feature that makes their populations highly vulnerable to disturbance. The spotted handfish (Brachionichthys hirsutus) is endemic to a small area of SE Tasmania and was common throughout the lower Derwent estuary and adjoining bays prior to the mid 1980's. It has since suffered a serious decline in distribution and abundance.
