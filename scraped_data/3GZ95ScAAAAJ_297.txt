Trunk depressed and flattened, not shark-like. Precaudal tail slightly depressed and subcylindrical, without lateral folds on sides, tail abruptly narrower than trunk, a prominent barbed sting (stinger or stinging spine) on dorsal surface of tail well behind pelvic fins; no electric organs in tail. Head broad and depressed; snout moderately elongated (over 6 times orbit diameter), broadly angular; snout supported entirely by pectoral-fin skeleton, no rostral cartilage; snout not formed into a rostral saw and without lateral saw teeth. Five small gill openings on underside of front half of pectoral disc, not visible in lateral view; no gill sieves or rakers on internal gill slits. Eyes small and dorsolateral on head, just anteromedial to spiracles. Mouth transverse, straight and moderately broad, without prominent knobs, depressions or labial folds; no oral papillae on floor of mouth. Nostrils very wide and just anterior to mouth, separated from it by much less than their own widths and connected by broad nasoral grooves with mouth; anterior nasal flaps short and medially expanded and fused into a very broad, short nasal curtain that ends just anterior to mouth. Oral teeth small, rounded-oval in shape and with short cusps on their crowns, not laterally expanded and plate-like, similar in shape and between 30 to 62 rows in either jaw (more rows present in adults than in young). Pectoral fins very large and forming a nearly circular disc, originating at anterior tip of snout and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5201122237477269568&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QLA3Rh4ZLkgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
