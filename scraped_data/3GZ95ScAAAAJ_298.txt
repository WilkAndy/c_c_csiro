Species were classified into one of the distributional groups listed below based on information from the published literature (eg, Chen, 1963; Masuda et al., 1984; Monkolprasit, 1984; Compagno 1984, 1988; Compagno et al., 1989) as well as several key regional references that are currently in press such as sharks of the South China Sea (Compagno, in press), rays of the South China Sea (Last and Compagno, in press), and FAO identification sheets to sharks and rays of the western Central Pacific (Compagno et al., in press). The Australasian fauna consists of 5 primary biogeographic components and 23 secondary elements: 1. Subregional endemics (5 ele-ments), endemic species confined to each of the four subregions or New Guinea; 2. Ex-traregional temperate component (2 elements), New Zealand species, or Australian tem-perate species that either have a primary distribution in the southwestern (Flindersian) or southeastern (Peronian) Australian Provinces, or have a widespread distribution around the southern coast (sensu Whitley, 1932; Thackway and Cresswell, 1997); 3. Australasian regional component (3 elements), Coral Sea species (Australian/New Caledonian endemics or species confined to the south-west Pacific), east Indian Ocean species (confined to eastern Indonesia and tropical Australia), and tropical Australasian species (species occurring only off tropical Australia or extending more broadly across"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6877477778156353577&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KfimzZm1cV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
