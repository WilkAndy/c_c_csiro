First dorsal fin originates behind anterior half of total length, base varying from over rear halves of pelvic-fin bases to behind rear tips of pelvic fins and junction between trunk and tail but well anterior to midlength of tail. Caudal fin large, about as large as pelvic fins, not shark-like, asymmetrical or symmetrical, with vertebral axis hardly raised above body axis; lower caudal lobe not projecting outwards posteriorly. Colour: dorsal surface varies from whitish, yellowish, brownish, grey-brown, greenish, reddish, or black above, usually white below but black in deep-water species; dorsal surface either unspotted or with small to large dark spots, blotches, bars or lines, or white spots and lines, sometimes forming complex eye-shaped spots or ocelli on pectoral fins."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18125331287479388741&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RYp7GsYcivsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
