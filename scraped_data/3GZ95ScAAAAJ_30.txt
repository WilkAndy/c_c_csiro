The new species is closely related to a Hawaiian endemic species, S. colorata. The two species are distinguished from other Indo\u2013Pacific species of Scorpaena by the following combination of characters: exposed cycloid scales covering the anteroventral surface of the body and pectoral-fin base, the lateral surface of the lacrimal without spines, and 17 pectoral-fin rays. The new species differs from S. colorata in having 39\u201344 longitudinal scales rows and relatively short fin spines and rays, especially short longest pectoral-fin ray (31.5\u201333.5% of standard length). Morphological changes with growth and sexual dimorphism of the new species are also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8365723020766515359", "cites_id": ["8365723020766515359"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hiroyuki-Motomura/publication/238095021_Scorpaena_bulacephala_a_new_species_of_scorpionfish_Scorpaeniformes_Scorpaenidae_from_the_northern_Tasman_Sea/links/5556e26d08ae6fd2d823751a/Scorpaena-bulacephala-a-new-species-of-scorpionfish-Scorpaeniformes-Scorpaenidae-from-the-northern-Tasman-Sea.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n5AYjsMEGXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
