A principal element of this framework is a spatial assessment of the distribution of the faunal elements, their conservation value and status, and their grouping into bioregions. Much interest has centred on the regionalisation aspect with a variety of datasets and methodologies used to designate regional boundaries. The preoccupation with boundary delineation and the lack of a firm scientific basis in a number of these regionalisations, based on the delphic ideology or abiotic surrogates, has resulted in considerable confusion and debate on the issue. As conservation concerns mount, and the need for adequate and representative measures increase, there is an increasing realisation, appreciation and urgency in the need for credible bioregionalisations. The focus has to be on what is being conserved and protected-namely, the biotic elements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent-Lyne/publication/274008113_Interim_Marine_Bioregionalisation_for_Australia_Towards_a_National_System_of_Marine_Protected_Areas/links/5edf803e299bf1d20bdb226d/Interim-Marine-Bioregionalisation-for-Australia-Towards-a-National-System-of-Marine-Protected-Areas.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KlmE9J48Hd4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
