It exists as a computerized database that can be easily accessed through searches, added to or modified, and that can be manipulated into a hardcopy reference for publication. In the Australian region, where the composition and nomenclature of the fish fauna is so unstable, the facility to upgrade the list continuously is a great advantage. The Australian fish fauna is considered to contain slightly more than 3600 species from 303 families. Because of its size, the fauna will be treated in two volumes. This volume, updated to 1985, covers 2027 species from the first 186 families based on the phylogenetic sequence of Greenwood et al.(1966) with modi-fications from more recent works. The families covered, the Petromyzontidae though to the Carangidae, essentially include the agnathans, chondrichthyans, primitive teleosts and some perciform families. The family list was finalized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1446522", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jM2Od2aEmrAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
