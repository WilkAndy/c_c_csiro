An examination of additional material of P. pseudodorsalis from southern Africa and Australasia (242-559mm SL) has revealed the presence of two distinct post-juvenile growth forms, with a belated transition stage between them at about 270-365mm SL. Subadults display allometric growth and have greater rugosity and ornamentation of head bones and scales than adults. During the transformation period, growth becomes linear, scales become less obvious and their surfaces less ornamented, and prominent bony ridges of the head exfoliate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cir.nii.ac.jp/crid/1390282679744435584", "cites_per_year": {}}
