BACKGROUNDThis strategic mapping and analysis project will assess the status and condition of seabed habitats, seagrasses and benthic biodiversity in the complex ecosystem of the Torres Strait; establish benchmarks and performance indicators for feedback to management; and facilitate detection of anthropogenic impact in seabed ecosystems (eg trawling) among the range of other natural environmental variability. The challenging large-scale objectives of this Task will be met by multidisciplinary inputs from collaborating specialists from several research providers. This approach will support Regional Marine Planning and multiple-use management in Torres Strait, and is also relevant to the national objectives of the Commonwealth Department of Environment & Water Resources (DEW) as outlined by Australia's Oceans Policy. The objectives of the project will also deliver to the highest'High Priority'research areas identified by the Biological Diversity Advisory Council as well as the \u201careas of research of national importance\u201d(Biodiversity Research: Australia\u2019s Priorities\u2014a Discussion Paper. Environment Australia 2000). With links to other Project areas, one major outcome will be to assist AFMA to conduct strategic assessments and ESD indicator reporting for the TS Trawl Fishery and enable evaluation of the ecological performance of alternate management scenarios and optimisation of trade-offs to meet its goals of environmental sustainability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Hooper-9/publication/233979462_Mapping_and_Characterisation_of_Key_Biotic_Physical_Attributes_of_the_Torres_Strait_Ecosystem/links/0fcfd50e925cfc3d39000000/Mapping-and-Characterisation-of-Key-Biotic-Physical-Attributes-of-the-Torres-Strait-Ecosystem.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:65dpUT-vZM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
