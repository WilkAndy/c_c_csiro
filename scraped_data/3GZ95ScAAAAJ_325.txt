Dive and longline surveys, passive acoustic telemetry and satellite tracking were used to collect data. Of interest to management, was whether existing sanctuary zones were effective for elasmobranchs as well as the location and timing of aggregation sites reported for some species. Satellite tagging data: Two types of platform transmitter terminals (PTTs) were used, Wildlife Computers (Redmond, USA) smart position or temperature transmitting tag (SPOT4 or SPOT5) and SPLASH tags. Longline survey data Longline fishing was used to survey elasmobranchs outside the reef and was carried out from the Western \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17750500860559166398&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
