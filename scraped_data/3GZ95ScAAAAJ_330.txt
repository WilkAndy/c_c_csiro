Leading fish taxonomists, fish-book authors, members of the Fish Names Committee, and representatives of key stakeholder groups cooperated to produce the standard names list, which was also made available for public comment. The current list once-and-for-all eliminates confusion surrounding fish names in Australia. Species that were previously known by up to a dozen or more names around the country now have a single standard name, and species that lacked a common name now have one assigned. Seafood Services Australia Ltd, which is registered with Standards Australia as a standards development organisation, combined the list presented here with the names of imported fishes, commercial groupings of species, and commercial invertebrates (domestic and imported) to produce the Australian Standard Fish Names List (ASFNL). The ASFNL will form part of the Australian Fish Names Standard. While this current publication links each standard name with its scientific name (and authority) and its Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota (CAAB) code, work remains to present the list in a more user-friendly, visually sympathetic, and searchable manner. Necessary enhancements, which are required sooner rather than later, include the incorporation of obsolete names and species images. The inclusion of distribution maps and user-friendly diagnostic characters to identify species would also improve its utility. Such improvements, especially if available both in hardcopy and online, would provide widely accessible and highly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/yearsleygk_2006a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fjFNQ799TtIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
