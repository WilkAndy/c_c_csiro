Body entirely naked above and below, without dermal denticles or thorns. Trunk depressed and flattened, not shark-like. Precaudal tail moderately depressed, usually with variously developed lateral ridges on sides, tail abruptly narrower than trunk; no barbed sting (stinger or stinging spine) on dorsal surface of tail behind dorsal fins, no electric organs in tail. Head broad and depressed; snout moderately elongated, broadly rounded or obtusely rounded-angular; snout supported by large, anteriorly extended rostral cartilage and by anterolaterally expanded antorbital cartilages; rostral cartilage projecting forward towards snout tip in a straight line or at a slight angle; snout not formed into a rostral saw and without lateral saw teeth. Five small gill openings on underside of front half of pectoral-fin bases, not visible in lateral view; no gill sieves or rakers on internal gills. Eyes dorsolateral on head and just anterior and partly medial to spiracles. Spiracles with or without small papillae; when papillae are present these are never elongated; spiracles without elevated rims or with small rims; spiracles circular to oval in shape. Mouth transverse and straight, without prominent knobs and depressions but with strong labial folds and a prominent groove around its periphery. Nostrils just anterior to mouth and separated from it by much less than the space between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.fao.org/3/x2401e/x2401e05.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a6VCST9Sw8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
