Indonesian fisheries represent about 10% of the world\u2019s catch of elasmobranchs and about a third of this (about 10 000 to 25 000 t annually between 1976 and 1990) are rays. Stingrays are the dominant ray components of the catch. Most species are used but information on the relative importance of each on a regional basis is poor. Stingrays are inadequately represented in museum collections because the adults of many species are large, and thus difficult to transport and store. Additional collections and further research is required to resolve nomenclatural problems and better define distributions of most species in this region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.fao.org/3/x2401e/x2401e09.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M_zgF7byRrkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
