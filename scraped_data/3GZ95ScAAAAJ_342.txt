Although there was some discussion about what characterized middle-sized fish, the meeting included papers on everything from anchovies to tunas, by way of mackerels, sardines, herrings, frigate mackerels, horse mackerels and dolphin fish. The key adaptation of the pelagic niche was mobility to exploit high plankton production, or to feed on fish that did this, and there was recognition of adaptations for high mobility such as warm bloodedness, and of batch spawning to ensure persistence in volatile ocean regions. There were formal sessions on biology, behaviour, ecology, environmental change, abundance fluctuations, exploitation and management. We heard about simulation models of tuna schooling behaviour, remote sensing of sea-surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00044131", "cites_per_year": {}}
