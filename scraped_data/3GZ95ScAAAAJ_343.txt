Most records include catch composition by species (presence/absence but not weight), also some data on length frequency, maturity and diet of commercially important species. The data were obtained by exchange with Soviet scientists in the mid 1990s and has had CSIRO species codes incorporated. The dataset is now in an Oracle database in Hobart, and analyses/summaries of the data are given in the accompanying report (see References). A MS Access version of the dataset has been compiled for use within the North West Shelf-JEMS study. This version is available on-line for researchers in the NWS-JEMS study (see \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9830189916972219448&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
