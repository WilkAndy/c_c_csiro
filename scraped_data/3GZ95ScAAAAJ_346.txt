Deruygin December 1975-May 1976", "citation": "", "author": "Tony Koslow and Peter Last and Alan Williams and Paul Sabourenkov", "abstract": "This dataset comprises catch compositions and trawl locations from a cruise of the Russian fishery research vessel\" Pr. Deruygin\" carried out in Australian waters between December 1975 and May 1976, containing 14 demersal trawls from the Tasman Sea, off SE Tasmania, and the Australian North West Shelf. Most records include catch composition by species (presence/absence but not weight), also some data on length frequency, maturity and diet of commercially important species. The data were obtained by exchange with Soviet scientists in the mid 1990s and has had CSIRO species codes incorporated. The dataset is now in an Oracle database in Hobart, and analyses/summaries of the data are given in the accompanying report (see References). A MS Access version of the dataset has been compiled for use within the North West Shelf-JEMS study. This version is available on-line for researchers in the NWS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7797530416919156422&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
