It holds information on taxonomic identity of specimens, and collection details. Materials come from community studies and findings, fishers, and expeditions and cruises on CSIRO survey and research vessels, notably Fairwind (Papua New Guinea region, 1948-1950), Stanley Fowler (tropical Australia, 1948-1950), Rama (Gulf of Carpentaria, 1963-1965), Courageous (1975-1979), Soela (1979-1989) and Southern Surveyor (1990 to present). While the largest part of the collection is from Australian waters, there are also collections from Papua New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, Solomon Islands \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7200477459991614304&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
