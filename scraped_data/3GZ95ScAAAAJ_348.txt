It encompasses all of Australia's commercial seafood species, and contains the only photographs in existence of many bycatch species. It contains images of species from rivers and estuaries, from near-shore to the deep ocean, from the temperate regions to the tropics, as well as from remote offshore islands and the sub-Antarctic. CSIRO marine scientists have assembled PIAF over the last 30 years as a by-product of coastal and deep ocean surveys.
