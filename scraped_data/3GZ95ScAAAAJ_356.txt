Body entirely naked above and below, without dermal denticles or thorns. Trunk depressed and flattened, not shark-like. Precaudal tail slightly depressed, with or without lateral ridges on sides, tail abruptly narrower than trunk, no barbed sting (stinger or stinging spine) on dorsal surface of tail, no electric organs in tail. Head broad and depressed; snout moderately elongated, broadly rounded; snout supported by a narrow, slender, rod-like rostral cartilage and by the anteriorly expanded antorbital cartilages; not formed into a rostral saw and without lateral saw teeth. Five small gill openings on underside of front half of pectoral-fin bases, not visible in lateral view; no gill sieves or rakers on internal gill slits. Eyes dorsolateral on head and anterior and partly medial to spiracles, moderately large to vestigial or absent externally. Mouth transverse, straight, and very narrow, without prominent knobs and depressions but with strong labial folds and a weak groove around its periphery. Nostrils just anterior to mouth and separated from it by much less than their own widths, connected by broad nasoral grooves with mouth; anterior nasal flaps long and medially expanded and fused into a narrow nasal curtain that overlaps mouth. Oral teeth small, rounded-oval in shape and with a transverse low ridge or single cusps on their crowns, not laterally expanded and plate-like, similar in shape and in less than 25 rows in either jaw. Pectoral fins originating at anterior edges of snout lateral to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.fao.org/3/x2401e/x2401e06.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:riWcj5NctxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
