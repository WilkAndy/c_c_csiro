Most records include catch composition by species (presence/absence but not weight), also some data on length frequency, maturity and diet of commercially important species. The data were obtained by exchange with Soviet scientists in the mid 1990s and has had CSIRO species codes incorporated. The dataset is now in an Oracle database in Hobart, and analyses/summaries of the data are given in the accompanying report (see References). Please note, according to the report there are only 29 trawls from this voyage from January 1978 only, however in the actual dataset there are 45 trawls \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1514905254969680284&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
