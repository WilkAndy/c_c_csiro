Deruygin January-May 1977", "citation": "", "author": "Tony Koslow and Peter Last and Alan Williams and Paul Sabourenkov", "abstract": "This dataset comprises catch compositions and trawl locations from a cruise of the Russian fishery research vessel\" Pr. Deruygin\" carried out in Australian waters between January and May 1977, containing 29 demersal trawls from the Tasman Sea, off SE Tasmania, and off NW Western Australia. Most records include catch composition by species (presence/absence but not weight), also some data on length frequency, maturity and diet of commercially important species. The data were obtained by exchange with Soviet scientists in the mid 1990s and has had CSIRO species codes incorporated. The dataset is now in an Oracle database in Hobart, and analyses/summaries of the data are given in the accompanying report (see References). A MS Access version of the dataset has been compiled for use within the North West Shelf-JEMS study. This version is available on-line for researchers in the NWS-JEMS study \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1313224766659961265&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
