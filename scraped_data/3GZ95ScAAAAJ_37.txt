Molecular studies using mitochondrial and nuclear markers with dense taxon sampling corroborate that the skates consist of four main family-level groups, ie Anacanthobatidae, Arhynchobatidae, Gurgesiellidae and Rajidae. The Rays of the World book followed this subdivision of skates resulting in several nomenclatural decisions at both supraspecific and species levels, which are described and discussed in the present paper. These nomenclatural changes include: 1) resurrection of the family Gurgesiellidae, comprising all eight species of Cruriraja, eight species of Fenestraja and three species of Gurgesiella; 2) supraspecific changes to anacanthobatid nomenclature, ie elevation of subgenus Schroederobatis to generic level and resurrection of Springeria from subgeneric rank as a valid genus-level taxon; 3) provisional assignment of members of two undefined genus-level taxa, the \u201cNorth Pacific Assemblage\u201d and the \u201cAmphi-American Assemblage\u201d; 4) reassignment of species to the genus Dentiraja; 5) resurrection of Dipturus intermedius as a valid species from synonymy with D. batis; 6) resurrection of the tribe Pavorajini McEachran, 1984; and 7) erection of two new tribes, Bathyrajini (type genus Bathyraja) and Crurirajini (type genus Cruriraja). Furthermore, an annotated checklist of rajiform species is provided to explain major nomenclatural changes and place the list in context with other contemporary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15621703395862597849", "cites_id": ["15621703395862597849"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei-Yang-29/publication/311043869_Changes_to_the_nomenclature_of_the_skates_Chondrichthyes_Rajiformes/links/583f778608ae2d217557e695/Changes-to-the-nomenclature-of-the-skates-Chondrichthyes-Rajiformes.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2VDnoHhwy9gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
