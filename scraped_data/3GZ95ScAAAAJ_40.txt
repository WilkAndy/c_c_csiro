The species, known locally as the Maugean Skate, has been assessed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals based on its rarity and very narrow geographic range. It is also one of the few skates worldwide to occur mainly in brackish water. The Maugean Skate belongs to a group of anatomically conservative, Dipturus-like skates conforming to the currently unrecognized genus Zearaja Whitley. This ancient group, with a Gondwanan lineage possibly dating back to the Cretaceous, contains at least two other species: Z. nasuta from New Zealand and Z. chilensis from South America. The skeletal morphologies of the Zearaja species are compared with typical Dipturus skates and their phylogenetic position discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16926261720904926787", "cites_id": ["16926261720904926787"], "pub_url": "http://ifop-bevan.pbworks.com/f/Zearaja+maugeana+Last+%26+Gledhill+2007.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q4bUIVsp5uoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
