Trunk moderately depressed, thick and shark-like. Precaudal tail moderately depressed, with lateral ridges on sides, tail not abruptly narrower than trunk, no barbed sting (stinger or stinging spine) on dorsal surface of tail behind dorsal fins and no electric organs in tail. Head narrow, but moderately depressed; snout supported by a stout rostral cartilage, greatly elongated into a flat, narrow blade or rostral saw with a single row of large, transverse teeth on each side that grow continuously from their bases; saw without small teeth or paired dermal barbels on its underside and without smaller teeth between the large ones on its sides; posteriormost rostral teeth well anterior to nostrils. Five small gill slits on underside of front half of pectoral-fin bases, not visible in lateral view; no gill sieves or rakers on internal gill slits. Eyes dorsolateral on head and well anterior to spiracles. Mouth transverse and straight, without knobs and depressions. Nostrils well anterior and completely separated from mouth, far apart from each other and not connected to the mouth by nasoral grooves; anterior nasal flaps short, not connected with each other and not reaching mouth. Oral teeth very small, rounded-oval in shape and without cusps on their crowns, not laterally expanded and plate-like, similar in shape and in 60 or more rows in either jaw.
