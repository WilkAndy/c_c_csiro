Exploratory fishing surveys in previously unexplored regions have led to the discovery of many new taxa. Almost 1170 species are known to occur worldwide, of which slightly more than 1000 have been formally described since the first chondrichthyans were described by Linnaeus in 1758 (Fig. 1). About 370 species, or more than a third of the world\u2019s known chondrichthyan fauna, have been described or discovered in the last 30 years. An increasing awareness of the role of chondrichthyan fishes as apical predators in marine ecosystems, serious conservation concerns for these fishes, which are now widely considered to be amongst the most vulnerable of all marine animals, and a need to understand and manage marine biodiversity, has greatly elevated their profile in recent times. Results from the IUCN Shark Specialist Group\u2019s Red List assessments indicate that commercially exploited species of deep sea sharks have amongst the highest risk of extinction of any marine taxa (IUCN 2006).
