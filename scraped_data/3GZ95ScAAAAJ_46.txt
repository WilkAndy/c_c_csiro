C) is formally named and described based on 16 specimens collected from heavy tidal zones and rivers in northern Australia (Western Australia and Northern Territory) and Papua New Guinea. Glyphis garricki differs from its congeners by a combination of dentition, vertebral counts, morphometrics and coloration. It is compared closely to the morphologically similar Glyphis glyphis (formerly Glyphis sp. A) that has a similar range. Comparison of the stuffed holotype of Carcharias (Prionodon) glyphis with specimens of Glyphis sp. A from northern Australia and Papua New Guinea suggests that they are conspecific, and a redescription of Glyphis glyphis is provided based on all of these specimens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13041915350678871701", "cites_id": ["13041915350678871701"], "pub_url": "http://bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/1833-2331/22/205.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lZ7tk-kw_rQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
