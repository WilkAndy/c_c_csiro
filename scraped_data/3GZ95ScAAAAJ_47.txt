Neotrygon leylandi, N. kuhlii and N. annotata have previously been placed in the widespread genus Dasyatis by most authors, but recent morphological and molecular studies have shown that these species are not congeneric with Dasyatis. Members of this genus are characterised by a mask-shaped colour pattern around the eyes, a long and narrow internasal curtain, and a short tail that is variably banded apically, and has well-developed dorsal and ventral skin folds. A new maskray, Neotrygon picta sp. nov., is described from material collected off tropical northern and northeastern Australia. This species was initially thought to be a colour variant of another Australian maskray, Neotrygon leylandi, from off northwestern Australia, but recent molecular analysis and morphometric and meristic investigation has shown that the two are specifically distinct."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10736937110100915743", "cites_id": ["10736937110100915743"], "pub_url": "http://bionames.org/bionames-archive/issn/1833-2331/22/315.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HzZGN2pDAZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
