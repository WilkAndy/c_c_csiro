As a joint management area, activities such as commercial fishing and traditional hunting occur with primary natural resource conservation goals. Managers need information on habitats and biodiversity distribution and risks to ensure these activities are conducted sustainably. However, while broad seabed habitat information was available for much of the TSPZ from past projects, there were significant gaps and very limited species level data. From 2003 to 2006, the Torres Strait Mapping and Characterisation Project has mapped habitats and their associated biodiversity across the length and breadth of the Protected Zone to provide information that will help managers with regional planning and to ensure that fisheries are ecologically sustainable, as required by environmental protection legislation.  Comprehensive information on the biodiversity of the seabed was acquired by visiting almost 200 sites, representing a wide range of known environments, during two 1-month-long voyages on two vessels and deploying several types of devices such as: towed video and digital cameras, an epibenthic sled and a research trawl to collect samples for more detailed data about plants, invertebrates and fishes on the seabed. Data were collected and processed from ~100 km of towed video and >10,000 photos, and from sorting and identification of ~2,000 benthic samples, ~1,200 seabed fish samples, and ~200 sediment samples. The project has analysed this information and produced all of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11604222788962304978", "cites_id": ["11604222788962304978"], "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/39905", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0kOXDiV7CqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
