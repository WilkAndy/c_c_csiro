Trunk thick, slightly flattened and shark-like. Precaudal tail moderately depressed, with lateral ridges on sides, tail not abruptly narrower than trunk, no barbed sting (stinger or stinging spine) on dorsal surface of tail behind dorsal fins, no electric organs in tail. Head narrow to broad and moderately depressed; snout short to moderately elongated, bluntly rounded or angular; snout supported by a stout rostral cartilage; snout not formed into a rostral saw and without lateral saw teeth. Five small gill openings on underside of front half of pectoral-fin bases, not visible in lateral view; no gill sieves or rakers on internal gill slits. Eyes dorsolateral on head and just anterior to spiracles. Mouth more or less arched and with prominent knobs and depressions. Nostrils somewhat anterior to mouth and separated from it by less than their own widths, always separate from each other and mouth; anterior nasal flaps short, not connected with each other and not reaching mouth. Oral teeth small to moderately large, rounded-oval in shape and without cusps on their crowns, not laterally expanded and plate-like, similar in shape and in 32 to 76 rows in either jaw. Pectoral fins small, originating in front of mouth but behind nostrils, attached to postrostral head and ending anterior to pelvic-fin origins. No large electric organs at bases of pectoral fins.
