Occurrences of 3734 species in eight depth\u2010stratified bathomes (from the coast to the mid\u2010continental slope) within each province were analysed to determine the structure and local affinities of their assemblages and their association with faunas of nearby regions and oceans basins.Results\u2002 Strong geographic and depth\u2010related structure was evident. Fish assemblages in each province, and in each bathome of each province, were distinct, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7187281465505409054", "cites_id": ["7187281465505409054"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02484.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HugyvGlavmMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
