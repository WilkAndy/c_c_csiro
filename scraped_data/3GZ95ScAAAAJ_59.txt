Port Davey and associated Bathurst Harbour in south\u2010western Tasmania represent one of the world's most anomalous estuarine systems owing to an unusual combination of environmental factors. These include: (i) large uninhabited catchment protected as a National Park; (ii) ria geomorphology but with fjord characteristics that include a shallow entrance and deep 12\u2010km long channel connecting an almost land\u2010locked harbour to the sea; (iii) high rainfall and riverine input that generate strongly\u2010stratified estuarine conditions, with a low\u2010salinity surface layer and marine bottom water; (iv) a deeply tannin\u2010stained surface layer that blocks light penetration to depth; (v) very low levels of nutrients and low aquatic productivity; (vi) weak tidal influences; (vii) marine bottom water with stable temperature throughout the year; (viii) numerous endemic species; (ix) strongly depth\u2010stratified benthic assemblages exhibiting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13650505150178797313", "cites_id": ["13650505150178797313"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.1079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AScMURxWcL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
