Some 3,365 species of marine fishes are recorded from the area. The inshore fishes may have been relatively well-studied, but the pelagic and deep sea fauna is not, as are small fishes which inhabit reefs at depths beyond the reach of SCUBA divers. These deep sea habitats are identified as important areas for future exploration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 422, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9646612488557488440,57960780101433665", "cites_id": ["9646612488557488440", "57960780101433665"], "pub_url": "https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/app/uploads/2017/04/s08rbz569-667.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OOlQyvKm34UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 12, "2004": 9, "2005": 4, "2006": 15, "2007": 15, "2008": 22, "2009": 5, "2010": 21, "2011": 21, "2012": 20, "2013": 23, "2014": 27, "2015": 27, "2016": 36, "2017": 23, "2018": 26, "2019": 26, "2020": 25, "2021": 25, "2022": 23, "2023": 9}}
