Surveys funded by Australian and Japanese agencies in the 1990s have significantly changed this impression. At least 7 species from the families Carcharhinidae, Pristidae, Rajidae and Dasyatidae, are now thought to be obligate within these habitats, while many others breed or occur seasonally in estuaries. Our understanding of their biology remains poor and this may have serious conservation consequences. The undescribed Bizant river shark, Glyphis sp., which is known from only two specimens taken more than 15 years ago, may now be extinct. The freshwater sawfish, Pristis microdon, appears to be restricted to freshwater. This species, which is Australia's largest freshwater fish, is taken in the dry season from waterholes by gill nets and its numbers appear to be declining. So serious is this situation, that this species may be eliminated from the region before its biology is understood. Similarly, an undescribed skate Dipturus sp. confined to two Tasmanian estuaries is the world's only known obligate estuarine skate. Once again, little is known of its life history but its small population and extremely restricted range make it highly vulnerable to extirpation. Conservation issues applying to Australian elasmobranchs also apply elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5988806745345832122", "cites_id": ["5988806745345832122"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dhpCGFohjjcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA185&dq=info:ujTNPAGEHFMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=iGPkh4rUbu&sig=_XSeOBeFAwzLwnlA8RqLfjBXFSw", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ujTNPAGEHFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
