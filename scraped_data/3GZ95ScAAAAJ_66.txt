Mustelus widodoi sp. nov. is known from the continental shelf of eastern Indonesia (Jimbaran Bay, Bali) at depths of 60 to 120 m. Mustelus ravidus sp. nov. occurs on the continental shelf of Western Australia at depths of 106 to 300 m. These two new species differ from other Australian and Indonesia M ustelus species in having the palatine processes of the palatoquadrates subdivided at the symphysis with a short, separate medial segment on each side, and the lower labial furrows subequal to or longer than the upper furrows. Mustelus griseus Pietschmann, from Japan, also shares these characteristics but differs from the two new species by having much lower precaudal vertebral counts. M ustelus widodoi and M. ravidus are similar species which are clearly separated by differences in morphometrics and slight diff e rences in vertebral counts and coloration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1927574444166308935", "cites_id": ["1927574444166308935"], "pub_url": "http://sfi-cybium.fr/sites/default/files/pdfs-cybium/07.White368.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R2Snhr4ewBoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
