Four new specimens are recorded: Somniosus rostratus from New Zealand and S. pacificus from south of Tasmania, and New Zealand. Comparative material was examined and the specimens were identified on the basis of morphometrics, tooth shape and number, and dermal denticles. Photographs of two further specimens from New Zealand were also examined, but the species were not determined. Southern hemisphere Somniosus are represented by S. pacificus and S. rostratus. A revised key to the genus is presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10742119609429545214", "cites_id": ["10742119609429545214"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.1988.9516311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_lDO3t6sE5UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 6, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
