It belongs to a subgroup of Himantura species provisionally defined herein as the\" uarnacoides\" complex that includes five nominal species: H. chaophraya, H. granulata, H. hortlei, H. pastinacoides, and H. uarnacoides. These whiprays all have a similar lateral disc shape (ie, pectoral-fin apices broadly rounded rather than narrowly rounded or angular), a plain colouration (ie, usually uniform light to dark brown dorsally, and pale or whitish ventrally with or without a dark margin), a long and slender whiplike tail, and platelike denticles in a broad dorsal band in adults. Himantura lobistoma can be distinguished from the superficially similar H. hortlei by its highly protrusible mouth and pelvic girdle with prominent lateral prepelvic processes.
