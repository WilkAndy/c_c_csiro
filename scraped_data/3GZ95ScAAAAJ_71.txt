Himantura randalli sp. nov. isdistinguished from these species by a combination of characters, ie disc shape, morphometrics, squamation (includingits rapid denticle development and denticle band shape), plain dorsal disc coloration, and whitish saddles on a dark tail inyoung. It is a medium-sized whipray with a maximum confirmed size of 620 mm disc width (DW) and a birth size ofaround 150\u2013170 mm DW. Males mature at approximately 400 mm DW.
