Faunal lists were compiled from six geographical regions with species from these regions assigned to distributional classes and broad habitat categories. Australian species were further classified on provincial and bathomic structure following bioregionalization outputs from regional marine planning. About 40% of the world's chondrichthyan fauna occurs in Indo\u2010Australasia (482 species) of which 323 species are found in Australian seas. The tropical Australian component, of which c. 46% of taxa are regional endemics, is most similar to faunas of Indonesia, New Guinea and New Caledonia. The temperate Australian component is most similar to New Zealand and Antarctica with about half of its species endemic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9477012818209145334", "cites_id": ["9477012818209145334"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.03095.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9gEuYfIchYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
