A total of 348 demersal fish species in 99 families, which were collected from 135 samples taken with a variety of sampling gear, greatly improved taxonomic knowledge of this poorly known area. Twenty five percent of the fish sampled are considered to be potentially new species. Relatively high levels of regional endemicity and diversity are attributed to geological history, and the complexity of contemporary climatology, hydrography and habitat diversity of the region. Fish assemblages were highly structured by depth, but across regions, deep-water fish faunas showed stronger taxonomic affinities than shallower faunas. Although less pronounced, spatial differences pointed towards distinct faunas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12603813525394299194", "cites_id": ["12603813525394299194"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510003486", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OhlknJ-96a4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
