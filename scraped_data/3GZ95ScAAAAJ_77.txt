Of the three subgroups of Rhinobatos occurring in the Indian Ocean, it most closely conforms with the subgenus Rhinobatos (Linnaeus). A small species, known only from the holotype, it is unique within the family in having an almost completely naked dorsal surface. In addition, it is further distinguished from other Indo-Pacific members of the genus by the combination of a pale, plain-colored disc, large eyes, the inner edge of the anterior nasal flap penetrating slightly into the internarial space, low dorsal fins, a long pelvic-fin inner margin, a narrow interdorsal space, two spiracular folds, an elongate to oval-shaped denticle patch on the caudal peduncle, and a small, weakly asymmetrical caudal fin."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12766008059261450407", "cites_id": ["12766008059261450407"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10228-004-0211-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p3gNVLH4KbEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
