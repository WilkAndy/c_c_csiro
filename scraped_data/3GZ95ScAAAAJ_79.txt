A second spotted handfish of the genus Brachionichthys was first identified in the early 1980\u2019s and is formally described based on material from southern Australia. Brachionichthys australis sp. nov. differs from its close congener B. hirsutus, in having a larger eye, longer illicium with a smaller esca, longer first dorsal-fin ray, fewer second dorsal-fin rays, shorter second dorsal-fin base, and a more subtle colour pattern. It also has a sparse covering of long, thin streaks and stripes (rather than small spots or short streaks), and the caudal fin is sparsely spotted (densely covered with fine spots that usually form a dark submarginal bar in B. hirsutus). They can also be distinguished using molecular analysis.
