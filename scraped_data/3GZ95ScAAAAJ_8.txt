Conservation of estuarine biodiversity requires recognition that different estuary types are subjected to particular types and levels of human impact. To protect assemblages associated with all estuary types in Tasmania, Australia, the conservation significance of the 111 large- and moderate-size estuaries in the island state were assessed by firstly categorising estuaries into nine groups on the basis of similarities in physical attributes. These attributes were quantified using GIS maps of estuaries and their catchments and field-collected data, with separation of groups primarily reflecting presence of a seaward barrier, tidal range, salinity, estuary size and river runoff. The adequacy of the physical groups as surrogates for biological patterns was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 310, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=656584889809610412", "cites_id": ["656584889809610412"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320799001111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rKb9gXqoHAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 7, "2004": 9, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 11, "2008": 10, "2009": 20, "2010": 15, "2011": 30, "2012": 14, "2013": 22, "2014": 14, "2015": 15, "2016": 14, "2017": 20, "2018": 21, "2019": 12, "2020": 12, "2021": 14, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
