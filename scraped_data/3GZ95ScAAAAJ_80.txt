All but three of these species occur in the seas off Tasmania. The group is comprised of two recognised genera, Brachionichthys Bleeker and Sympterichthys Gill, and three new genera, Brachiopsilus gen. nov., Pezichthys gen. nov. and Thymichthys gen. nov. Nine of the 14 species are undescribed. The type genus, Brachionichthys, consists of B. hirsutus (Lacep\u00e8de) and B. australis Last, Gledhill & Holmes. These species, which are covered with long, unicuspid spinules and a strong colour pattern of dark spots and streaks, typically have 7 pectoral-fin rays. The genus Sympterichthys includes one of Australia\u2019s earliest described fishes, S. unipennis (Cuvier), and a new taxon S. moultoni sp. nov. Members of the genus lack warts and dermal appendages on the skin but are covered in small embedded scales with adpressed, unicuspid and bicuspid spinules originating from the posterior margin of their bases. Brachiopsilus contains three new species: B. dianthus sp. nov., B. dossenus sp. nov. and B. ziebelli sp. nov. These handfishes, which are amongst the largest members of the family (reaching 117 mm SL), are smooth skinned (without spinules, dermal appendages or fleshy warts), are vividly coloured in life (without extensive blackish markings), and have 9\u201310 pectoral-fin rays. A fourth genus, Pezichthys, is not fully resolved and may be polyphyletic. It provisionally consists of five undescribed species: P. amplispinus sp. nov., P. compressus sp. nov., P. eltanini sp. nov., P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1766013937352956653", "cites_id": ["1766013937352956653"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2252.1.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7dpPvFEkghgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
