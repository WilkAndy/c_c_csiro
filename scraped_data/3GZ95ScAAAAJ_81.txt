Hemigaleus australiensis n. sp. is known from the insular and continental shelves of northern Australia from inshore bays to depths of 170 m. The new species differs from the only other member of this genus, Hemigaleus microstoma, in having substantially lower vertebral counts, much higher tooth counts in lower jaw, and a black-tipped second dorsal fin. Hemigaleus australiensis and H. microstoma are also readily separated by differences in morphometrics and sizes at birth and maturity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4237396027401064361", "cites_id": ["4237396027401064361"], "pub_url": "https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/1015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qU_keTxBzjoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
