Environmental characteristics of this zone were described and a classification of habitats was proposed. Three broadly defined soft bottom environments were identified. The first, a closed and semi-closed esturine environment, contained a complex of habitats including coastal lakes, bar-dammed lagoons and rivers and beach-dammed lagoons. A second type of environment consisted of a range of estuarine systems, such as open lagoons, bay estuaries, tidal rivers and tidal creeks, that are permanently open to the sea. Beach habitats comprised the final environment type and these varied in their exposure to wave action from sheltered to exposed. In general, most habitat types were found to be geographically variable and highly complex which stemmed mainly from regionally differing climatic factors, tidal regimes and degrees of wave exposure.  Soft-bottom habitats did not represent clearly defined biotopes for fish. Instead the 125 species collected in daytime samples were assembled into 4 community types: a coastal freshwater assemblage; an estuarine assemblage; a sheltered beach assemblage; and an exposed beach assemblage. Some species occurred in more than one of these and 7 species were ubiquitous to all four. Compositional variations within each community type and their interactions with changes in substrate, tidal state and salinity were also examined.  The community structures and habitat usages of fishes from two estuaries were examined in detail.
