The group presently contains six species: Brochiraja asperula (Garrick & Paul), B. spinifera (Garrick & Paul), and four new taxa, B albilabiata sp. nov., B. aenigma sp. nov., B. leviveneta sp. nov., and B. microspinifera sp. nov. These species are closely related to members of the Indo\u2010Pacific genus Notoraja but three of them differ from all other softnose skates (arhynchobatins) in at least one presumed synaphomorphy\u2014the presence of a bifurcated thorn on the mid\u2010distal rostral cartilage that is strongly evident in juveniles and variably reduced in adults. Placement of B. aenigma, known only from the post\u2010juvenile holotype, lacks these thorns so its placement in the genus is provisional. The new species differ from B. asperula, B. spinifera, and each other, in coloration, morphometrics, squamation, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3706606681127720563", "cites_id": ["3706606681127720563"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00288330.2006.9517404", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cxa1ViODcDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
