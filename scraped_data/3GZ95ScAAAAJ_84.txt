It is a rarely seen, cryptic, nocturnal species that lives deeply concealed in crevices and caves during the day. In external appearance, Halaphritis superficially resembles the parapatric, monotypic pseudaphritid, Pseudaphritis urvillii (Valenciennes), an estuarine and freshwater species that is among the most primitive extant notothenioid fishes. Based on osteology, dentition, and fin and sensory canal structures, Halaphritis is provisionally included in the temperate marine family Bovichtidae. In addition to its unique character mix, Halaphritis can be distinguished from confamilial genera by having a rounded caudal fin, unbranched pectoral fin rays and strongly protruding, dorsally directed eyes.
