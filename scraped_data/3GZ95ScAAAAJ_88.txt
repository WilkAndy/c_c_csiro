F ve of these spec es, Dipturus canutus sp. nov.(southeastern and southern Austral a), D. confusus sp. nov.(southeastern Austral a), D. falloargus sp. nov.(northwestern Austral a), D. grahami sp. nov.(eastern Austral a) and D. oculus sp. nov.(southwestern Australia), were identified and treated a decade ago in a comprehensive guide to the shark and ray fauna of Austral a.
