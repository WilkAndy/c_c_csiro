Based on a small number of examples (rare birds, frogs, and a few plants), the authors concluded that collection of voucher specimens is potentially harmful to many species, and that alternatives\u2014photographs, audio recordings and nonlethal tissue sampling for DNA analysis\u2014are sufficient to document biological diversity. The isolated examples that Minteer et al. cited to demonstrate the negative impact of scientific collecting have been carefully analyzed, and none of these extinction events can be attributed to that cause (1\u20133).
