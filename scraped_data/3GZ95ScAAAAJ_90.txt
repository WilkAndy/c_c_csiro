Orectolobus floridus sp. nov., which has a striking colour pattern of yellowish brown bands, blotches, spots and reticulations, occurs between Geraldton and Augusta at depths of 42\u201385 m. Orectolobus parvimaculatus sp. nov., another small, colourful wobbegong shark, which is sympatric with O. floridus and three other congeners, has been confused with a larger, more widespread wobbegong, O. maculatus. Orectolobus parvimaculatus occurs between Green Head and Mandurah at depths of 9\u2013108 m. The new species differ from other Orectolobus species and each other by a combination of colour, morphology, body measurements and meristics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1450189861242221165", "cites_id": ["1450189861242221165"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.1673.1.2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bTI30P4bIBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
