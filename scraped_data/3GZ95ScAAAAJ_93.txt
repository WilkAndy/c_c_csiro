CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, Hobart, Tasmania", "pages": "55-69", "abstract": "A new spurdog, Squalus chloroculus sp. nov, is described based on specimens from the upper continental slope off southern Australia. This species and a closely related Indo-West Pacific species, S. montalbani Whitley, have been consistently confused with each other and misidentified as a western North Pacific spurdog, S. mitsukurii Jordan and Snyder. In this paper, the new species is described and Squalus montalbani is resurrected and rediagnosed based on material from the Philippines, Indonesia, and tropical and warm temperate Australia. Intraspecific variation between populations of S. montalbani across these regions is discussed. These species are compared to S. mitsukurii and belong to a subgroup of Squalus, the \u201cmitsukurii group\", whose members have a moderately elongate snout, stocky body, and a dark caudal bar on the posterior notch of the caudal fin. These spurdogs are very similar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14611866792434581246", "cites_id": ["14611866792434581246"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-White-32/publication/235659643_Part_6_-_A_description_of_Squalus_chloroculus_sp_nov_a_new_spurdog_from_southern_Australia_and_the_resurrection_of_S_montalbani_Whitley/links/0c960534494627cd4d000000/Part-6-A-description-of-Squalus-chloroculus-sp-nov-a-new-spurdog-from-southern-Australia-and-the-resurrection-of-S-montalbani-Whitley.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_r5jRG7Hx8oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
