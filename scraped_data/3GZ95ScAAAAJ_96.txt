The new species, which have been confused with H. boesemani (western North Pacific) and H. buergeri (northwestern Indian Ocean), have a colour pattern consisting of dark bars and dark spots but differ from these species by a combination of coloration, morphometrics, and meristics. These species differ from southern African endemics, H. lineatus and H. natalensis, in having a snout tip that is rounded rather than upturned. A related catshark Halaelurus quagga, from the northwestern Indian Ocean, has a colour pattern consisting of more numerous dark bars without spots."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3GZ95ScAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1845139846251444771", "cites_id": ["1845139846251444771"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.1639.1.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I3q8COpAmxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
