A number of important themes have emerged: Warming over many land areas is greater than global annual mean warming due to less water availability for evaporative cooling and a smaller thermal inertia as compared to the oceans; Warming generally increases the spatial variability of precipitation, contributing to a reduction of rainfall in the subtropics and an increase at higher latitudes and in parts of the tropics. The precise location of boundaries between regions of robust increase and decrease remains uncertain and this is commonly where Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) projections disagree; The poleward expansion of the subtropical highs, combined with the general tendency towards reductions in subtropical precipitation, creates especially robust projections of a reduction in precipitation at the poleward edges of the subtropics. Most of the regional projections of reductions in precipitation in the 21st century are associated with areas adjacent to these subtropical highs; There is a tendency for monsoonal circulations to result in increased precipitation due to enhanced moisture convergence, despite a tendency towards weakening of the monsoonal flows themselves. However, many aspects of tropical climatic responses remain uncertain. Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models remain the primary source of regional information on the range of possible future climates.
