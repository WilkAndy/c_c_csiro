Their work, and subsequent work by Hirst and Linacre (1978), established that a relationship existed between warm SST anomalies off the coast of New South Wales and increased rainfall at coast\u00e4l stations. Later, Streten (1981, 1983) demonstrated that wet years over the Australian continent were associated with warmer than nor-mal SST in tropical latitudes in the Australian region, and that in dry years these waters were cool. The relationship of SST in this area to.
