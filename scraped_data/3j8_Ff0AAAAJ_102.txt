In particular, there may be a reduction in areas suitable for growing stone-and pome-fruit varieties that require chilling, and an expansion in areas suitable for growing subtropical crops. Changes in rainfall and evaporation are likely to reduce soil moisture and runoff. Increased crop water demand combined with reduced water supply poses significant challenges. Efficient water use will become paramount. Lower winter and spring rainfall may indirectly cause increased frost risk. Increased temperatures will advance phenology (timing of crop developmental stages) with likely effects on flowering, pollination and harvest dates. Warmer temperatures may also increase sunburn incidence and reduce colour development. Also of concern for vegetable growers is a potential increase in premature flowering (bolting). For some perennial horticultural crops increased night-time temperatures will lead to increased respiration and thus affect the distribution of assimilates to reproductive sinks. It may be more difficult to obtain desired fruit size classes. Varietal selection can be used to match crops to new climate regimes. Utilising existing varieties or breeding new varieties can facilitate adaptation. For example, drought-tolerant plants for amenity horticulture (parks and gardens) will be favoured in a drier climate. The net effect of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is crop-specific. Elevated concentrations can enhance photosynthesis and water use efficiency in some plants. There are likely to be changes in the nitrogen status of horticultural crops as CO 2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10540673297716770540", "cites_id": ["10540673297716770540"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103078926", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7Hbac4T-R5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
