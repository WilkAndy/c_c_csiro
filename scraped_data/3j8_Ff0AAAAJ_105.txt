This is the final report of a three year consultancy (1994-97) with the Governments of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland.Five climatic aspects are assessed:(1) the interaction between the monsoon, tropical cyclones, the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and variations within the monsoon season,(2) the ability of regional and global climate models to simulate present-day and future climates,(3) the behaviour of the ENSO phenomenon under enhanced greenhouse conditions,(4) changes in extreme events including tropical cyclones, and (5) potential impacts of climate change and identification of future research projects of an applied nature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=522123678988536626,9720185104522214611", "cites_id": ["522123678988536626", "9720185104522214611"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/suppiah_1998a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MovuPrj0PgcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
