The analysis in WR included, as an important step, tests for relationships between the eastern hemisphere proxy rainfall series under consideration, and the E1 Nifio chronology of Quinn and Neal (1992). The E1 Nifio chronology is based primarily on historical records of coastal flooding and heavy rain in Peru (although some additional evidence is drawn from Chile and Brazil). For this note, revision of some of the analysis of WR has been undertaken using the revised E1 Nifio chronology of Quinn (1992). The results of these calculations, which are summarised in this note, suggest some conclusions significantly different from those drawn in WR, and also have implications for the correct interpretation of the Quinn (1992) E1 Nifio chronology.The data used in WR included annual time series of flood height of the Nile at Cairo, an index of rainfall in northern China (which was based on historical records) and tree ring widths based on teak growing in Java. In addition, WR used two extreme event chronologies: a drought and famine chronology for India, and the E1 Nifio chronology prepared by Quinn and Neal (1992). All of these series began at least as early as 1525 (the first year analysed), although there were some long breaks in the Nile record prior to 1700. The four eastern hemisphere series are proxies for rainfall variations in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9041741564527404667", "cites_id": ["9041741564527404667"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42762950/Historical_ENSO_teleconnections_in_the_E20160217-12550-1iu4xfc.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e2aKOAy4en0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
