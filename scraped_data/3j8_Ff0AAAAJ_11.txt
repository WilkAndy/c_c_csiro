It builds upon past IPCC assessments and incorporates new findings from the past six years of research. Scientific progress since the Third Assessment Report (TAR) is based upon large amounts of new and more comprehensive data, more sophisticated analyses of data, improvements in understanding of processes and their simulation in models and more extensive exploration of uncertainty ranges. The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections specified in curly brackets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 312, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11589271043484946092", "cites_id": ["11589271043484946092"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-03334554/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rA6kiJxc1aAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 22, "2009": 25, "2010": 35, "2011": 20, "2012": 26, "2013": 25, "2014": 25, "2015": 20, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 23, "2022": 23, "2023": 2}}
