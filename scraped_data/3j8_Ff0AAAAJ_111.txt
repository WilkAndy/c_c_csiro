The grapevinebased industry currently occupies 157, oooha (ABS zoo,) with grape production expanding markedly in the past o years (A BARE 2oo. 4). The wine industry is considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change because of its special dependence on unique terroirs that are strongly climate related (Seguin and de Cortazar zoo;). Increasing emissions of carbon dioxide and other grecnhouse gases are altering the composition of the atmosphere, leading to global climate change. Regardless of the actions that we take today, some degrcc of climate change is inevitable and there is evidence that some of this change is already with us.
