This chapter describes projected changes in temperature, rainfall, potential evaporation, drought, snow cover and regional sea level with a focus on mean changes, ranges of uncertainty and the possible time evolution of the changes under such a scenario. As well as providing maps of changes and describing their limits and uncertainties, more detailed projections are shown for a set of selected localities. Together, this chapter and the next \u2013 on projected changes to extreme events in Australia (Braganza et al., 2013) \u2013 form the scientific foundation and provide the regional climatic backdrop that is then considered, in terms of potential impacts on species, farming, cities and so on, in the remainder of this book."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8560972576181782286", "cites_id": ["8560972576181782286"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203370476-3/australia-climate-four-degree-world-penny-whetton-david-karoly-ian-watterson-leanne-webb-frank-drost-dewi-kirono-kathleen-mcinnes", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DgctNzOvznYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
