Cambridge University Press, Cambridge \u2026, 2006", "author": "Will Steffen and Geoff Love and Penny Whetton", "journal": "Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge", "pages": "219-225", "abstract": "This paper presents some Australian perspectives on the issue of what constitutes \u2018dangerous climate change\u2019. The approach is based on a sectoral analysis of (i) the degree of risk to climate change based on sensitivity to past or projected increases in temperature and changes in precipitation, and (ii) the limits of the sectors ability to adapt to climate change. The sectors/systems included in the analysis are human health, agriculture, water resources, coral reefs and biodiversity. A synthesis of the sectoral analyses gives some insights into important factors for defining dangerous climate change from an Australian perspective: the importance of frequency and intensity of extreme events; rates of change, in addition to the magnitude of change; the overriding importance of water availability; interactions of climate impacts with other aspects of global change, such as the direct effects of increasing atmospheric CO2; and the need to consider the resilience of the impacted system and the capacity to increase it. Some emerging issues, such as possible shifts in the behaviour of important modes of climate variability like ENSO and the stability and resilience of the Earth System as a whole under anthropogenic forcing, are briefly discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12258816196276948641,2194298951480079100", "cites_id": ["12258816196276948641", "2194298951480079100"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=777b3247b33299a061b898ed2fce00ea9f3c1db3#page=233", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oY7kaWEQIKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
