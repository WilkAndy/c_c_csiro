The MDB has warmed by around 1 degree since 1910 and will continue to warm (by 0.6\u20131.5\u00b0C in 2030 relative to 1995 and by 0.9\u20132.5\u00b0C in 2050 without mitigation), with more hot days and fewer cold days. The warmer climate and higher potential evapotranspiration will increase the demand for water in agriculture, urban centres, and by water-dependent ecosystems. Climate change will therefore increase the gap between water demand and water supply in regions that will become drier.The cool season across much of the MDB in the past several decades has been persistently drier than the long-term average. This decline in cool season rainfall has been, at least in part, attributed to changes in global circulation in a warmer world \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17502015788217359019", "cites_id": ["17502015788217359019"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128181522000127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q1r5NaGm4_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
