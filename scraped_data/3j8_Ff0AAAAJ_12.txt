Both countries are relatively wealthy, with export-led economies. Both have Westminster-style political systems and have a relatively recent history of non-indigenous settlement (Australia in the late 18th, New Zealand in the early 19th century). Both retain significant indigenous populations. Principal findings from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for the region were (Hennessy et al., 2007):\u2022 Consistent with global trends, Australia and New Zealand had experienced warming of 0.4 C to 0.7 C since 1950 with changed rainfall patterns and sea level rise of about 70 mm across the region; there had also been a greater frequency and intensity of droughts and heat waves, reduced seasonal snow cover, and glacial retreat.\u2022 Impacts from recent climate changes were evident in increasing stresses on water supply and agriculture, and changed natural ecosystems; some adaptation had occurred in these sectors but vulnerability to extreme events such as fire, tropical cyclones, droughts, hail, and floods remained high.\u2022 The climate of the 21st century would be warmer (virtually certain), with changes in extreme events including more intense and frequent heat waves, fire, floods, storm surges, and droughts but less frequent frost and snow (high confidence), reduced soil moisture in large parts of the Australian mainland and eastern New Zealand but more rain in western New Zealand (medium confidence).\u2022 Significant advances had occurred in understanding future impacts on water, ecosystems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 307, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1447815319422727469", "cites_id": ["1447815319422727469"], "pub_url": "https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/australasia", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LXWPtlysFxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 27, "2016": 40, "2017": 42, "2018": 49, "2019": 41, "2020": 32, "2021": 45, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
