The downscaling of global climate models can provide insight into regional patterns of rainfall change in the mid-latitudes in the typically wetter cool season. The comparison of statistical and dynamical downscaling model outputs reveals regions of consistent potential added value in the climate-change signal over the 21st century that are largely related to finer resolution. These differences include a stronger and more regionalised rainfall decrease on west coasts in response to a shift in westerly circulation and a different response further from the coast where other influences are important. These patterns have a plausible relationship with topography and regional drivers that are not resolved by coarse global models. However, the comparison of statistical and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2396966459221512706", "cites_id": ["2396966459221512706"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v62/n3/p251-265", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ApJshEu8QyEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
