Consequently, the reshaping and regeneration of Australia\u2019s cities requires transformative strategies for carbon mitigation and climate change adaptation that represent a clear break from current and past practices. Most mitigation solutions have a sectoral focus, requiring development of a range of policies and instruments to be directed at particular \u2018polluting\u2019industries and activities (eg electricity generation, transport, building) in relation to their respective levels of use of fossil fuel energy. Each of the sectors has powerful regimes that typically resist transformational change on the scale that needs to happen to enable a renewable energy transition. Australia\u2019s federal and state governments have clear leadership and coordinating roles to play, given the global\u2013national scale of the decarbonisation transition to be achieved in the energy sector. The role of metropolitan and local governments has more to do with, for example, promoting energy efficiency and uptake of distributed technologies for renewable energy generation among domestic, commercial and industrial sectors within their jurisdictions.Adaptation solutions, by comparison, are primarily place-based, given the spatial variability inherent in the dimensions of climate change as they impact differently on particular local areas and their populations. Adaptation planning and management requires governance structures that have transformative capacity for dealing with problems that are multi-level, multi-scale, multi-stakeholder and multi-disciplinary in nature.
