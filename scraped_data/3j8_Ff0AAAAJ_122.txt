To achieve this, the authors employed both technical expertise and regional stakeholder input. This document describes the study objectives and the process used to meet these objectives, and provides an overview of the CGBR region, the views of technical experts on potential climate change impacts, stakeholder prioritisation of impacts and adaptation options, a list of perceived knowledge gaps, and a recommended structure for a future integrated assessment in the region. The aim of the study was to determine the scope and focus for an integrated regional assessment of climate change impacts on, and adaptation options for, the CGBR region. The key objectives of the study were: Define and describe the study region; Develop a process for the study, which includes key stakeholders in the region; Prepare a comprehensive list of the regional stakeholders; Brief regional stakeholders about potential climate changes in the region; Gain insight from stakeholders into the climatic dependencies of key sectors and issues in the region (agriculture, fishing, forestry, tourism, natural ecosystems, infrastructure, pests, diseases and human health); Identify possible adaptation and/or amelioration strategies for each sector; Identify synergies with other sectors, and possible barriers to undertaking climate change adaptation strategies; Identify knowledge gaps, research priorities and current activities that may need alteration or enhancement; Define the scope of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15083470679809286453", "cites_id": ["15083470679809286453"], "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:38003361", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NWEN6qpAU9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
