But it is important to note the assumptions and caveats in this study, and the possible effects which it did not consider. These limitations mean that we cannot share the optimistic interpretations put on the findings by Reilly in News and Views3. Climate change cannot yet be dismissed as having only minor effects on future global food security.(1) Rosenzweig and Parry's data suggest that climate change will significantly increase the present unequal distribution of food supplies, thereby exacerbating the problem.(2) As Rosenzweig and Parry point out, the relatively benign overall result\" depends strongly on the full realization in the field of beneficial direct physiological C02 effects on crop growth and water use as currently measured in experimental settings\".
