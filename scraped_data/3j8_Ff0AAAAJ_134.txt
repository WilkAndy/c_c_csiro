The full range of projected global warming as given by IPCC (2001) was combined with projected regional changes obtained from nine climate models. The aim was to quantify ranges of uncertainty where possible. In this document we describe the steps involved in the method used:-Preparing ranges of projected global warming"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5802016072759036195", "cites_id": ["5802016072759036195"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5802016072759036195&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I8noteDmhFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
