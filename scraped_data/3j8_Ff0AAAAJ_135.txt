However, temperature trends over this period were influenced not only by external forcings such as greenhouse gases but also natural variations. The temperature of Southern Australia, the Sahel, South Asia and Southern Europe are currently within the warming estimates from statements in the early 1990s from the IPCC and CSIRO, assuming a linear trend between 1990 and 2030. However, northern Australia and central North America are currently at the lower limit or below these projections, having featured areas of multi-year regional cooling during global warming, sometimes called \u2018warming holes\u2019. Recent climate model simulations suggest that cooling can be expected in the recent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10832400396999998344", "cites_id": ["10832400396999998344"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1840-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iDv8v8RqVJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
