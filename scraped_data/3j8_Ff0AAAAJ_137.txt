Several studies of the impact of anthropogenic global warming on the Australian wheat crop have used probability density functions (PDFs) to quantify both the most likely outcome and possible extremes. For instance, Howden et al.(1999), Howden and Jones (2004) and Luo et al.(2005) all generated a distribution of changes in CO2 concentrations, rainfall (P), and temperature (T), based on changes simulated by coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean climate models. They then estimated the effect of these on crop growth using the APSIM wheat model (Keating et. al. 2003). Typically, a Monte Carlo sampling approach was used to combine the changes in individual variables. One limitation of this is that the changes in mean T and P are assumed to be independent of each other. In the companion study to this, Watterson (2011), hereafter referred to as W11, showed that this need not hold for greenhouse gas (GHG) forced climate change, using simulations by 23 climate models in the CMIP3 data set. Indeed, Tebaldi and Lobell (2008) did not assume independence of AT and AP (where A signifies change) in their assessment of impacts on global crop yields.One motivation for this paper is to demonstrate a simple application of a joint PDF for change, which includes an anticorrelation between the two variables, to a crop impact. This is aided by the use of an estimation of wheat yield impact for various values of AT and AP. This approximate approach is justified given that our intention is to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9824035006401017710", "cites_id": ["9824035006401017710"], "pub_url": "http://www.bom.gov.au/jshess/docs/2011/watterson2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bveI0cn7VYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
