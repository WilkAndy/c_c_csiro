Expected shifts in annual average temperature between present day and the year 2030 will be in the order 0.2 to 1.2 C in many of the Australian viticulture areas. By 2050 the projected increase in annual average temperature in viticultural areas is 0.4 to 3.0 C. The study included a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios, climate sensitivity levels and global and regional climate models.The projected changes in phenology for Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon in several representative Australian wine regions revealed a dual effect of climate change on the temperatures during grape maturation. In addition to the projected regional warming, the acceleration of vine phenology and earlier maturation, resulted in the ripening occuring in an earlier, warmer part of the annual climate cycle. Ripening may occur in the order of 15 days earlier by 2030, or 30 days earlier by 2050 depending on the region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16533719113622200006", "cites_id": ["16533719113622200006"], "pub_url": "https://chaireunesco-vinetculture.u-bourgogne.fr/colloques/actes_clima/Actes/Article_Pdf/Webb.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xp6JN--Rc-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
