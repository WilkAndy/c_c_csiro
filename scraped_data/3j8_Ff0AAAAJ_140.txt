Evidence is presented which strongly suggests that the marked seasonal variation in precipitation given for the latitude band 50\u2013 70\u00b0S in this climatology (with values much larger in summer than in winter) is unrealistic. Use of the Legates and Willmott climatology for purposes such as validating global climate model simulations is considered inadvisable for this zone. \u00a9 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6381073879698197231", "cites_id": ["6381073879698197231"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0088(199702)17:2%3C163::AID-JOC122%3E3.0.CO;2-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:70rvnOIgjlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 2}}
