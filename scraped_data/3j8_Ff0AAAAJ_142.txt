Australia\u2019s warming climate has resulted in significant changes in the frequency of temperature extremes, with a general increase in heatwaves and a reduction in the number of cold days. Here, we present the longest historical analysis of daily Australian temperature extremes and their societal impacts compiled to date. We use a newly consolidated early instrumental dataset and a range of historical sources for the South Australia region of Adelaide\u2014the nation\u2019s driest state, containing the most heatwave-affected city in Australia\u2014to investigate any changes in the characteristics of daily temperature extremes back to 1838. We identify multidecadal variability in heatwave and snow event frequency with a peak in the early twentieth century, with an overall decrease in cold extremes and an increase in heatwaves in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1687711105162176273", "cites_id": ["1687711105162176273"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-020-05298-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EWes6k70axcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
