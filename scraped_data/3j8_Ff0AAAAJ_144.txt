The range of warming is affected not only by the levels of greenhouse gases emitted in the future, but also because the rate of warming is not uniform across the globe. In this study, which examines the impact of climate change on the Australian wine industry, spatial variation in the warming rate is addressed. The sensitivity of the industry to different greenhouse gas-emission futures is also considered.Projected climate change will impact on grapevine phenology, and the variation in these impacts due to the effect of region, season, and variety has been quantified. Compression of the growing season, earlier budburst (in most cases), and earlier harvest in projected warmer climates is anticipated. Projections of changes to phenology are already being confirmed with the extremely early harvest this year (2006/2007 season)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4385476130721289024", "cites_id": ["4385476130721289024"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leanne-Webb-3/publication/51986567_Future_Climate_Change_Impacts_on_Australian_Viticulture/links/0a85e5302a50c52afb000000/Future-Climate-Change-Impacts-on-Australian-Viticulture.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QNOYPk5X3DwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
