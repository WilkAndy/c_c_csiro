Over the next half century or so, significant warming both globally and regionally is expected due to increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases.  Reductions in natural snow cover in the Victorian alpine area, as simulated here, could have implications for the ski industry, water resources and hydroelectric power, and for the natural alpine environment. A more thorough analysis of such impacts is beyond the scope of this study, and could be addressed through collaborative work with experts in these fields."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14992966220114234986", "cites_id": ["14992966220114234986"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14992966220114234986&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ag5XT1e3EdAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
