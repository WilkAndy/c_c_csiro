Two methods are used to provide the climate change scenarios. First, a range of arbitrary changes in temperature and precipitation are applied to the calibrated rainfall-runoff model to study the sensitivity of runoff and soil moisture to potential changes in the climate. Second, results from five global climate model (GCM) enhanced greenhouse experiments are analysed to provide regional climate change scenarios to estimate the range of plausible changes in runoff and soil moisture by the years 2030 and 2070. The sensitivity analyses indicate that changes in rainfall are always amplified in runoff with the amplification factor for runoff being higher in drier catchments. The change in rainfall has little effect on the soil moisture in wet catchments but in drier catchments, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 266, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11461757574340263368", "cites_id": ["11461757574340263368"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002216949402649V", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yL0xcMlXEJ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 5, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 11, "2001": 9, "2002": 12, "2003": 4, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 14, "2007": 10, "2008": 11, "2009": 14, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 19, "2013": 14, "2014": 12, "2015": 11, "2016": 14, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
