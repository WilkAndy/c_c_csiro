However, the changes were relative to an idealized base climate for 1980\u20131999, disregarding observed trends, such as those in rainfall in some Australian regions. Here we propose a method that represents projections for both forced change and decadal means as time series that extend from the observed series, illustrated using data for central Victoria. The main idea is to estimate the time-evolving underlying (or forced) past climate then convert this to a series of absolute values, by using the mean of the full observational record. We again use the pattern scaling assumption, and combine the CMIP3 sensitivities used for future change with a global warming series beginning at 1900.
