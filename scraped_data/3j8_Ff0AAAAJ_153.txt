Gas demand was significantly lower in 1999 and 2001 due to exceptionally warm winters. GasNet asked CSIRO to make an investigation of Melbourne temperature trends, and to project the underlying trend for 2003-2007 both in terms of average temperature and an index of demand called heating degree-days (HDD). We have estimated a range of trends that allow for warming due to enhancement of the greenhouse effect and increased urbanisation.Melbourne\u2019s mean temperature has increased from 1950 to 2000 by about 1.0oC. Maximum temperature has increased by 0.35oC and the minimum has increased by 1.6oC. Contributions to this warming include a regional (non-urban) warming trend, which may be related to enhanced greenhouse climate change, and a residual warming trend partly due to increasing urbanisation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=691750647600343201", "cites_id": ["691750647600343201"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5c7bcb6a2d0b59041e4941acdf87cc4cde4c4db3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oWhdh4yXmQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
