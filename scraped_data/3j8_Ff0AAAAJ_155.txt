To the north are tropical cyclones during the summer months and depressions developing in easterly troughs. Further south, low pressure systems such as cut-off lows, migratory lows and east coast lows are a major source of severe weather, particularly in the colder months. These systems are all capable of generating storm surges and severe wave conditions along the coast. Less severe weather conditions can also impact on the wave climatology of the region. For example, anticyclones can be a major source of wind-generated waves from the northeast, as can sea-breezes during the warmer months of the year.Beach and nearshore physical processes, such as flooding, erosion, sedimentation and littoral transport, are affected primarily by waves and storm surges acting in conjunction with normal tidal motions. Under conditions of climate change due to the enhanced greenhouse effect, the atmospheric conditions which drive ocean waves and storm surges may change in frequency and intensity and thereby alter the balance attained at the coastal boundary. In addition to this, rising sea levels will further increase the capacity for waves and storm surges to impact on the coastal zone."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5921206918388730007", "cites_id": ["5921206918388730007"], "pub_url": "http://danida.vnu.edu.vn/cpis/files/Papers_on_CC/CC/The%20Impact%20of%20Climate%20Change%20on%20Coastal%20New%20South%20Wales%20-%20mcinnes_1998a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l0glBFJaLFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
