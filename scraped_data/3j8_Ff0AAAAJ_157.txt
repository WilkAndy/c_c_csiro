These studies usually process RCM output to remove errors in the simulated climate. However, this paper investigates the suitability of raw output from simulations of a single RCM as input to a biophysical impact model. Our study analyses errors in wheat yields simulated for New South Wales (NSW), Australia by the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model forced with output from 2 RCM simulations with horizontal resolutions of approximately 50 and 10 km over NSW and with output from the global climate model (GCM) simulation that they downscale. Overall, across the NSW wheat belt, the~ 50 km simulation has a better simulation of mean yields for the 1990-2010 period than the GCM simulation, and the~ 10 km simulation has a better \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8500442115905170715", "cites_id": ["8500442115905170715"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v61/n3/p215-229/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gy1MMBGj93UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
