This concern emanates from the perceived mismatch of scale between coarse resolution GCMs (100s of km) and the scale of interest for regional impacts (an order or two orders of magnitude finer scale)(IPCC, 1994; Hostetler, 1994). For example, mechanistic models used to simulate the ecological effects of climate change usually operate at spatial resolutions varying from a single plant to a few hectares. Their results may be highly sensitive to fine-scale climate variations that may be embedded in coarse-scale climate variations, especially in regions of complex topography, coastlines, and in regions with highly heterogeneous land surface covers.There are now techniques available for generating high resolution climate information, but some tend to be complex and/or computationally expensive. It is also not always straightforward which techniques one should use, or whether high resolution information is even necessary for approaching certain types of impacts problems. The purpose of this guidance material is to provide researchers in climate impacts with the background material, and descriptions of procedures for evaluating, producing, and using high resolution climate scenarios. We also provide recommendations for when and how to use such scenarios.
