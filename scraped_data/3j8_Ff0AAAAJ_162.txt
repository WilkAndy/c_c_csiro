This update presents results of a project undertaken by CSIRO for SP AusNet on behalf of three gas distribution businesses (Multinet, Envestra and Sp AusNet) to assess the temperature, Heating Degree days (HDDs), and Effective Degree Days (EDDs) outlook for Melbourne and Victoria for the period from 2008 to 2012 taking account of the observed urbanisation effect and trends in central Melbourne temperature, and low, average and high greenhouse warming scenarios over this period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18009297860836287534", "cites_id": ["18009297860836287534"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/2007/suppiahr_xa.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LmRZsfzg7fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
