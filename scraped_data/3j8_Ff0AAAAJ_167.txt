Most of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the increase in greenhouse gases (IPCC 2007a). During the past century, Australian\u2019s mean temperature increased by 0.9 C mostly since 1950 (Figure 2), with an increase in heat waves, fewer frosts, more rain in the north-west, and less rain in the south and east (Nicholls 2006). There is a discernible human influence on Australian temperatures since 1950 and on rainfall decreases in southwestern Australia since the 1970s (Nicholls 2006)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18151539282485014648", "cites_id": ["18151539282485014648"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=e26808a770c6b6c032cc31be1abacd4b4116fc98", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eHARc8445_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
