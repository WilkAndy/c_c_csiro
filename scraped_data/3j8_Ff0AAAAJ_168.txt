The 11 year running average is indicated by the black line (Source: www. bom. gov. au/j-bin/sil/reg/cli_chg/timeseries. cgi), increase by i. 0 to 6.0 C over most of Australia with spatial variation across the continent similar to that for 2030 (CSIRO 2001). The impact of greenhouse gas induced climate change on wine rape production for the Australian wine industry was investigated ga spatial analyses of projected climate change across the wine regions of Australia (Webb 2006). The study used a range of emission scenarios and climate models of differing sensitivity to generate a range of potential impacts. This method allowed for uncertainty of climate change projections to be incorporated in the impacts modelling (Whetton et al. 2005) as well the specific future climates for particular wine regions to be assessed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17954266223992555717", "cites_id": ["17954266223992555717"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/7f3c7559590e7cc8daf04b0a81deef62/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=27822", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xcjeQwFeKvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
