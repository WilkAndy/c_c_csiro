Despite effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, further climate change is inevitable. In the Australian region, changes to climatic averages and extremes are likely to induce significant impacts on the Australian environment including water resources, agriculture, and biodiversity. Increasing temperature and temperature extremes, possible increases in extreme rainfall and flooding, increases in drought, changes to characteristics of tropical cyclones and other extreme wind events all have the potential to affect natural and managed systems. This presentation gives an overview of changes to Australia\u2019s climate that may be expected in the future. This paper also considers a range of recent enhanced greenhouse results for the Australian region obtained from global and regional climate models with a focus on their relevance to natural resources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16543008997063942559", "cites_id": ["16543008997063942559"], "pub_url": "https://data.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/static/publications/current-and-future-challenges-2003-workbook.pdf#page=13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n2EWwgiTlOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
