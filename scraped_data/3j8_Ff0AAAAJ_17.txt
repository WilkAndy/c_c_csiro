In the doubled CO2 simulation, the model simulates an increase in the frequency of high-rainfall events and a decrease in the frequency of low-rainfall events. This result applies over most of Australia, is statistically more significant than simulated changes in total rainfall, and is supported by theoretical considerations. We show that this result implies decreased return periods for heavy rainfall events. The further implication is that flooding could increase, although we discuss here the many difficulties associated with assessing in quantitative terms the significance of the modelling results for the real world.The second part of the paper assesses the implications of climate change for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 254, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12814164469552911463", "cites_id": ["12814164469552911463"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01098378", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZxQiVbEO1bEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 18, "1996": 19, "1997": 17, "1998": 8, "1999": 13, "2000": 15, "2001": 9, "2002": 10, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 15, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
