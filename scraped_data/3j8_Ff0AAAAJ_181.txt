The potential hydrological responses are estimated by comparing the model simulations driven by historical data and changed input data representing scenarios of climate change. The changed input data series are generated hypothetically as well as using two methods based on results of general circulation model simulations of the climate. The merits and limitations of the methods used here are highlighted and the climate change impact scenarios for Australia based on the current state of science are presented. The results indicate that climate change has the potential to bring about runoff modifications that may require a significant planning response."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4437620262703360571", "cites_id": ["4437620262703360571"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-5676-9_19", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O2qCDh6YlT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
