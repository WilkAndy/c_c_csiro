However, several studies have shown that downscaled precipitation is either insensitive to changes in climatic forcing, or inconsistent with the broad-scale changes indicated by the host GCM (s). This has been recently attributed to the omission of the effect that changes in atmospheric moisture content have on precipitation. We describe validation of a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM) for changed climate conditions and apply it to a network of 30 daily precipitation stations in southwestern Australia. NHMMs fitted to 1 x CO 2 LAM data were validated by assessing their performance in predicting 2 x CO 2 LAM precipitation.
