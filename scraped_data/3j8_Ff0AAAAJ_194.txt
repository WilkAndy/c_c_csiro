At 2016 emissions levels, the Panel\u2019s 2 C-consistent emissions budget for Victoria will be exhausted in 2032, and the 1.5 C-consistent budget will be exhausted in 2026\u2013well before 2050. The global 2 C emissions budget will be exhausted in 2034 at current emissions levels.As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the meaning of \u201cwell below\u201d 2 C has not been defined by the international community. The Panel\u2019s 2 C and 1.5 C-consistent emissions budgets for Victoria therefore provide indicative boundaries for Victoria\u2019s cumulative emissions. Victoria\u2019s emissions over the period 2017-2050 will need to remain well below the 2 C budget to be consistent with the Paris Agreement and avoid dangerous climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6320394880468224198", "cites_id": ["6320394880468224198"], "pub_url": "https://apo.org.au/node/240806", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xoiBKqiNtlcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
