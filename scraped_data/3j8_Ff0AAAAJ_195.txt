The most common way of doing this is to use the output from individual global climate model simulations driven by plausible scenarios of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. However, using up to 23 models would be a significant undertaking. Many of the scientists undertaking risk assessments have limited resources, so they prefer using a subset of models. Selecting the most suitable subset is a major challenge.To assist in communicating climate projections and to guide model selection, CSIRO has developed an approach called Climate Futures. It groups projections from the 23 models into a small set of broad categories with simple descriptions, eg warmer and wetter, hotter and drier. The novel feature in Climate Futures is the ability to assess the likelihood of combined changes in two climate variables. It is then easy to identify the full range of possibilities including the \u201eMost Likely\u201f,\u201eBest Case\u201f or \u201eWorst Case\u201f futures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2533617275239475078", "cites_id": ["2533617275239475078"], "pub_url": "https://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/Climatechange/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cawcr-report-internally-consistent-projections-v2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hidx93w3KSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
