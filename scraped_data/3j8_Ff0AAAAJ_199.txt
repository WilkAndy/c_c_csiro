By 2070 the projected increase in annual average temperature in viticultural areas is 0.8 to 5.2 C. The range of temperatures expressed here describes possible future projections dependent on population and varying global solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability.Temperature increases will impact on grape production and grape quality within a region. The relationship between price and other \u2018quality\u2019surrogates is presented. The relationship between \u2018quality\u2019and temperature is shown and the temperature sensitivity varies with variety. The relationship between yield and temperature is also shown. From the yield and price relationships, the income ($/ha) can be derived and also related to temperature. Climate change projections are used to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1587479229069443178", "cites_id": ["1587479229069443178"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/webblb_2005a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:asD-sPLbBxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
