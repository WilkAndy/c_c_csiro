The 1 \u00d7 CO2 results are discussed in relation to observed climate. Discussion of the 2 \u00d7 CO2 results focuses upon changes in convective and non-convective rainfall as simulated in the model, and the consequences these changes have for simulated daily rainfall intensity and the frequency of heavy rainfall events. In doing this analysis, we recognize the significant shortcomings of GCM simulations of precipitation processes. However, because of the potential significance of any changes in heavy rainfall events as a result of the enhanced greenhouse effect, we believe a first examination of relevant GCM rainfall results is warranted. Generally, the model results show a marked increase in rainfall originating from penetrative convection and, in the mid-latitudes, a decline in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 232, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6698050871406236556", "cites_id": ["6698050871406236556"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00209165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jBOqncdB9FwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 10, "1994": 9, "1995": 19, "1996": 16, "1997": 7, "1998": 10, "1999": 12, "2000": 9, "2001": 7, "2002": 14, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
