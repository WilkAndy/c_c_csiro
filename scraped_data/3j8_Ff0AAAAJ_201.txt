A secondary aim was to investigate whether there may be significant health impacts.Climate change may influence the levels of several outdoor air pollutants. Formation of photochemical smog is promoted in warmer conditions, although there are many other climatic factors, such as windspeed and cloud cover, that are at least as important as temperature but more difficult to anticipate. A change in the frequency or intensity of rainfall events may alter the rate at which pollutants are flushed from the atmosphere. Ozone and other photochemical oxidants are a health concern in several major Australian cities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17596100515503725592", "cites_id": ["17596100515503725592"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/hennessy_x2003a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GNyq0jDoMfQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
