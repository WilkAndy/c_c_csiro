A doubling of pre-industrial carbon dioxide levels during the second half of next century is almost certain. Such changes to the composition of the atmosphere are predicted to lead to global warming, resulting in climate change and sea level rise. Regional changes will affect a range of sectors making adaptation necessary. In recognition of this, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) has funded CSIRO Atmospheric Research to develop climate change scenarios for NSW to assist the Government and the community to plan for climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10413046113866211688", "cites_id": ["10413046113866211688"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jack-Katzfey/publication/253306907_Fine_Resolution_Climate_Change_Scenarios_for_New_South_Wales_Annual_Report/links/0c960538815d2ab7b2000000/Fine-Resolution-Climate-Change-Scenarios-for-New-South-Wales-Annual-Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aOHBFkWSgpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
