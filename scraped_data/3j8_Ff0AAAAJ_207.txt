The paper provides an Australian region example of how far it is possible to go at present in assessing possible regional climate change due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. The approach is based on critical examination of the regional output of global climate models, but information from other sources, such as palaeoclimatic studies and limited area modelling, are also taken into account. In this discussion we concentrate on regional rainfall change. Our assessment, at this stage, is that rainfall could increase in those regions of Australia where summer rainfall dominates, but that decreases may occur in the winter rainfall region. In addition there may be a general increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall events. However, because of the large uncertainty associated with this assessment, we are recommending that a range of scenarios are used in impact studies in Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11084203127087803504", "cites_id": ["11084203127087803504"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=gy8hgCGEkzEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA109&dq=info:cKxXeAQA05kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=PHEbRAMaSx&sig=EyhMwo4Ov2-yQdBF4MAIhbNHKhA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cKxXeAQA05kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1}}
