The analysis involves two different forcing scenarios and nine models, and it focuses on model agreement in the simulated regional changes for the summer and winter seasons. While to date very few conclusions have been presented on regional climatic changes, mostly limited to some broad latitudinal bands, our analysis shows that a number of consistent patterns of regional change across models and scenarios are now emerging. For temperature, in addition to maximum winter warming in northern high latitudes, warming much greater than the global average is found over Central Asia, Tibet and the Mediterranean region \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1106689361693728412", "cites_id": ["1106689361693728412"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2001GL013150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nF51aBzAWw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 9, "2004": 10, "2005": 20, "2006": 22, "2007": 13, "2008": 18, "2009": 10, "2010": 12, "2011": 12, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
