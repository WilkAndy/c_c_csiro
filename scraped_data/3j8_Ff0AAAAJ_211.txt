Here we apply the recently proposed\" Second-order Exchangeability Analysis for Multimodel Ensembles\" by Rougier et al. to study the effect of recent observed regional change as a constraint on future expected change. In this approach to combine multimodel ensembles, the climate model outputs in the ensemble are assumed to be exchangeable whereas the ensemble mean differs from the true climate system. Observations of the climate system are then used to estimate this\" ensemble discrepancy\" and the updated projections. We analyse the relationship between recent trends and future projections in near-surface temperature, rainfall and sea level pressure using simulations of the CMIP5 ensemble.
