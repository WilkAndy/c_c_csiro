The previously issued projections dating from 2007 have been widely used and cited in Australian adaptation work. Currently, new national projections based on global simulations from the CMIP5 multi-model archive and downscaled data are being prepared by CSIRO in collaboration with the Bureau of Meteorology. Along with the key messages about projected climate change in Australia, we present the main improvements over the 2007 projections and we discuss some of the challenges. We use a time series representation of climate change in sub-continental regions to illustrate the interplay of forced change and natural variability. Also, this representation allows us to put the projected change in context of the recent observed change.
