It may reveal regional detail in the projected climate change signal through higher resolution and accounting for local influences such as topography and coastlines. However, climate change adaptation research and planning desires a coherent view of possible future climate that accounts for the various sources of uncertainty and at a relevant spatial scale. This means there is value in combining the most useful insights from all available downscaling with a more comprehensive set of designed global climate model (GCM) projections (eg the CMIP5 archive), and this is done for the next set of national climate projections products in Australia. There are several practical considerations in this process that affect the process, primarily because \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFMGC41E..06G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
