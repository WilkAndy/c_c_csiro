These will be based on the results of global climate modelling, supplemented by other lines of evidence. In addition to a warming of one to four degrees Celsius by 2070 across the State, current science indicates more heatwaves, much reduced snow cover, higher fire danger and a likely decline in winter rainfall. Both increased drought and increases in extreme rainfall events are also likely. Changes to summer rainfall are much less clear, with projections ranging from substantial decrease through to substantial increase. Plans for updated climate change projections, designed to serve the needs of natural resource management planning, will also be described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/d5375bae7913da0972db2ab11dfe7ee5/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1256339", "cites_per_year": {}}
