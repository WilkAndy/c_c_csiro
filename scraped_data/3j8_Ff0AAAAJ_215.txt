Such projections are most typically based on the output of global climate models (GCMs) perhaps with the addition of a high resolution regional downscaling technique. There are number of issues currently complicating such assessment work. From the climate science perspective, there is the argument that individual model shortcomings make climate models an inadequate basis for projecting regional climate and that current model based projections may be biased relative to the range of potential climate change that should be considered in adaptation planning. In the study reported here, we adopt, as a strawperson, a set of climate change scenarios based on GCM output for a region in Australia and then test these in an expert elicitation workshop setting.
