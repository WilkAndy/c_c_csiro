The rationale is that a model should be able to reproduce key aspects of the present climate if it is to be used to provide guidance for future changes in climate. One may then select models considered to have an acceptable performance (eg Whetton et al 2005), or apply a variable weighting to the model results (Giorgi and Mearns 2002; Tebaldi et al 2005). However, there are a number of unresolved issues with this approach. In particular, the best way to assess the current climate of a model is not obvious. One can assess regional average or grid point model biases (eg Giorgi and Mearns 2002) for the variable and season for which projections are to be prepared. However, a model that performs well for a target variable, season and location, may perform poorly for another variable or season or at a neighbouring location. Regional climate processes in the model would be then suspect, despite the good performance on the targeted test. Other approaches place more emphasis on spatial patterns and combining the results from multiple variables (eg Whetton et al 2005). However emphasis on patterns raises the issue of how large a region one should assess a model pattern over. Should it be just the region for which climate projections are being prepared, a larger region, or even the globe? And what is the best set of variables to use?These issues could be addressed with an objective method for demonstrating the relevance of a given test of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5544676723bf9836b37307f8ad049fa8e1fb8740#page=121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xf0JyMRjMSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
