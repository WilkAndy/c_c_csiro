They can therefore only provide us with a brief snapshot of our climate\u2019s natural state and its variability. It is possible to extend these records further back in time, however, using evidence derived from non-historical sources\u2013that is from natural archives of past environmental conditions (called \u2018palaeo-records\u2019). Such records provide a unique opportunity to test and improve our understanding of natural climate change and variability in Australia.There are a large number of palaeo-records available for reconstructing climate in the Australian region, ranging from continuous records preserving annual to millennial scale change (such as those derived from tree rings, speleothems, corals, Antarctic ice cores, and lake and marine sediments) through to discontinuous records representing key periods in time (such as coastal deposits, palaeo-channels, glacial deposits and dunes). These records preserve indirect (also known as proxy) measurements of environmental conditions at the time they were formed. They provide a large body of evidence for past atmospheric, terrestrial and marine variability, which can in turn be used to limit the uncertainties in our understanding of climate change and its potential impact on Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/etheridgedm_x2005a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BQT788WYFeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
