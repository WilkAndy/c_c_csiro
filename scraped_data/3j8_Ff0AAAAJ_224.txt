Australia's average temperature has risen by about 0.8 C over the past century. There has been a commensurate increase in the frequency ofvery wann days and a decrease in the frequency of frosts and very cold days. Most of the increase occurred after 1950, and night-time temperatures have risen faster than daytime temperatures. While Australian rainfall has varied substantially over time and space, there has been no significant continental average trend since 1910. Rainfall has increased over the last 50 years over north-western Australia but decreased in the south-west of Western Australia and in much of southeastern Australia, especially in winter. Australian droughts have become hotter since 1973, with the 2003drought being the hottest in the past 100years.
