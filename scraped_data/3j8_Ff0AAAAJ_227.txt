They keep the Earth\u2019s surface warm. Without these gases, the average surface temperature would fall from today\u2019s global average of 15\u00baC to about minus 18\u00baC. Life as we know it would not exist. This trapping of heat by the atmosphere is a natural phenomenon, which has happened on Earth for millions of years.The difference today is that our activities are adding significant quantities of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Measurements in Australia and around the world clearly show a rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution (Houghton et al., 1996). During the last century, global average surface temperatures have increased by about half a degree Celsius, and sea level has risen by 10 to 25 cm largely due to thermal expansion of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14174786975571486923&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y6jFLaf1tsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
