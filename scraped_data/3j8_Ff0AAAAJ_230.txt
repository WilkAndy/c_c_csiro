The performance of these models in the Australian region has been assessed for the present climatic conditions and a preliminary analysis of greenhouse changes is presented. Spatial details on changes in key climatic variables and the statistical method for estimating rainfall events, is validated for a grid-cell in NSW and implications for extreme rainfall enhanced greenhouse conditions are also included. Other methods for determining possible changes in heavy rainfall events are reviewed. Conclusions derived from this study depend largely on the definition of extreme events and the statistical analysis used. Different definitions and statistical approaches could lead to different conclusions. An analysis of trends in extreme events over the whole of Australia using consistent methodology is planned.
