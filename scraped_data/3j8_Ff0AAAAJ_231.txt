The impact of a 3 degree centigrade warming on photochemical pollution is estimated for the Sydney suburb of Westmead. The few greenhouse studies which include Global Climate Model (GCM)-simulated changes in rainfall intensity indicate highly non-linear increases in run-off and flood damage costs. Implications for urban drainage, flood prevention and dam safety would require forward planning and involvement of local and regional agencies. Other possible effects on soil erosion, river sedimentation, aquifer recharge and salinity, and crop production should also be quantified. Results of a sample calculation of ozone production over Sydney with the Integrated Empirical Rate model showed that increased temperature would not further increase the ozone peak, although the time of day at which it was reached would be earlier. This example, however cannot be used to estimate quantitatively the effect of increased temperature on ozone production over Sydney. A further study is required to take into account spatial variations in temperature, NO{sub x}, and hydrocarbon concentration, and would need to examine a large number of cases so that changes in the frequency of high pollution events could be assessed.
