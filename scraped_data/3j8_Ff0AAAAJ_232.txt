The aim of this work is to examine the stability of the pattern of ENSO teleconnections over this longer period, noting any changes in ENSO behaviour which may be relevant in estimating its future behaviour, such as its response to climate change due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. Comparisons of the various data sets with each other and with El Nino chronology from South America, showed statistically significant evidence of teleconnections characteristic of ENSO back to around 1750."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-55f7c275-f92a-38ea-97b0-a6fa55a3fcbf", "cites_per_year": {}}
