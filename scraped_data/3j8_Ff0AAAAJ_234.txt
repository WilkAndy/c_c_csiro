To assess these impacts, scenarios of climate change on the regional scale are required. Outlined here are the current CSIRO scenarios of temperature and precipitation change by the year 2030, which are based on the latest relevant global climate model results. Due to much uncertainty in the science, these scenarios encompass a broad range of future climate changes. Implications of these changes for agriculture are briefly discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1993/concurrent/modelling/p1.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8ghs-FwdPjUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
