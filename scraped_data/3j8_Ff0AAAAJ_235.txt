In this paper we review in broad terms the present state of research throughout the world on the greenhouse effect, climate change, sea-level rise, and the impacts these changes may have on the environment, agriculture and society generally. We discuss in particular the results for tropical regions. General circulation modelling results to date indicate that the tropics are likely to warm by 2-4 C for an effective doubling of atmospheric CO2. The possible impact on the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, the monsoons, and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15291292246312428715&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qyQjAkiVNdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
