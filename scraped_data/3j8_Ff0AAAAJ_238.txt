In the previous study, the contribution of urbanisation represented by the urban heat island index (UHI) was calculated as the difference between observations at the Melbourne central weather station and the grid point data produced by the Bureau of Meteorology representing the Melbourne region in their gridded data set, which is based on rural stations that do not have urban influence. Details of this method can be found in the two previous reports (Suppiah et al., 2001; Suppiah and Whetton, 2007). Once the urbanisation component was calculated, remaining contributions to the trend in Melbourne central temperature are assumed to be due to natural variability and the anthropogenic effect. Temperature projections used in the previous report were based on simulations performed for the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2001 (IPCC, 2001)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.aer.gov.au/system/files/Attachment%2013.2%20CSIRO%20-%20Projected%20Changes%20in%20Temperature%202012%20to%202017.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YJUMd68XaZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
