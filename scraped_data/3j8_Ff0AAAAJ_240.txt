Under current climate, the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) is affected by large climate variability, high water-use as a proportion of total streamflow and competing demands for water. Climate change is expected to impact on runoff and streamflow, but large uncertainties have hampered planning of practical steps to manage these impacts. The possibility that already limited environmental flows and plans to recover some of these flows in the MDB may be threatened by climate change is investigated through three avenues:\u2022 Climate change projections for Australia, recently released by CSIRO, are re-investigated for the MDB.\u2022 Conclusions from recent impact modelling and risk assessment on flows and water use in the Macquarie"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11553661463624577088&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QHB2IuPZVqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
