We describe a modelling system built to analyse the risk of climate change using results obtained from water resource modelling of the Macquarie River catchment in NSW. Scenarios of climate change in 2030 and 2070, selected from the outputs of nine climate models, were used to perturb a long-term historical daily climate of rainfall (P) and potential evaporation (Ep). Relationships for \u03b4P and \u03b4Ep with water storage, Macquarie Marsh environmental flows and irrigation allocations were established and probability distribution functions (PDFs) constructed using Monte Carlo sampling. Critical thresholds for irrigation allocation and environmental flows were established. Decadal variability affecting rainfall was also investigated and found to vary baseline results by\u00b120% from the long-term mean. These critical thresholds are exceeded if streamflow reduces from the long-term mean by> 10% in a drought-dominated climate,> 20% in a normal climate and> 30% in a flood-dominated climate. Uncertainty analysis shows that global warming provides 25% of total uncertainty due to climate change, rainfall change contributes 64% and potential evaporation change contributes 12%. Understanding climate change in terms of local rainfall change will contribute significantly to narrowing uncertainty. However, Bayesian analysis shows that the risk of threshold exceedance is little changed after altering the input assumptions for rainfall or global warming that either expand uncertainty or alter its prior distribution.
