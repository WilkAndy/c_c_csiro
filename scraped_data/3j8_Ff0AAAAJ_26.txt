Any change in their distribution or extent due to climate change and/or extraction of water has the potential to adversely impact dependent biota. Satellite imagery was used to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of wetlands across arid Australia over an 11\u2010year period. Synoptic climate data were examined to identify the weather systems that caused wetland filling events. Simple threshold models relating rainfall to wetland filling for seven large regions of Australia were developed to examine patterns of wetland filling over the last 100 years. These data were used to examine the climatic processes that drive wetland filling and the likely impacts of climate change on wetland distribution. The strongest climatic influence on wetland filling in the arid zone was tropical weather systems. Their influence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 183, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=674582771501971297", "cites_id": ["674582771501971297"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1442-9993.2001.01122.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YTf54nSZXAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 11, "2006": 17, "2007": 15, "2008": 14, "2009": 10, "2010": 11, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
