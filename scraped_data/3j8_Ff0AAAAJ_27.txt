To begin, a regional interannual climate data set of high spatial resolution is prepared for input to the snow model and the resulting simulated interannual and spatial variations in snow-cover duration are assessed and compared with observations. The model provides a reasonable simulation of the sensitivities of snow-cover duration to changes in temperature and precipitation in the Australian Alps, although its performance is poorer at sites highly marginal for snow cover. (In a separate comparison, the model also performs well for sites in the European Alps.) The input climate data are then modified in line with scenarios of regional climate change based on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2506005893842575688", "cites_id": ["2506005893842575688"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00140356", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SKGFQxUfxyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 8, "2001": 9, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 1, "2005": 7, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 9, "2009": 10, "2010": 12, "2011": 11, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 13, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
