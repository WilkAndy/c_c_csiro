Records from 44 vineyard blocks, representing a range of varieties of Vitis vinifera L., were accessed. These comprise 33 short\u2010term datasets (average 17 years in length) and 11 long\u2010term datasets, ranging from 25 to 115 years in length (average 50 years). Time series of the day of the year grapes attain maturity were assessed. A trend to earlier maturity of winegrapes was observed in 43 of the 44 vineyard blocks. This trend was significant for six out of the 11 long\u2010term blocks for the complete time period for which records were available. For the period 1993\u20132009, 35 of the 44 vineyard blocks assessed displayed a statistically significant trend to earlier maturity. The average advance in the phenology was dependent on the time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 171, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13984173948417314695", "cites_id": ["13984173948417314695"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02434.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h4-vYB3EEcIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 12, "2013": 25, "2014": 17, "2015": 14, "2016": 19, "2017": 8, "2018": 17, "2019": 14, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 17, "2023": 3}}
