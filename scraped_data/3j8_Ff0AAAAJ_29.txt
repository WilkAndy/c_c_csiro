While it may be attractive to select a small number of climate models based on their ability to replicate current climate, there is no robust method for doing this. We outline and illustrate a method that addresses this challenge in a different way. The range of plausible future climates simulated by climate models is classified into a small set of Representative Climate Futures (RCFs) and the relative likelihood of these estimated. For each region, the RCFs are then used as a framework in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2047557868422705408", "cites_id": ["2047557868422705408"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-012-0471-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ADFkbAhjahwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 21, "2015": 22, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 17, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 17, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
