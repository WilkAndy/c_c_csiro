There are numerous methods by which this translation of information can occur. For users of downscaled information, it is important to have some understanding of the properties of different methods (in terms of their capabilities and limitations to convey the change signal, as simulated by the global model), as these dictate the type of applications that the downscaled information can be used for in impact, adaptation, and vulnerability research. This article provides an appraisal of downscaling in terms of its perceived purpose and value for informing on plausible impacts due to climate change and for underpinning regional risk assessments. The concepts climate realism and physical plausibility of change are introduced to qualify the broad scale properties associated with different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 149, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13967770923926367322", "cites_id": ["13967770923926367322"], "pub_url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.339", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WiypoKZ918EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 13, "2017": 16, "2018": 19, "2019": 18, "2020": 14, "2021": 26, "2022": 16, "2023": 20}}
