It presents results of a project undertaken by CSIRO for the South Australian Government to assess observed and projected climate change in South Australia using a new set of climate change simulations conducted for the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which will be published in 2007. It provides results for SA\u2019s eight Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions. This project does not update information about changes in extreme weather, nor does it update potential impacts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1156717272597887486", "cites_id": ["1156717272597887486"], "pub_url": "https://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/suppiahr_2006a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_nnBGjt8DRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 9, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 14, "2011": 14, "2012": 12, "2013": 17, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
