More detailed projections for individual states and other specific regions have also been prepared in recent years. Associated with this, CSIRO has developed climate change projection software, OzClim, which has seen wide application. The broad philosophy behind the construction of climate change projection information has not changed over the years. The purpose of this report is to review recent climate change projection work of CSIRO, particularly CSIRO (2001) and subsequent publications. A scenario or projection is a description of a plausible future climate constructed given certain assumptions about future changes to climate forcing (particularly patterns of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and stratospheric ozone depletion). Climate projections as produced by CSIRO allow for a range of different greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions scenarios and a range of different responses of the global climate system as given by a number of simulations from current global climate models (GCMs). A range of projections arise when multiple emission scenarios and/or models are considered.This report describes the approach used for preparing quantitative ranges of change of mean climatic conditions from a set of climate model simulations. The main focus is on projections of temperature and precipitation although, more recently, the method has been applied to other variables such as potential evaporation, moisture balance and surface wind. The method was developed mainly for changes to mean conditions.
