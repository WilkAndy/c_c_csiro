To evaluate this approach, we investigate the relationship between inter\u2010model similarity in patterns of current regional climate and inter\u2010model similarity in patterns of regional enhanced greenhouse response using data from a multi\u2010model database. Correlations of moderate magnitude are common, indicating the value of testing the current regional climate simulation of models. Notably, relationships vary significantly regionally (e.g., are weakest in the tropics), cross variables (e.g., current climate mean sea level pressure is related to temperature and precipitation change in some extra\u2010tropical regions) and can be insensitive to whether the current climate is assessed in the region concerned or globally. The concept demonstrated here can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4613487233784483494", "cites_id": ["4613487233784483494"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007GL030025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pg6GITJmBkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 10, "2010": 12, "2011": 12, "2012": 12, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
