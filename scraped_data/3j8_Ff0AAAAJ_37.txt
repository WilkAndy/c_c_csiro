Using proxy rainfall data-sets from Indonesia, Africa, North China; and a chronology of droughts from India, we investigate the occurrence of ENSO-related floods and droughts over the last five hundred years. The aim of this work is to examine the stability of the pattern of ENSO teleconnections over this longer period, noting any changes in ENSO behaviour which may be relevant in estimating its future behaviour, such as its response to climate change due to the enhanced greenhouse effect.Comparisons of the various data sets with each other and with El Ni\u00f1o chronology from South America, showed statistically significant evidence of teleconnections characteristic of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13459201701046019697", "cites_id": ["13459201701046019697"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01104135", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cWYuH6OwyLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
