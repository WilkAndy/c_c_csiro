Climate change, in turn, causes various environmental and ecological changes. Some of these changes (such as sea-level rise) will continue to respond to this century\u2019s warming for many centuries. Climate change differs from many other environmental health problems because of its gradual onset, widespread rather than localised effects, and the fact that the most important effects will probably be indirect.This document provides a risk assessment of various potential health impacts of climate change over the coming decades in Australia and, in specified instances, neighbouring populations of New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. There are large uncertainties in climate change health risk assessments. To address this, a range of climate change scenarios is used to represent a combination of the various intrinsic uncertainties around projections of future climate. Additional statistical uncertainties exist around the dose-response relationship between climate and each health impact, and the potential modifying effects of future adaptation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13440741003328305253", "cites_id": ["13440741003328305253"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/77769418/Human_health_and_climate_change_in_ocean20211230-9295-1jxki5a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZThp_boah7oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
