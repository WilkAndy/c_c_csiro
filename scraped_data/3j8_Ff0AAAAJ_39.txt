The increasing temperatures will lead to increased levels of coral bleaching, coral mortality and biodiversity depletion that could have serious consequences for the Reef\u2019s biodiversity, ecology, appearance and dependent recreational use and economic activity. Coral bleaching, some leading to death of corals, has been observed sporadically on the Great Barrier Reef since 1982, and most notably, widespread and seriously, in 1998 and 2002..We explored the implications for reef appearance and ecology of one pessimistic and one optimistic IPCC scenario for climate change at one inshore, one mid-shelf and one outershelf reef in the Townsville area. Based on plausible assumptions on the relationships between increasing heat stress and impacts, we produced scenarios for the reefs that suggested retrogression or at least a retarded rate of progression in the reefs. Interestingly, due to a lower sensitivity to temperature stress, the inshore reef fared best in our scenarios, perhaps because its corals are acclimatized to warmer waters than are those living on midand outer-shelf reefs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6362014625848502385", "cites_id": ["6362014625848502385"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39886026/Global_Climate_Change_and_Coral_Bleachin20151110-5952-kr3rgh.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cSiKRZhqSlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 14, "2010": 3, "2011": 10, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
