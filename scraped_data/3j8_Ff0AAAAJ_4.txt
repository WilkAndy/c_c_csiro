These techniques have been substantially improved since the IPCC WGI Second Assessment Report (IPCC, 1996)(hereafter SAR) and have become more widely applied. They fall into three categories: high and variable resolution Atmosphere General Circulation Models (AGCMs); regional (or nested limited area) climate models (RCMs); and empirical/statistical and statistical/dynamical methods. The techniques exhibit different strengths and weaknesses and their use depends on the needs of specific applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 823, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5957922373944912595", "cites_id": ["5957922373944912595"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5957922373944912595&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:06pWKtXKrlIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 18, "2003": 47, "2004": 47, "2005": 52, "2006": 60, "2007": 53, "2008": 49, "2009": 36, "2010": 45, "2011": 45, "2012": 47, "2013": 46, "2014": 41, "2015": 48, "2016": 35, "2017": 28, "2018": 29, "2019": 21, "2020": 17, "2021": 22, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
