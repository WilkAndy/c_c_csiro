These catchments are located in the highest parts of the Australian alpine region and the effects of snow melt-accumulation processes feature prominently in the hydrological regime of these rivers. Accordingly, a model is developed to compute equivalent rainfall from raw precipitation records, taking into consideration snow melt-accumulation processes in the different parts of these catchments. This model uses temperature and precipitation data as input, determined on a daily basis over the whole region under consideration (2085 km2) using a spatial interpolation procedure with a resolution of 2.5 km \u00d7 2.5 km. The snow melt-accumulation model is based on a modified degree-day method and provides the equivalent amount of melted-accumulated water for each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8159977601435098479", "cites_id": ["8159977601435098479"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169497000061", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b92uJGUQPnEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 8, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
