Warming was projected for all regions, with greater warming in Northern Hemisphere continental regions and less for Southern Hemisphere and coastal regions. Projections of annual precipitation varied, with the median result from the range of models indicating a wetter climate for higher latitude regions, such as New Zealand, Mosel Valley and North Oregon, and the Chinese region in this study, while Southern European, Australian and South African winegrowing regions had a projected drier climate. The median model result for winter precipitation indicated a projected decrease for sites in Chile, Greece, Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4922063603450648607", "cites_id": ["4922063603450648607"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajgw.12045", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HxiO5cSuTkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
