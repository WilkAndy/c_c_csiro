We consider the results of five experiments which use a simple mixed layer ocean formulation and five which use a fully dynamic ocean model (\u2018coupled experiments\u2019). For many regions of the northern hemisphere there is strong agreement amongst both mixed layer and coupled experiments on the sign of simulated rainfall change. However, in the southern hemisphere there are large, and apparently systematic, differences between the coupled and mixed layer experiments. In particular, whereas the mixed layer experiments agree on simulated rainfall increase in summer in the tropics and subtropics of the Australian sector, the coupled experiments agree (although more weakly) on rainfall decreases. These differences appear to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5652361614265352422", "cites_id": ["5652361614265352422"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00141702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5gBX0PA4cU4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 8, "1999": 9, "2000": 6, "2001": 10, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
