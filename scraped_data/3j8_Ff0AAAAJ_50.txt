After ventilation to the atmosphere, DMS is oxidised to form sulphate aerosols which in the unpolluted marine atmosphere are a major source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Because the microphysical properties of clouds relevant to climate change are sensitive to CCN density, it has been postulated that marine sulphur emissions may play a role in climate regulation. Here we examine the DMS cycle in the subantarctic Southern Ocean west of the atmospheric baseline station at Cape Grim, NW Tasmania, where a long time series of atmospheric data has been collected. The Southern Ocean is relatively free of anthropogenic sulphur emissions and thus sulphate aerosols will be mainly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8734260530999501575", "cites_id": ["8734260530999501575"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0889.1998.t01-3-00006.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B6PwRa1TNnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 8, "2003": 11, "2004": 10, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
