Successful calibrations of this dynamic lumped parameter model were performed for 5 rivers contributing streamflow to the Ovens Basin, and for 9 rivers of the Goulburn Basin. This is the first application of the model on such a scale, involving two basins where the total drainage area of the catchments modelled is about 6,500 km2. The models were tested by simulation over the entire common period of observation for the 14 catchments under consideration. The results show that the models closely simulate the observed streamflow.The effect of historical climate variability on streamflow was investigated. The models were used for estimation of the potential impact of climatic change on water availability for irrigation for different climate scenarios developed in the Division of Atmospheric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=299245342051384878", "cites_id": ["299245342051384878"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00139304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Lr6pmQ0iJwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 8, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
