Here, Australian wine industry regional scale climate and winegrape quality information were evaluated. A model that describes the climate sensitivity of quality measures for premium winegrape varieties grown in Australia is presented. The relationship between winegrape quality and climate varies for the different varieties examined: with some varieties, a linear reduction in quality in response to a warmer climate is exhibited, while a quadratic relationship of quality change with increasing temperature is exhibited by some other varieties. For varieties displaying a more linear relationship, the relative sensitivities to changes in growing season temperature can be calculated. For example, Cabernet Franc and Pinot Noir are the varieties \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4360617879590820756", "cites_id": ["4360617879590820756"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v36/n2/p89-98/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lFs6otsGhDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
