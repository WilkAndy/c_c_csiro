The consultancy addresses the following aspects of climate change:\u2022 changes in average climate (temperature, rainfall and other relevant variables) from the present until the year 2100 and beyond,\u2022 possible changes to ENSO, notably in its variability and amplitude, and related changes in drought and flood frequencies,\u2022 possible changes to tropical cyclone frequency, intensity and location,\u2022 potential changes in climatic variability, including daily, within-season, interannual and multi-decadal variability and extremes,\u2022 the development of methodologies to assess the risk of occurrence of critical climatic thresholds for relevant impacts and adaptation measures,\u2022 the identification of potential impacts of climate change across relevant sectors in Queensland, in collaboration with interested parties, and the facilitation of studies thereof, where appropriate through separately funded collaborative impact studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10234912286474346846,2232997906564220449", "cites_id": ["10234912286474346846", "2232997906564220449"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7511fcd83181ab66ea754496173ccccddbf0f62b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XqGVZn-2CY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
