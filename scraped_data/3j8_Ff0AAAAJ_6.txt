Thus, they are usually the main focus of attention of the news media in reports on climate. There are some indications from observations concerning how climatic extremes may have changed in the past. Climate models show how they could change in the future either due to natural climate fluctuations or under conditions of greenhouse gas-induced warming. These observed and modeled changes relate directly to the understanding of socioeconomic and ecological impacts related to extremes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 739, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5210534211022113884", "cites_id": ["5210534211022113884"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/81/3/1520-0477_2000_081_0413_aittie_2_3_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XEz-IUKJT0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 10, "2002": 13, "2003": 8, "2004": 15, "2005": 21, "2006": 29, "2007": 25, "2008": 28, "2009": 30, "2010": 32, "2011": 44, "2012": 50, "2013": 34, "2014": 46, "2015": 46, "2016": 55, "2017": 38, "2018": 40, "2019": 55, "2020": 34, "2021": 38, "2022": 22, "2023": 18}}
