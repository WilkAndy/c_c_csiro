Reliability is commonly assessed by comparing AOGCM output with observations. A desirable property of any AOGCM skill score is that resulting AOGCM\u2010performance rankings should show some consistency when derived using observations from different time periods. Notably, earlier work has demonstrated inconsistency between rankings obtained for 20\u2010year periods in the 20th century based on global and regional comparisons of simulated and observed near\u2010surface temperature anomalies. Here, we demonstrate that AOGCM\u2010performance rankings derived from actual temperatures, which incorporate AOGCM biases in climatological means, can be used to identify AOGCMs that perform consistently well or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4299294819248388253", "cites_id": ["4299294819248388253"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010GL043877", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nTj6BdwpqjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 6}}
