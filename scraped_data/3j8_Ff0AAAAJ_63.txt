These scenarios take into account a range of quantifiable uncertainties associated with projecting climate change and thus allow for a range of possible future climates for the region. Simulated impacts using a \u2018best case scenario\u2019are moderate: the area with simulated cover of more than 30 days declines by 18% by 2030 and 39% by 2070. Under a \u2018worst case scenario\u2019the reductions are very marked: 66% reduction by 2030, and 96% reduction by 2070. Comparisons are made with a similar study which used an earlier set of CSIRO climate change scenarios (Whetton et al., 1996). Reductions in the high case warming between the earlier and current CSIRO scenarios has led \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9187140559772684704", "cites_id": ["9187140559772684704"], "pub_url": "https://lib.icimod.org/record/10203/files/114.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oJHV3qlHf38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 0, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
