This vulnerability requires high levels of adaptive responses.  This study has identified a number of potential options for Australian agriculture to adapt to climate change. Many of these options are extensions or enhancements of existing activities that are aimed at managing the impacts of existing climate variability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8939955029942393004", "cites_id": ["8939955029942393004"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8939955029942393004&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rNiu27sZEXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 6, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
