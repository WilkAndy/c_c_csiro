Two data sets were used: a spatially detailed set for 1970\u20131980, and a less spatially detailed set for 1905\u20131980. The first five rotated principal component patterns (RPCPs) produced from the two data sets showed the same structure. These five RPCPs each dominated rainfall over a particular sub\u2010region of the study region, and the climatic regionalization that this suggested appeared to be one strongly determined by topography.The anomalies of Australian region mean monthly mean sea\u2010level (MSL) pressure associated with these five RPCPs of rainfall were determined using correlational techniques. Of the five main RPCPs of rainfall, the pattern based in the south\u2010west of the state showed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5683983138700307929", "cites_id": ["5683983138700307929"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.3370080204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2a2Ks4yQ4U4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 6, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
