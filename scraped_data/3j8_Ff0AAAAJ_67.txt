As these were designed communicate nation-and state-wide changes to a range of users, the projections focused on individual climate variables, such as temperature, with a range of uncertainty derived from multiple climate models. Over this time, CSIRO has also been involved in many impact assessments with collaborators and clients. These usually require projections tailored for specific applications. Such applications require internally consistent combinations of climate variables such as those based on output from individual models.However, many end-users of projections find the complexity (including the range of uncertainty) difficult to deal with. There are projections from up to 24 global climate models (GCMs), up to six emission scenarios, and around a dozen climate variables. Given limited resources, end-users often seek a narrower range of projections for their applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13473133609842863888", "cites_id": ["13473133609842863888"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Clarke-6/publication/257547805_Use_of_Representative_Climate_Futures_in_impact_and_adaptation_assessment/links/5d475dca92851cd046a25dd5/Use-of-Representative-Climate-Futures-in-impact-and-adaptation-assessment.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EG8PaqIv-roJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 5}}
