This paper applies a method of estimating distributions and \u201cprobability density functions\u201d (PDFs) for forced change, based on the pattern scaling technique and previously used for Australia, to generate changes in temperature and precipitation at locations over the globe, from simulations of 23 CMIP3 models. Changes for 2030 and 2100, under the A1B scenario for concentrations, for both seasonal and annual cases are presented. The PDFs for temperature have a standard deviation that averages 31% of the mean change, and they tend to be positively skewed. The standard deviation for precipitation averages 15% of the base climate mean, leading to five and 95 percentile estimates that are of opposite sign for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15287615285355626778", "cites_id": ["15287615285355626778"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010JD014502", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GkF00hqFKNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
