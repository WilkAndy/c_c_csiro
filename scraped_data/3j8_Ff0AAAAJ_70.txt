The drying is driven by well studied changes to the atmospheric circulation and is consistent across climate models, providing a strong basis from which adaptation planners can make decisions. However, the magnitude and seasonal expression of the drying is expected to vary across the region. Here we describe the spatial signature of the projected change from the new CMIP5 climate models and downscaling of those models, and review various lines of evidence about the seasonal expression. Winter rainfall is projected to decline across much of southern Australia with the exception of Tasmania, which is projected to experience little change or a rainfall increase in association with projected increases in the strength of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1610257921520540949", "cites_id": ["1610257921520540949"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mo/es15005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FZ39UAzJWBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
