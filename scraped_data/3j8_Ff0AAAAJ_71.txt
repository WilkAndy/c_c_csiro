A comprehensive assessment of climate model performance at the grid box scale in simulating recent change, however, is not available at present. Therefore, we compare observed changes in near-surface temperature, sea level pressure (SLP) and precipitation with simulations available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects 3 and 5 (CMIP3 and CMIP5). In both multi-model datasets we find coherent areas of inconsistency between observed and simulated local trends per degree global warming in both temperature and SLP in the majority of models. Localised projections should thus take into account the possibility of regional biases shared across models. In contrast, simulated changes in precipitation are not significantly different from observations due to low signal-to-noise ratio of local \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6817274328057558750", "cites_id": ["6817274328057558750"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-012-0691-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3rZCxOHSm14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 3}}
