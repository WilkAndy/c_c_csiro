This paper describes the development of such scenarios for the State of Victoria in Southeastern Australia using the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research Limited Area Model (DARLAM) at a horizontal resolution of 60 km nested in the slab ocean version of the CSIRO global climate model (GCM). Rainfall and temperature over Victoria are substantially better simulated in DARLAM than they are in the host GCM, although some poor features of the simulation of the seasonal cycle of rainfall have not been improved with the increase in resolution. There is evidence to suggest that some of these errors are due to errors in the simulation of atmospheric circulation provided by the host GCM. Under 2 x CO 2 conditions, DARLAM simulates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17514231396447942530", "cites_id": ["17514231396447942530"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v16/n3/p181-201/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gvdFI6kMD_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
