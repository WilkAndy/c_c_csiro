Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand", "pages": "170-176", "abstract": "Global climate models project temperature increases due to an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere (IPCC 2001). Past commentary on the impact of climate change on the Australian and European wine industries have been in the main qualitative (Boag et al. 1988; Dry 1988; Gladstones 1992; Kenny and Harrison 1992; Schultz 2000). Some European climate change impact studies have addressed spatial shifts of wine growing regions without addressing impact to grape quality (Kenny and Harrison 1992). An assessment was therefore conducted to determine the impact of projected greenhouse gas induced temperature change on the grape quality of a wine growing region and also spatial shifts of viticulture suitability.The wine industry is Australia\u2019s fastest growing rural industry with an annual gross value of more than $5 billion. This includes $2.7 billion in export earnings. The grapevine-based industries are rapidly expanding, high value activities currently occupying 111,000 ha. Vineyards have a life ranging from thirty to more than one hundred years so when selecting vineyard sites, or when managing existing vineyards, consideration of the changing climate is prudent."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2229993786578699395", "cites_id": ["2229993786578699395"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward-Barlow-2/publication/237556186_Impact_on_Australian_Viticulture_from_Greenhouse_Induced_Temperature_Change/links/00463529e5fa2d5699000000/Impact-on-Australian-Viticulture-from-Greenhouse-Induced-Temperature-Change.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gwRarIiH8h4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
