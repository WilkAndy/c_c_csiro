The results examined were the most recent available at the time of study from various research centers in North America and Europe, as well as those of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The approach used is, first, to assess the quality of the control ( 1 \u00d7 C0             2             ) simulations from each of the models of mean sea level (MSL) pressure and precipitation in the Australian region by comparing these with the corresponding observed patterns; and, second, to then analyze the 2 \u00d7 C0             2             results of only those model experiments with the best control simulations. Of the models examined two are chosen on the basis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17470485039290728445", "cites_id": ["17470485039290728445"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/7/3/1520-0442_1994_007_0441_aaopcc_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_T-zpJShc_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 7, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
