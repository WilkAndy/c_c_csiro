The Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO) asked CSIRO to prepare regional climate change scenarios for use in initial assessment of risks as recommended in the publication \u201cClimate Change Impacts and Risk Mangement: A Guide for Government and Business\u201d. Specifically, scenarios were needed for 2030 for changes in average annual temperature, rainfall, potential evaporation and sea-level, average daily extremes of temperature, rainfall, cyclone intensity and fire danger, average annual solar radiation and humidity, and extreme daily wind-speed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16200365806077491876", "cites_id": ["16200365806077491876"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16200365806077491876&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pDqiDt5C0-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 13, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
