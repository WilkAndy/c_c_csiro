Key landmarks with respect to climate projections for Australia were the Working Group 1 (WG1) contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4; Christensen et al. 2007) and the Climate Change in Australia technical report (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2007). Both were released in 2007, with the latter including conclusions from the IPCC AR4 but also building upon the large body of climate research undertaken for the Australian region. At the time, these reports represented a synthesis of the most up-to-date research regarding global and regional climate projections, much of which was based upon global climate model simulations performed as part of the third phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3; Meehl et al. 2007). Soon after the completion of CMIP3, the World Climate Research Programme embarked on CMIP5, which is to include an even more ambitious suite of climate model simulations from an even larger collection of modelling groups around the world (Taylor et al. 2012). Many of the climate projections presented in the WG1 contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the associated updated projections for Australia will be based upon CMIP5 data. These activities are scheduled for completion by late 2013 and mid-2014 respectively. Current research on the future climate of Australia, which is primarily based on analysis of relevant CMIP3 model simulations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14823139877141144383", "cites_id": ["14823139877141144383"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Damien-Irving/publication/269337295_Climate_projections_for_Australia_A_first_glance_at_CMIP5/links/54877e080cf268d28f0724b0/Climate-projections-for-Australia-A-first-glance-at-CMIP5.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P-PskC5fts0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 6}}
