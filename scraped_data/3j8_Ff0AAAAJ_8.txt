Various regional warming projections are based on a range of future greenhouse gas emission scenarios and patterns of climate change from a suite of climate models. Results are compared and contrasted regionally and the sensitivity of grapevine phenology to different climate futures is assessed. Impacts on budburst vary from region to region. Cabernet Sauvignon budburst in Coonawarra is projected to occur earlier by four to eight days in the year 2030, and by six to 11 days in 2050. Season duration (from budburst to harvest) is compressed in all regions studied and harvest is earlier in most cases. Given the highest warming scenario, harvest could be 45 days earlier in Coonawarra by 2050. Some regions may be adversely affected by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 455, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13183794526706090343", "cites_id": ["13183794526706090343"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2007.tb00247.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z0EOdEU_9rYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 22, "2011": 29, "2012": 17, "2013": 34, "2014": 32, "2015": 35, "2016": 48, "2017": 33, "2018": 31, "2019": 43, "2020": 41, "2021": 30, "2022": 29, "2023": 13}}
