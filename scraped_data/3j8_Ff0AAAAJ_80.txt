Changes in summer tropical rainfall in northern Australia remain highly uncertain.\u273d Intense rainfall events in most locations will become more extreme, driven by a warmer, wetter atmosphere. the combination of drying and increased evaporation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5201440020593401841", "cites_id": ["5201440020593401841"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BT/pdf/CSIRO_CC_Chapter%203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8V_46yM6L0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
