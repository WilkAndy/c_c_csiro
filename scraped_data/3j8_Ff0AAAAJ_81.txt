An assessment of future changes in the mean and/or variance of climatological parameters on regional scales due to anthropogenic ncreases in greenhouse gases is much warranted to evaluate the vulnerability of the region to such changes and to appropriately formulate adaptive response strategies. Some region-specific details on the climate change scenarios have been highlighted in IPCC Reports (1990, 1992 & 1996) and elsewhere in the literature (Whetton ct a1., 1994, among others). The performance of a few of the CCMs in simulating the observed climate over the Indian subcontinent has been examined and the future climate changes over the region have been projected (Lal et al., 1994; Chakraborty & Lal, 1994; Bhaskaran et al., 1995). However, these studies focused mainly on the result of experiments with a particular model under consideration. In order to gain a higher degree of confidence in the future climate change scenario due to enhanced greenhouse gases for the Indian subcontinent, a number of global climate models from different modelling groups of the world were considered in an intercomparison study (Lal et al., 1998), and their skills in reproducing the observed climatology over the Northern Hemisphere and the Indian subcontinent were evaluated in control experiments. Three key climate parameters, namely the mean sea level pressure, surface temperature and precipitation, were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1897559261707917508", "cites_id": ["1897559261707917508"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/whetton_x1998d.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xFhaRhh8VRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
