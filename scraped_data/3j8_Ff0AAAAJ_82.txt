However, increasing carbon stocks in agricultural soils is difficult and the ability of soils to store carbon as the climate changes is uncertain. This is due to many interacting factors, including those that vary spatially, contributing to organic matter inputs and decomposition rates. We used two models, the Sustainable Grazing Systems whole-farm system model (SGS) and the RothC soil carbon model, to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on SOC stocks in pastures in a temperate, winter-dominant rainfall region of south eastern Australia. A wide range of possible future climates were simulated from 2017 to 2090 at two sites, each with two soil types. Results demonstrate that projected rainfall, the factor with the most variability between climate scenarios, was the primary source of uncertainty in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10724156583688364488", "cites_id": ["10724156583688364488"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X18302488", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yGFpBpjb05QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
