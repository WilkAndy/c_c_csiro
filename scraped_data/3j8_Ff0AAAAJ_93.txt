These were prepared by CSIRO up to 2001, and by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology from 2007 onward. A range of scientific and communication issues were addressed in preparing each statement, including decisions concerning climate model ensembles, emission scenarios, forming ranges of change, use of probability, use of expert judgment, spatial resolution, presentation methods and representing uncertainties.There are a number of perennial issues, trends and tensions, which may be of interest to future production of regional projections for Australia and other regions. For example, managing and communicating uncertainty in future climate due to differing emissions and model responses has been a perennial element of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14026255411498721969", "cites_id": ["14026255411498721969"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405880715300303", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sSJIg_tEp8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
