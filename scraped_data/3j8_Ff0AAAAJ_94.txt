Since 1950, Australia has become warmer, with less rainfall in the south and east, and more rainfall in the north-west. Further global warming and climate change is expected due to projected increases in greenhouse gases. Australia is likely to become warmer and drier in the future. Small changes in average climate can have large effects on extreme weather events. Extremely hot years and days are likely to occur more often, with fewer frosts, more heavy rainfall in summer and autumn, less heavy rainfall in winter and spring in the south, more droughts, more fires, more intense tropical cyclones, less hail in the south and more hail along the east coast."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=331853615298669974", "cites_id": ["331853615298669974"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103078927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lm1O2Rr7mgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
