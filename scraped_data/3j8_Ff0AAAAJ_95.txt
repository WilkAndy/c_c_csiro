Cairns: Reef and Rainforest Research Centre Limited", "abstract": "The northern Queensland tropical rainforest region has more biodiversity than anywhere else in the country. Rainfall in this region has decreased over the past century, particularly after 1950. A new assessment of 23 global climate models from the IPCC data centre has now been made using statistical tests. We have compared simulated spatial patterns of mean sea level pressure, temperature and rainfall with observed patterns. On the basis of the results of statistical tests, 15 models were selected to construct temperature and rainfall projections for the northern Queensland region and sub regions. Temperature and rainfall projections are given for four seasons specifically related to the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility (MTSRF) region and also for decades from 2020 to 2080.Annual temperature is projected to increase between 0.5 and 1.4 C by 2030 and between 1.0 and 4.2 C by 2070. Rainfall changes are more uncertain due to strong model-to-model variations. By 2030, projected rainfall changes are between-6% and+ 5% and between-19% and+ 14% by 2070. Much less warming and narrower ranges in rainfall are projected in scenarios with stabilised CO2 concentrations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11684867222301202522", "cites_id": ["11684867222301202522"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/2007/suppiahr_a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WljeYNT8KKIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
