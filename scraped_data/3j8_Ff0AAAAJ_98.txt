However, an important question is whether the information derived from downscaled simulations is plausible. Some recent studies have attempted to answer this question using an \u2018added value\u2019 framework. This study takes an alternate approach by comparing projected changes of climate extremes from Regionally Dynamically Downscaled Model (RDM) ensembles to the host GCM ensemble over the Australian continent. Bias\u2010corrected sea\u2010surface temperatures (SSTs) from five Coupled Model Inter\u2010comparison Program Phase 3 (CMIP3) GCMs are used to force two different configurations of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Conformal Cubic Atmosphere Model (CCAM), run at 60\u2009km.
