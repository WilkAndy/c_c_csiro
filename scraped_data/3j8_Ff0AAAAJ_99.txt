Particular attention is given to those parts of Australia of significance to viticulture. Uncertainty in projections of future climate change is addressed and quantified where possible.Observed climate trends and future greenhouse gas emissions' The earth has warmed by an average of 0.6\u00b10.2 C since 1900. Australia's continental-average temperature has risen by about 0.7 C from 1910-2001. Most of this increase occurred after 1950. Minima have generally increased more than maxima. While there has been no significant continental-average trend in rainfall since"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "3j8_Ff0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1540098220967898355", "cites_id": ["1540098220967898355"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/ielapa.200302507", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:86wAFCyHXxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
