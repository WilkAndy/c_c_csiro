The inclusion of particle shape into DEM models is very important and allows many flow features, particularly in hoppers, to be more accurately reproduced than was possible when using only circular particles. Elongated particles are shown here to produce flow rates up to 30% lower than for circular particles and give flow patterns that are quite different. The yielding of the particle microstructure resembles more the tearing of a continuum solid, with large-scale quasi-stable voids being formed and large groups of particles moving together. The flow becomes increasingly concentrated in a relatively narrow funnel above the hopper opening. This encourages the hope that DEM may be able to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 814, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16711529458878919634", "cites_id": ["16711529458878919634"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X01000506", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0jP0WYBH6-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 7, "2004": 18, "2005": 20, "2006": 22, "2007": 15, "2008": 24, "2009": 32, "2010": 33, "2011": 45, "2012": 34, "2013": 46, "2014": 28, "2015": 51, "2016": 60, "2017": 58, "2018": 69, "2019": 56, "2020": 53, "2021": 67, "2022": 48, "2023": 26}}
