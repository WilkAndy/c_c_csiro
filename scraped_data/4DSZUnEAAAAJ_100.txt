This model could also shorten the development process of new foods because many virtual foods could be assessed, and discarded if unsuitable, before any physical prototyping is required. The construction and testing of a complete 3D model of mastication presents many challenges including an accurate representation of: the anatomical movements of the oral cavity (including the teeth, tongue, cheeks and palates), the breakdown behaviour of the food, the interactions between comminuted food and saliva as the bolus is formed, the release and transport of taste and aromas and how these physical and chemical processes are perceived by a person. These challenges are discussed in reference to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17511285860432360192", "cites_id": ["17511285860432360192"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/fo/c4fo00786g", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ADNkF7aVBPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
