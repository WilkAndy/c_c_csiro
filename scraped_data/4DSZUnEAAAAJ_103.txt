Discrete element modelling (DEM) has been used to analyse the pattern of specific energy applied to rock, in terms of spatial distribution within a pilot AG/SAG mill. We also analysed in some detail the nature of the forces, which may result in rock comminution. In order to examine the distribution of energy applied within the mill, the DEM models were compared with measured particle mass losses, in small scale AG and SAG mill experiments. The intensity of contact stresses was estimated using the Hertz theory of elastic contacts. The results indicate that in the case of the AG mill, the highest intensity stresses and strains are likely to occur deep within the charge, and close to the base. This effect is probably more pronounced for large AG mills. In the SAG mill case, the impacts of the steel balls \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12262473473073629280", "cites_id": ["12262473473073629280"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687506001580", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YEg0hqcOLaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
