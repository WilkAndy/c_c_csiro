A Design of Experiment (DOE) approach is used to define a series simulation conditions with the two factors being the lifter height and the fill level. The charge structure is characterised by the locations of the head, shoulder, bulk toe and impact toe. These are determined by visual analysis of the particle trajectories. The spatial variation of the liner pressure distribution can provide valuable information on the structure of the charge. This was found to vary systematically with lifter height and fill level. The relationships between the visual key locations and the key features of the pressure distributions were identified and found to be well described by linear equations.
