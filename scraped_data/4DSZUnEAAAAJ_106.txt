Although sampling chewed food during mastication allows local quantitative measurement of particle properties and taste and aroma compound concentrations, it is not possible to measure the full spatiotemporal variations of these quantities. Computational modeling can be used to estimate the values of these quantities throughout the volume of the oral cavity at any point in the chewing cycle or allow controlled parametric analysis that would be impractical in physical experimentation. We present a coupled biomechanical\u2010smoothed particle hydrodynamics model of human mastication and predict the mechanical behavior and breakdown of two agar model foods. The results of these simulations show that our model has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8235960101019841873", "cites_id": ["8235960101019841873"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jtxs.12062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UfWTbRMCTHIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
