The simulations are validated by comparing the results with physical modelling experiments that shows a relationship between the submergence criterion of the solids and the impeller speed. The experiments were conducted using water as the fluid and cylindrical blocks of wood with a specific gravity of 0.5 with near identical conditions being used for the simulations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9053887754300913369", "cites_id": ["9053887754300913369"], "pub_url": "https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/PCFD.2007.013001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2XZdZ_HepX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 8, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
