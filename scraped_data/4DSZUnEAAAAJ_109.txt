This consists of a traditional DEM model at the macroscale which includes only grinding media and potential coarser fractions of feed and product. Microscale models are embedded within this macroscale model. These can be sufficiently small that the fine powder can be included in a computationally affordable manner. The direct inclusion of the fine particles in the model allows predictions to be made of the effect of the local grinding environment on these fine particles. A shear cell is a good choice for the microscale model as it can well represent the local flow conditions at different points within the mill macroscale model. Averaging the macroscale flow allows the local collisional environments to be characterised and provides estimates of the shear rate and normal stress at each of the microscale \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16711994307766164829", "cites_id": ["16711994307766164829"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687515301047", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XZ3Aakfu7OcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 14, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
