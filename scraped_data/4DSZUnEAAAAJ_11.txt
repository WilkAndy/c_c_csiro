Increased understanding from the models can lead to improvements in equipment design and operation, potentially leading to large increases in equipment and process efficiency, throughput and/or product quality. Industrial applications are typically large and involve complex particulate behaviour in complex geometries. This paper explores the critical influence of particle shape on granular system behaviour and then discusses examples of DEM applied to several large industrial problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 240, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15374015422682092281", "cites_id": ["15374015422682092281"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674200109001308", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-dJXaJJ5W9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 20, "2015": 17, "2016": 22, "2017": 21, "2018": 18, "2019": 25, "2020": 33, "2021": 24, "2022": 19, "2023": 12}}
