Plastic strain and fracturing occur in food due to interactions with hard and soft tissues, whilst the food moves, collides and mixes with fluid. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless numerical method that uses particles instead of meshes to discretise material. The Lagrangian nature of SPH means that it is well suited to modelling complexities such as fluid-free surfaces or solid fracture, interactions with complicated deforming boundaries, and temperature and chemical dynamics. We propose a combined SPH\u2013biomechanical model of the oral cavity and present five model applications that address a broad range of material behaviours observed during eating. Interactions between the gums, teeth and the moving tongue with fluids in the anterior oral cavity; biting and chewing of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9026461024243706109", "cites_id": ["9026461024243706109"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00217-013-2077-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_Wj0MHpuRH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
