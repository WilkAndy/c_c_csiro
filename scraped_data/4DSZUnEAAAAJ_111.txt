It has recently been demonstrated that a rotating tumbler is a suitable device for separating out binary granular mixtures, i.e. mixtures composed of only two different particle types. However, most practical granular mixtures are composed of multi-component particle types. We therefore study the capability of this rotating tumbler to segregate mixtures composed of more than two components where the particles differ either in size or density. The general pattern of segregation involves the formation of an inner core of smallest or densest particles followed, at larger radii, by the next largest or densest particle type and so-on in an onion-like pattern. In the mixtures where particles differ in size we always get relatively pure inner cores of the smallest particles, while the other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15493032308127120308", "cites_id": ["15493032308127120308"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-013-0448-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tDuRc8xOAtcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
