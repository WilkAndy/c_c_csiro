Poor wear behaviour can lead to higher replacement costs and production loss during liner replacement. Prediction of wear behaviour using discrete element method (DEM) can provide valuable information about the impact of the design on the life cycle of the liner. Here, the DEM method is extended to predict the evolution of the shape of the liner throughout the life cycle. Using a Hicom 110 nutating mill as a case study, we demonstrate a process for constructing a wear model that is shown to be able to quantitatively predict the spatially varying wear rates over the surface of the liner. The functional dependence of wear rate on micro-mechanical flow quantities is not currently understood; hence, two model variants for each of the normal impact \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4408283428468281871", "cites_id": ["4408283428468281871"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.2721", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D9IXD2xeLT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
