We find that the more cubical particles segregate to the inner core of the particle bed while the spherical particles segregate to the curved walls of the tumbler. The main mechanism for this segregation is different energy dissipation rates for the different particle shape types when avalanching down along the free surface. The cubical particles, due to their sharper corners, dissipate energy much faster than the spherical particles. This results in spherical particles reaching the bottom end of the sloped, free surface which are then transported around the cylinder adjacent to the cylinder wall, as rigid body motion. In contrast to size or density segregation, the segregation due to shape is much \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5570681694533948694", "cites_id": ["5570681694533948694"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-017-0708-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FpV3h3wJT00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 8}}
