Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation has been used in this paper to study the behaviour of the media and the collisional environment in a full industrial scale Isamill. The DEM modelling has been able to provide a general understanding of the force balances that control the mill performance and the quantitative variation of key performance measures such as power draw and peak collision energy with changes in mill operating parameters and media properties. The key factor controlling the behaviour of the media and mill performance is the force balance on the media adjacent to the rotating discs of the impellor. Gravity and any applied axial pressure gradient play a critical role by providing a restoring force that presses the media bed against the discs which enables energy transfer from the discs to the adjacent media.
