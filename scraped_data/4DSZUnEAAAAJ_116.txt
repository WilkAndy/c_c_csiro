Stomach function depends on the timing and amplitude of wall contractions, the fill level and the type of gastric content. Using a coupled biomechanical-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (B-SPH) model, we investigate how gastric discharge is affected by the contraction behaviour of the stomach wall and the viscosity of the content. The results of the model provide new insights into how the content viscosity and the number of compression waves down the length of the stomach affect the mixing within and the discharge rate of the content exiting from the stomach to the duodenum. This investigation shows that the B-SPH model is capable of simulating complicated stomach behaviour. The rate of gastric emptying is found to increase with a smaller period in between contractile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5104528479736087892", "cites_id": ["5104528479736087892"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/fo/c7fo01226h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VMWIfJvt1kYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
