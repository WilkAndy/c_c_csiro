The SPH method is well established in other areas and is now used for HPDC. The SPH method (in 3D) and the methodology used to represent complex three-dimensional die shapes are described. The use of this SPH system to model the filling of a representative generic HPDC component is presented. The importance of the order of the die filling, first seen in two dimensions, is demonstrated as is the role of flow separation from corners and even moderately curved surfaces. The degree of surface fragmentation, droplet formation and the strongly transient nature of the voidage are also shown. Finally the filling of the runner, gate and die for a real automotive piston head from an automatic transmission is shown and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11952292998081973140", "cites_id": ["11952292998081973140"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471531702000433", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lIsQ4icT36UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
