Modelling of the coarser rock components and the grinding media is best done using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) while modelling of the slurry component is best done using a compatible particle method such as SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics). This combination of methods allows both these critical components and their interactions to be included in flow models for the mill and discharge arrangements. Information from such models can be used to both understand the flows in these typically closed and data poor environments and to help optimise designs for improved performance and superior wear life. In this paper, a typical discharge/trommel arrangement for an overflow ball mill is analysed using this modelling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13396217002126230992", "cites_id": ["13396217002126230992"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687517300262", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0EXIIWPs6LkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
