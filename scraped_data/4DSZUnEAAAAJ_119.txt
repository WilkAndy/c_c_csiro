We present a novel DEM implementation capable of realistically modelling such comminution processes. This extends on a previous implementation of DEM particle breakage that utilized spherical particles. Our new extension uses super-quadric particles, where daughter fragments with realistic size and shape distributions are packed inside a bounding parent super-quadric. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach in different particle breakage scenarios and examine the effect of the chosen minimum resolved particle size. This incorporation of the effect of particle shape in the breakage process allows for more realistic DEM simulations to be performed, that can provide additional \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8760724265448930773", "cites_id": ["8760724265448930773"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/10/1/012099/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1X06mU1YlHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
