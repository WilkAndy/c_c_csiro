The Lagrangian mesh-free nature of SPH makes is very well suited to these extreme deformation problems eliminating issues relating to poor element quality at high strains that limits finite element usage for these types of problems. It demonstrates excellent numerical stability at very high strains (of more than 200%). SPH can naturally track history dependent material properties such as the cumulative plastic strain and the degree of work hardening produced by its strain history. The high speed collisions modelled here demonstrate that the method can cope easily with collisions of multiple bodies and can also naturally resolve self-collisions of bodies undergoing high levels of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2536789119201677830", "cites_id": ["2536789119201677830"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X09001164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BpIXcEN8NCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 7}}
