During such an impact, the platform\u05f3s mooring system must maintain a safe platform attitude and withstand the forces from impact and the resulting platform motion. Here we apply Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to model rogue wave impact on a semi-submersible platform with a focus on the effect that different mooring systems have on platform motion and mooring tension. We show that mooring systems that are a hybrid of the Tension Leg Platform and Taut Spread Mooring systems could have advantages over non-hybrid systems. However, the mooring line material plays an important role in this assessment. In particular, the use of polyester rope in diagonal mooring lines offers advantages in the platform response.
