Dust pollution is a major environmental concern, and long exposure in occupational settings has been linked with numerous respiratory health issues. Industrial dust pollution can also present a significant explosion hazard, even in facilities with dust extraction systems. Computational models for dust generation and dispersal have, however, generally been formulated for specific geophysical applications and restricted to static, two\u2010dimensional, approaches. Here, we present a method for simulating dust production from a dynamic granular bed by using a three\u2010dimensional coupled discrete element method and Navier\u2013Stokes computational model. Dust production is based on an energy formulation in which micro\u2010scale dust particles are assumed to overcome cohesion to macro\u2010scale grains.
