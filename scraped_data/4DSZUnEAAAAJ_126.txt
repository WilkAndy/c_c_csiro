The charge shape and location are characterised by the shoulder, head, bulk and impact toe positions and are assessed by analysis of particle trajectories and the spatial variation of the pressure on the liner. Parametric models, created as a best fit to the DEM mill data, are used to relate these charge shape characteristics and the power draw to these operating parameters. They also allow inverse prediction of the fill level and lifter height (or wear state) from measurements of the charge structure and the mill speed. Such models can then be used to interpret experimental measurement data for SAG mills and to infer charge structure. The paper will also explore how such parametric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18421203843367114913", "cites_id": ["18421203843367114913"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687517302972", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oRj1uktDpf8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
