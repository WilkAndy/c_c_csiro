The inclusion of particle shape allows DEM models to replicate many features of real hopper flows that are not possible when using circular particles. Elongated particles can produce flow rates up to 30% lower than for circular particles and the flow patterns are quite different. The yielding of the particle microstructure resembles more the tearing of a continuum solid, with large scale quasi-stable voids being formed and large groups of particles moving together. The flow becomes increasingly concentrated in a relatively narrow funnel above the hopper opening. This is encouragement that DEM may be able to predict important problems such as bridging and rat-holing. Increasing the blockiness or angularity of the particles also increases resistance to flow and reduces flow rates by up to 28%, but does not have any perceptible effect on the nature of the flow."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13455108074771747648", "cites_id": ["13455108074771747648"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf99/papers/046CLEA.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QJNCe4EluroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
