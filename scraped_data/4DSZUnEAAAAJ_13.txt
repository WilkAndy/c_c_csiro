The models are quite consistent for high normal coefficients of restitution but significant differences are noted between the models as the normal coefficient of restitution reduces. The reasons for the differences, in terms of the rebound tangential surface velocities, are explained for both plastic and viscous dissipation models. A new \u2018partially latching spring\u2019 model is proposed that provides realistic predictions of the contact force magnitude and contact duration. Finally, a general condition for sliding to occur throughout inelastic impacts is identified for any value of the normal coefficient of restitution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 225, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12345656831874704954", "cites_id": ["12345656831874704954"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591012005670", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OibEfnqVVKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 14, "2014": 10, "2015": 27, "2016": 9, "2017": 18, "2018": 31, "2019": 21, "2020": 21, "2021": 36, "2022": 18, "2023": 18}}
