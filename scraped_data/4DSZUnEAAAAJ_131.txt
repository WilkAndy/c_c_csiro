Traditionally, scaled down physical models have been used for validation and to collect hydraulic data. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models however provide advantages in time, cost and resource reduction. CFD models also provide greater efficiency when evaluating a range of spillway designs or operating conditions. Within the present literature, most studies of computational spillway models utilise a mesh-based method. In this work we use the particle based method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model weir flow through a four bay, gated, spillway system. Advantages of SPH for such modelling include automatic representation of the free surface flow behaviour due to the Lagrangian nature of the method, and the ability to incorporate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4556750681923174917", "cites_id": ["4556750681923174917"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X14002704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BcIMPprUPD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
