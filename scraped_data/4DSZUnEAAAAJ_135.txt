Often the temperature of the granular material needs to be manipulated for example in the case of heating iron ore to induce a phase change or to be kept within a certain temperature range in the case of pharmaceutical powders and food products. Thus a detailed understanding of how heat is transferred in granular materials is essential. The most feasible numerical approach to study heat transfer in granular materials is using the discrete element method (DEM), where each particle is explicitly modeled. In terms of conductive heat transfer particle shape can be expected to have a significant effect on the heating of granular materials, due to the nature of the grain to grain contacts and packing topology which control the heat flow paths and the rate that heat is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17009136193722701084", "cites_id": ["17009136193722701084"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250920301160", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HNUU-z-XDOwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
