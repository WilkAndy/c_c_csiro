A fully coupled three-dimensional elastoplastic and heat transfer analysis is used to study the flow pattern of the filler material, and the resulting plastic strain development and temperature distributions for a simple arc welding configuration. The mesh-less and Lagrangian nature of SPH enables modelling of problems with large deformation and discontinuities, avoiding several disadvantages of the traditional mesh-based methods (e.g., FEM, FDM and FVM), and it is also able to implement coupled physics and complex constitutive behaviours due to the history tracking ability of the method.The plastic deformation and temperature distribution of the metal in the weld pool and the surrounding parent material are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1182866302364435241", "cites_id": ["1182866302364435241"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750316300266", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KUM2iaJiahAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
