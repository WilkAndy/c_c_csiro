Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) swimming modelling provides a controlled and unobtrusive capability that provides many previously immeasurable quantities including full flow fields and information on the forces experienced by the body throughout the stroke. In this study, a coupled biomechanical-smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used to determine when peak arm thrust occurs and how the ratio of arm\u2013leg thrust changes with stroke rate. A dynamic biomechanical model of a female national-level swimmer was generated from a three-dimensional laser body scan of the athlete and multi-angle videos of sub-maximal swimming trials. This was coupled to the SPH method to simulate the fluid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4887952388606472541", "cites_id": ["4887952388606472541"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12283-017-0246-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XTHpycx-1UMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
