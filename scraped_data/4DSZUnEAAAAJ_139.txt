SPH has natural advantages for simulating problems involving compression of deformable solids arising from its ability to handle large deformation without re-meshing, complex free surface behaviour and tracking of multiple material interfaces. The \u2018classical SPH method\u2019, as originally proposed by Monaghan (in Ann Rev Astron 30:543\u2013574, 1992, Rep Prog Phys 68:1703\u20131759, 2005), has become broadly established as a robust method in different areas, especially involving fluid flows. However, limited attention has been paid to understanding of its numerical performance for elastic deformation problems. To address this, we evaluate the classical SPH method to explore its stability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=478007467618241369", "cites_id": ["478007467618241369"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-014-9948-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WYteW0I5ogYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
