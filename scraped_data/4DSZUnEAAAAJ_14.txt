Challenges remain in developing models that balance the depth of the physics with the computational expense that is affordable and in the development of measurement and characterization processes to provide this expanding array of input data required. Steadily increasing computer power has seen model sizes grow from thousands of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5642692866383863425", "cites_id": ["5642692866383863425"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02644400910975487/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gd5wBUTfTk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 20, "2012": 9, "2013": 16, "2014": 9, "2015": 30, "2016": 20, "2017": 20, "2018": 17, "2019": 20, "2020": 20, "2021": 11, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
