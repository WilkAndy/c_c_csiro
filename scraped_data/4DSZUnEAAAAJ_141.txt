The free surface modelling capability of SPH and 3D visualisation of the fluid flow leads to a better understanding of the flow characteristics during the furnace tipping phase of the operation. Experimental mass flow rate measurements are used to validate the SPH simulation predictions. The relative amount of oxide generated during the furnace tipping phase and the phase of metal discharge from the ingot wheel are then predicted. Results indicate that the furnace tipping process can lead to as much as two thirds of the total oxide generated during melt transfer from the furnace to the ingot. This suggests that optimisation of furnace design and the tipping process could lead to significant improvements in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1439428352910797108", "cites_id": ["1439428352910797108"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013608006092", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NKnf5nXg-RMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
