Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a non-conventional computational fluid dynamics method that has been successfully applied to these problems. Due to its mesh-free nature, it can handle complex splashing free surface flows and the differential motion of multiple solid-casting equipment components relatively easily. The ability of SPH to predict the detailed filling patterns of real large-scale automotive die castings is demonstrated in this study, and the use of SPH simulation for wheel shape optimization in ingot casting based on minimizing oxide generation while increasing the throughput is also presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8046173364524799109", "cites_id": ["8046173364524799109"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-004-0038-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hdS1aQvAqW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
