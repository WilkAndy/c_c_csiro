Several failure scenarios are used for predicting consequences in terms of downstream inundation and damage. The fluid flow component is performed using the mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. For a representative earthen dam, piping and landslip are identified as key failure modes based on a combination of finite element analysis, theory and physical observations. Inundation behaviour is very different for the two failure modes. The landslip failure is the most critical one for the dam studied with flood water breaking the river bank and affecting surrounding property and farmland. For the piping failures, water flow from the initial pipes formed for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15048999793646912097", "cites_id": ["15048999793646912097"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-014-1379-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YUJATZTJ2NAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
