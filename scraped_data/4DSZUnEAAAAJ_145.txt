In this paper we focus on the application of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the transport of granular material by screw feeders. Examples of 3D models of enclosed screw feeders are presented along with detailed predictions of their performance, namely: (1) the effect on the mass flow rate of a screw feeder as its angle of inclination was increased; (2) the effect on the mass flow rate of a screw feeder having a shaft-less screw as its inclination increased; (3) the degree to which particles of different sizes segregate as they are pushed along the screw feeder; and (4) the nature of the draw down of the bulk material from a hopper into the screw casing by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16978802945027471068,10436692078974023913", "cites_id": ["16978802945027471068", "10436692078974023913"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.914842603983463", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Pa3KVLToOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
