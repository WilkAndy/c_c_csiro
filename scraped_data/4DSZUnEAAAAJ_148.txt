DEM is able to predict wear and profile evolution of liners over the life cycle for specific sets of conditions. However, real operation conditions often vary \u2013 usually in ways that are not known in advance, which limits the ability to use such model predictions in managing associated wear. In this study, we use a specific case of a tumbling mill to explore issues around the variability of wear caused by different operating conditions within the applicable range for the mill, and consider how these can be included in a modelling framework in order to assist with mill liner management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7519197897947493853", "cites_id": ["7519197897947493853"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687514003756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3TUGV6aOWWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
