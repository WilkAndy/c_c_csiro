Laser body scans of national-level athletes and synchronized multiangle swimming footage were used in a novel markerless motion capture process to produce three-dimensional biomechanical models of the swimming athletes. The deforming surface meshes were then used to calculate swimmer center-of-mass (CoM) positions, center-of-buoyancy (CoB) positions, pitch buoyancy torques, and sagittal plane moments of inertia (MoI) throughout each stroke cycle. In all cases the mean buoyancy torque tended to raise the legs and lower the head; however, during part of the butterfly stroke the instantaneous buoyancy torque had the opposite effect. The swimming strokes that use opposing arm and leg strokes (freestyle and backstroke) had smaller \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16598379341372061215", "cites_id": ["16598379341372061215"], "pub_url": "https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jab/30/5/article-p609.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H_apqRFKWeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
