This paper concentrates on the use of SPH to simulate a broad range of complex industrial fluid flow problems. These include free surface fluid flow for the generation of digital content, geophysical flows such as volcanic lava flows and tsunamis, several types of die casting (gravity, high pressure and ingot casting), resin transfer moulding and flow in porous media, mixing of particulates in liquid, pyrometallurgy and slurry flow in semi-autogenous grinding mills. The strengths and weaknesses of SPH will be explored and future opportunities for using the method to make major modelling advances are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 212, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16976093923738980643", "cites_id": ["16976093923738980643"], "pub_url": "https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/PCFD.2007.013000", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IxEh_nozl-sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 8, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 8, "2010": 15, "2011": 16, "2012": 21, "2013": 10, "2014": 16, "2015": 22, "2016": 9, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
