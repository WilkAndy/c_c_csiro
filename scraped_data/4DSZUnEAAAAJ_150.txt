The mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique is ideally suited to overcome many of these difficulties. Initial simulations of towing using SPH for both male and female swimmers in a fixed glide pose at different speeds are presented. The surface shapes of the swimmers\u2019 bodies were generated from laser scans of athletes. The motion of a male swimmer in submerged dolphin-kick swimming is also explored. The stroke kinematics was generated using skeletal based deformation of the surface mesh to closely mimic underwater video footage of an elite swimmer. The two cases investigated are of slow kicking at 0.8 Hz with a prescribed speed of 1.0 m/s and of fast kicking at 2.0 Hz with a speed of 1.5 m/s. They demonstrate the capability of SPH to handle the modelling complexities that human swimming represents."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8640417249747316685", "cites_id": ["8640417249747316685"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond-Cohen/publication/274856749_Simulations_of_human_swimming_using_Smoothed_Particle_Hydrodynamics/links/552b66940cf29b22c9c1a924/Simulations-of-human-swimming-using-Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:za9YsrXt6HcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
