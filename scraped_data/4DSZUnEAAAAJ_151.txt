Food, mineral processing, and pharmaceuticals industries all utilize vibratory processes for the handling and transport of granular materials. Understanding how a granular material responds when subjected to vibration is essential for equipment design. Three-dimensional discrete element simulations have been used in this study to investigate the convective motion leading to arching in a vertically vibrated, deep granular bed. The undulating granular layer contains alternating regions that first compact and then relax. The dynamics of these regions may depend on material properties such as restitution and friction coefficients; as well as particle shape. The effects of these factors on the kinematics and dynamics of the arching pattern are investigated here \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11563396841053303224", "cites_id": ["11563396841053303224"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-009-0147-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uDHbUylweaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
