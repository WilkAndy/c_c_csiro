Complete experimental measures of stroke technique and the interactions between the water and the paddle and the boat are not practical in a racing environment. Instead, simulation using computational fluid dynamics can be used to study this system. A coupled biomechanical-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (B-SPH) model of the kayaking athlete is presented. Verification and validation of the model are confirmed using drag force data from the literature and a spatial resolution study. Using this model and stroke kinematics (developed from the combination of literature data and digitised motion of an amateur level athlete from video), calculations are made of (a) the fluid response to interactions with the paddle and kayak; (b) speed of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13490524519320481025", "cites_id": ["13490524519320481025"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167945718306353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AW3LD5P4N7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
