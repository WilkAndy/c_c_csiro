Here we use measured data from a well characterised ore in a well instrumented, 1.2\u202fm diameter pilot scale mill to validate direct DEM prediction of particle size reduction. The key comminution mechanisms involved for a SAG mill are: (1) incremental breakage where parent particles break into progeny based on the cumulative energy absorption above the elastic damage threshold, (2) abrasion, and (3) chipping/rounding due to preferential contact and breakage of corners and edges of non-round particles. In this paper, a method for including incremental damage breakage in DEM is presented. The inclusion of all the size reduction mechanisms in the same DEM framework allows direct prediction of the evolution of the resident rock particle size and shape distributions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=884222629266453235", "cites_id": ["884222629266453235"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687518303637", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8_LJ58tjRQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
