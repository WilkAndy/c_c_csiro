Experimental measures of forces on the body are impractical so instead computational simulation is used to estimate this loading. A coupled Biomechanical-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (B-SPH) model for diver and water is developed and applied to a reverse pike dive performed by an elite athlete. The body surface is represented by a mesh that deforms in response to measured skeleton kinematics acquired from multi-camera video. Calculations of the fluid forces on the body and the transmission of torque through the upper body joints are made. Loading on the body segments and joints is found to be closely related to the dynamic behaviour of the body and water.
