A better understanding of cortical bone remodelling mechanisms can help discern changes at this anatomical site, which are essential if an understanding of the mechanisms by which hips weaken and become vulnerable to fracture is to be gained. The aims of this study were to (i) examine a hypothesis that low strain fields arise because of subject\u2010specific Haversian canal distributions causing bone resorption and reduced bone integrity and (ii) introduce the use of a meshless particle\u2010based computational modelling approach SPH to capture bone remodelling features at the level of the Haversian canals. We show that bone remodelling initiated by strain at the Haversian level is highly influenced by the subject\u2010specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4591384877567782330", "cites_id": ["4591384877567782330"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cnm.2503", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ui2HTjjgtz8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
