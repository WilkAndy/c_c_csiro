We explore fully-3D wave impact behaviour on a semi-submersible platform using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Wave impact and propagation around and through the structure is complex and induces non-trivial motion. Large waves can impact the underside of the production deck or the upper superstructure. Such impacts can induce dangerous motions, threaten the structural integrity of the platform and create significant risk to people and equipment. These issues are investigated for different mooring configurations and a range of wave heights."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8998723711040721737", "cites_id": ["8998723711040721737"], "pub_url": "https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/PCFD.2009.027364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SZN3tInj4XwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
