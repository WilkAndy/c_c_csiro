The SMD has a vertically orientated octagonal shell which supports a vertical shaft that has protruding impeller arms to agitate the charge. There is very little understanding of the motion and physical structure of the charge during operation in these devices. This paper explores the flow and interaction of media and slurry in a commercially available SMD 1100E, which has a motor with a power rating of 1100\u202fkW. A transient two-way coupled Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model is used to achieve this. The DEM component represents the ceramic grinding media which is fully resolved while the SPH model represents the slurry (water and fine feed and/or product). The centrifugal force generated by the rotational action of the impeller arms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5320267626666644568", "cites_id": ["5320267626666644568"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089268751930113X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WNR57Tdj1UkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
