Understanding the granular motion within these beds is essential for design, optimisation and control of such processes. Motion on the particle scale is difficult to measure experimentally, making computational simulations invaluable for determining the dynamics within such systems. Computational models which have had the greatest success at capturing the full range of dynamics are coupled discrete element model and Navier\u2013Stokes solvers, based on a pressure-gradient-force formulation. However, most discrete element models assume spherical geometry for the particles. Particle shape in many important industrial processes, such as catalysis and pyrolysis, is often non-spherical. We present a re-formulation of the pressure-gradient force model, based on a modified pressure correction method, coupled to a discrete \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13650086400145190038", "cites_id": ["13650086400145190038"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000925090900743X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lmwLekLZbr0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 11, "2014": 9, "2015": 19, "2016": 17, "2017": 19, "2018": 22, "2019": 19, "2020": 20, "2021": 17, "2022": 16, "2023": 12}}
