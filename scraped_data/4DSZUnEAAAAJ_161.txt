Since they involve complex multiphase heat and mass transfer processes, optimization would ideally be guided by numerical modelling. A new generic hierarchical approach is proposed in this paper, sequentially combining 2D Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of slices of the bed and 3D two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the entire kiln, encompassing both bed and gaseous freeboard. DEM simulations have been used to derive mean solids velocities in a bed for various rotation speeds and particle sizes, and these were then used to calibrate and validate the solids rheology model used in the subsequent CFD model. A modified Coulombic friction for the bed in the CFD model was shown to give satisfactory agreement with the DEM bed results over a range \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15139671246821514646", "cites_id": ["15139671246821514646"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687518300463", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lt39GsnqGtIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 8}}
