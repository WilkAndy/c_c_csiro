Heat transfer resulting from conduction and radiation and solidification of the lava modelled via a variable viscosity are coupled to the fluid flow solution. Simulations show that the run-out distance and the nature of the lava flow are affected significantly by the lava viscosity and that this is dependent on the scale of the volcanic eruption, with solidification effects strongest on the smallest scale. SPH appears to be a highly effective technique for predicting lava flow with very good representations of the fluid free surface, close interaction with the complex topography, easy inclusion of the thermal and solidification effects leading to very plausible flow predictions.
