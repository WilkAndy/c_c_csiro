Two different tank configurations are considered with 2 fill levels (20%, 70%) and 2 different oscillation amplitudes (10% and 20% of the tank dimension). Predicted pressure signals are compared to experimental measurements. The peak pressure values predicted in the simulations are generally lower than the experimental values, although they are the correct order of magnitude. While the stochastic nature of the oscillations in practice means that an exact match between simulation and experiment is not feasible, the statistics of the pressure signals allow a more meaningful comparison. Also presented are ensemble-averaged pressure traces and standard deviations of the pressure from the simulation results and a sub-set of the experimental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8481199379370866788", "cites_id": ["8481199379370866788"], "pub_url": "https://onepetro.org/IJOPE/article-abstract/29370/Simulation-of-Liquid-Sloshing-In-Model-LNG-Tank", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZPipdOZFs3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
