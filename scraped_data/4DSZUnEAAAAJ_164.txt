In addition, some knowledge of the response of the process condition to manipulation of the control variables is needed. One approach to sensing the charge status is by passive measurement of the vibrations on the surface of the mill. Vibrations are generated by collisions between grinding media, ore particles and the mill body. Changes to the vibration signal can indicate changes in charge characteristics such as motion and volumetric filling, hence providing a warning of the onset of sub-optimal or undesirable operating conditions.An AMIRA project has been established to investigate this promising technology using surface vibrations measured by accelerometers mounted directly on the rotating mill shell. Already, plant trials have shown the monitoring technique is sensitive to alterations in both the physical state of the mill and the operating conditions. Also, vibration data can be used as an input to soft-sensor models that provide valuable"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14300188113900636296", "cites_id": ["14300188113900636296"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven-Spencer-7/publication/291046663_SAG_mill_monitoring_using_surface_vibrations/links/598bb13f458515c333a33ee7/SAG-mill-monitoring-using-surface-vibrations.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iIhP7lJ5dMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 6, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
