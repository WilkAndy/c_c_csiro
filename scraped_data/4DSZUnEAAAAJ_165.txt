The ability to use such models to assist in faster and lower cost design of new comminution devices and in the improvement of existing ones will be critical to the ability of industry to respond to the substantive challenges facing mineral processing in the next decade. These challenges are reviewed and drivers for change are discussed. Understanding individual unit process performance needs to be in the context of the flowsheets in which they are used so this is also reviewed. Advances in particle based comminution modelling are presented with this work divided into two parts. This first part focuses on recent advances in particle based modelling of crushing. Three crusher types are used to demonstrate these capabilities:1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6027779822024972052", "cites_id": ["6027779822024972052"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X20303243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FNcQxM_5plMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
