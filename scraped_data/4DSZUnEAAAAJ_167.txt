For mills, scale-up is made difficult by the different rates at which different physical processes occurring within the machine change with the increasing size. Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling can now be performed at a range of scales and can be used to help understand scale-up issues for mills. This paper explores the ways in which DEM can be used to assist in the scale-up process for a mill using the HICOM mill as a case study. By choosing speeds at each mill size that have the same charge distribution and structure a scale-up relationship is developed which allows prediction of the power draw with increasing mill size. Similar scale-up relationships are developed for the specific power intensity and the most common collision energy occurring within the charge.
