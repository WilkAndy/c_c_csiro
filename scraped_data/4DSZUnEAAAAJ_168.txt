This appears to be the first application of the SPH technique to fully model a high pressure nozzle. The model predicts the internal flow and pressure distribution and enables exploration of the role of the internal geometric insert used in this design of the nozzle. It also predicts exit velocities from the nozzle as well as the pressure distribution generated by the nozzle and droplet size distribution of the resulting spray. Three different nozzle inflow rates were simulated and for all cases the numerical simulation of nozzle and spray gave generally good agreement with experiments, but complete agreement was not achieved. For better agreement, higher resolution for the SPH solution is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7711739440591202790", "cites_id": ["7711739440591202790"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250917307716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5unOpCmaBWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
