This can provide valuable insight into opportunities for designing mitigation strategies and to enable more informed management of such disaster scenarios. For the prediction of fluid-based geo-hazards, such as dam breaks, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method is ideally suited to predicting the resulting complex highly three-dimensional free surfaces flows, which involve splashing, fragmentation and interaction with complex topography and engineering structures. For landsides, which are collision dominated flows of rocks, the discrete element method provides an ideal method for prediction. In all cases, the quality of prediction is controlled by the availability of high-quality digital terrain data produced typically by photogrammetry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14846802666330332887", "cites_id": ["14846802666330332887"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19479832.2010.491801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1x7xAF1wCs4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
