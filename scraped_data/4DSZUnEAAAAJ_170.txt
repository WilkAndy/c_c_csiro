The charge motion is analysed using two different approaches, (1) a fluid only model, and (2) a 1-way coupled DEM + SPH model. The flow pattern when the classifier is closed is regular with a pair of oppositely oriented vortices between each pair of grinding discs. A strong radial outflow from the middle of the classifier is generated by the high centrifugal force which creates a pair of toroidal vortices at the discharge end of the mill. The classifier, when open, acts as a pump drawing slurry axially along the mill. It enters the classifier through the holes in its end plate and is then forced radially outward by rotational acceleration of the classifier cage. The enhanced outflow significantly strengthens the large toroidal vortices on the outside of the classifier. This produces a strong retrograde annular flow along \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11796120552878653341", "cites_id": ["11796120552878653341"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687515001533", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nT8E8iQ9tKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
