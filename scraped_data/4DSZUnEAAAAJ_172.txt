A generic geological system that represents a magmatic body intruded into upper-crustal rocks typical of the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia is modelled using SPH in order to explore patterns of fracture development around such a body. The SPH method is first validated via a uniaxial test problem. A coupled elastic deformation-fluid flow-thermal analysis is conducted to model the fracturing of rocks surrounding the magmatic intrusion, including the effects of pre-tensile and pre-compressive geotechnical strains in the rocks. The SPH method was found to be effective in capturing discrete fracturing processes caused by intruding magma which cannot be easily \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12099288499392023136", "cites_id": ["12099288499392023136"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10596-014-9437-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YAo7EclO6acJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
