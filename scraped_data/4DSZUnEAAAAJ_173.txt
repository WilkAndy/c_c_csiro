Factors investigated are the particle attributes (aspect ratio, angularity and particle size distribution) and the inter-particle contact friction. Fitted response surfaces to the friction and repose angles are used to determine the most significant factors controlling the critical angles and investigate the relationships between them."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2152449120748955392", "cites_id": ["2152449120748955392"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf12/PDFs/152MEA.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AOdXNxIJ3x0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
