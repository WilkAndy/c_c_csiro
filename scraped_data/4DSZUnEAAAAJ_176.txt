The particle trajectories are non-trivial due to recirculation regions resulting from the use of mixing impellers. These regions can greatly influence the segregation and mixing of materials.Three-dimensional simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) have been performed to investigate high shear mixing in a granular bed. A vertical cylindrical mixer was used. Two types of mixing impeller were considered: a vertical rectangular blade and a horizontal bottom disc, each rotating at 100 rpm. Simulations demonstrated that the degree to which the bed is mixed is sensitive to the shape of the impeller. In visually tracing the interchange of particles between different sections of the bed (by colouring the particles according to their initial positions in either quadrants or annuli) we can directly identify radial and angular mixing patterns for each case \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=920255983668450621", "cites_id": ["920255983668450621"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul-Cleary-5/publication/237816392_3D_DEM_simulations_of_a_High_Shear_Mixer/links/0c96052b09f7701b59000000/3D-DEM-simulations-of-a-High-Shear-Mixer.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PVX8APFnxQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
