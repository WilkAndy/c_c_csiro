Introduction Smoothed particle hydrodynamics is a particle based Lagrangian fluid dynamics simulation technique. The Navier-Stokes equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using an interpolation formula. Gradients, such as for pres-sure, are converted to forces between the particles. The particles then move about in response to the interplay of all the forces considered. This technique has many advantages including easy handling of free surfaces and complex boundaries, and the addition of complicated physics. It is also robust and versatile and is easily gener-alised to three dimensions. It has been applied to a large range of problems in both geophysical and astrophysical situations,(see [1] for a summary). The extension to incompressible free surface flows with boundaries is a recent de-velopment [2]. The results so far have been impressive, but there remain aspects that are not fully understood. In particular, the nature of the fluid particle-boundary interaction is examined here. We apply the method to a range of standard CFD problems in order to study these and other aspects of its behaviour."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6481401400265797071", "cites_id": ["6481401400265797071"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SQhqEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA157&dq=info:z-2PzTuQ8lkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=mIGaK9XzHm&sig=Uq0zRau9_pZg0AjcxuMtypcfK4k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z-2PzTuQ8lkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
