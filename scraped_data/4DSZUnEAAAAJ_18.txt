Earlier studies explored the effect of attributes such as shear rate, particle size and domain scale on the distribution of the particles in the flow, velocity profiles and the stress distributions. These studies were conducted using simple shapes for the particles such as spheres. In recent years, the importance of particle shape on flow has been recognized in a range of industrial application including mixing, comminution, hopper discharge and chute flows. In this paper, we return to the simple shear flows and quantitatively explore the effect of particle shape on velocity, volume fraction, granular temperature and stress distributions across the channel. Particle shape is found to sharply increase the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8037723150147209629", "cites_id": ["8037723150147209629"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591007003038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nUl1j566i28J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 12, "2011": 12, "2012": 13, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 20, "2016": 10, "2017": 15, "2018": 14, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 16, "2022": 9, "2023": 7}}
