Improving our understanding of such packings has wide spread applicability, from simple issues of grain transportation, to large geological events such as landslides. We have studied the properties of dense jammed packings for an extensive range of three\u2010dimensional particle shapes. We employ super\u2010quadric particles, which allow us to vary the particle\u2019s aspect ratio, surface curvature and blockiness. We explore how the individual particle shape affects both the macroscopic and the local configurational properties of the system, smoothly transitioning from spherical particles possessing only translational degrees of freedom to large aspect ratio non\u2010spherical grains where rotational degrees of freedom are highly important. Finally, we demonstrate how a fundamental understanding of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=20889564732618752", "cites_id": ["20889564732618752"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3180058", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AHhmzfI2SgAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 7}}
