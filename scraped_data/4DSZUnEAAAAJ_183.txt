The sample configurations investigated here are full-size high-flow-rate configurations typical of mineral and bulk materials applications. Detailed quantitative information on overall extraction ratios, size specific extraction ratios, missed and extra sample components can be made by comparing a reference sample to the actual sample. A key advantage of using this modelling approach over physical experimentation is that the reference sample can be measured on precisely the same portion of the stream of material as the actual sample, thereby allowing the elimination of a significant fraction of the variability and allowing statistically significant results to be obtained using many fewer replicates. Quantitative analysis of results broadly supports the commonly used rule that the cutter aperture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5759520215485346930", "cites_id": ["5759520215485346930"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250908000912", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cnSv6B7t7U8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
