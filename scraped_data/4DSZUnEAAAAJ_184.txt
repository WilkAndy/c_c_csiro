The binary collisions of the latter are governed by the same forces as those governing the discrete elements. Both methods are applied to a granular shear flow of equally sized discs and spheres. The two dimensional implementation of the kinetic approach shows excellent agreement with the results of the discrete element simulations. During change to a three dimensional velocity space, the qualitative features of the flow are maintained. However, some flow properties change quantitatively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5595633027994475924", "cites_id": ["5595633027994475924"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999199962927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lN0Nj5eup00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
