Three mechanisms that can lead to sampling bias are identified and discussed at the particle level. They all tend to lead to undersampling of large particles compared to small particles. One of these mechanisms was investigated using two-dimensional modelling of sample cutters, including at least 46 simulation runs for each of 23 different sets of conditions. The configurations satisfying standard sampling criteria demonstrated biases ranging from 2.4% to 1.6% in a size score, indicating that large particles are under-sampled. They also showed extraction ratios substantially below the desirable levels because of particle hold up in the region above the cutter blades. The sensitivity of the sampling to the cutter aperture, cutter blade thickness and tip shape \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12160991688648417547", "cites_id": ["12160991688648417547"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687599000953", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C-FdVoKFxKgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2}}
