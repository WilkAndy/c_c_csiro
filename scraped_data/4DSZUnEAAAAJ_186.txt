The underlying fluid simulation is based on the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. Vapour bubbles are created at nucleation sites when they reach suitable superheat temperatures above the boiling point. Rising bubbles grow or shrink in the fluid depending on the local superheat of the fluid. The bubbles burst at the fluid free surface and create jets of steam particles and small sprays of liquid drops. This model contains significant bubble scale physics and allows the capturing of key processes that cannot be directly modeled by traditional methods. The method provides the visual artist control over several key aspects of the bubble nucleation, generation, growth and interaction with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6171601076554908495", "cites_id": ["6171601076554908495"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849315001442", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T0N5B3vupVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
