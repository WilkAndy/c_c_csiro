One configuration, which is a transverse slice through a membrane type tank, is studied here. Two fill levels (20, 70%) and two different oscillation amplitudes (10 and 20% of the tank dimension) are considered. Predicted pressure signals are compared to experimental measurements. The peak pressure values predicted in the simulations are generally lower than the experimental values, although they are the correct order of magnitude. The stochastic nature of the oscillations in practice means that an exact match between simulation and experiment is not feasible. Ensemble averaged pressure traces and standard deviations of the pressure from the simulation results are also presented. They show generally higher variability in the pressure signals for low fill ratio compared to high fill. The magnitude of fluctuations is also sensitive to the sensor location. SPH provides results for the peak pressures that are the correct order of magnitude on average, although the highest peaks are under-predicted. It is a natural technique for such coupled fluid-structure problems with large free surface deformations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15960782678091442459", "cites_id": ["15960782678091442459"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP092087&dsid=DS2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GynZKEgXgN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
