Three-dimensional simulations of high pressure die casting are presented for two realistic dies. Developments needed for both visualisation of these systems and for their simulation are described. Comparison of SPH and MAGMAsoft simulations with experimental results from water analogue modelling are made for gravity die casting. The SPH comparisons are particularly good, with the method able to capture the fine details of the free surface motion, including plume shape, frequency and phase of oscillation and the correct relative heights of all the free surfaces."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 194, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4786604510252060047", "cites_id": ["4786604510252060047"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X01000543", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j03bCXFvbUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 9, "2005": 8, "2006": 13, "2007": 7, "2008": 9, "2009": 10, "2010": 12, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 18, "2016": 13, "2017": 7, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
