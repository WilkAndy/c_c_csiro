Tasks include simpler steps such as copying and transforming files to using mesh generation or visualisation software to create inputs or to analyse outputs. Typically, these sequences involve manual steps which are time expensive, often involve use of multiple, incompatible software tools of various levels of usability, which are usually not well documented, and so create significant challenges for provenance, reproducibility and transfer to other users. These semi-manual workflows also inhibit sharing of capabilities and commercialisation. This paper explores how the adoption of the scientific workflow system Workspace can significantly improve such research and engineering activities by streamlining and automating the workflows involved. Benefits ensue in terms of improved collaboration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5092536740971672908", "cites_id": ["5092536740971672908"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475419303441", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TPU9Oy9TrEYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
