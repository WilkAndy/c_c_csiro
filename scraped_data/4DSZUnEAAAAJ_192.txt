A 1.8-m diameter pilot scale SAG mill which includes realistic end walls and a discharge grate is used. This size of mill is used for scale-up and design processes for industrial SAG mills so understanding the effect of approximating the particles as being spherical or non-round is important. The cataracting component of the flow is found to be insensitive to the particle shape used in the model but the cascading part of the flow is moderately sensitive with the shoulder moving slightly higher, the bulk toe moving closer into the charge and the centre of circulation moving more strongly higher. The end walls are found to have a strong effect on the flow dominating the dynamics in the outmost parts of the charge and strengthening the particle microstructure via the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13115147474450376203", "cites_id": ["13115147474450376203"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40571-019-00226-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C-Z5FyRdArYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
