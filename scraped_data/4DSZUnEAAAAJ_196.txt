By varying the gap size between the lobes and pump housing, variations in pump efficiency and shear stress were determined. The simulations indicated that pump shear was dependent on gap size, with shear stress levels (0\u201340 Pa) correlating with those estimated in previous albumin\u2010pumping studies. As gap size increased, the number of fluid particles experiencing low shear (<10 Pa) increased, whereas those experiencing high shear (>20 Pa) showed a decreasing trend. The pump efficiency, however, decreased with gap size, requiring more lobe revolutions to pass a unit volume. Taken together, these observations indicate that lobe pumps operated with increased gaps between the rotors and the housing result in larger number of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3670160133413064701", "cites_id": ["3670160133413064701"], "pub_url": "https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1042/BA20050188", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_c_iLDIH7zIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
