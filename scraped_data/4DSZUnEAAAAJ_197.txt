The fine product from coarse particle fracture can then be included in the slurry phase modelled using SPH. This allows, in principle, the prediction of the breakage and transport of coarser material and the transport of the finer material within the grinding and pulp chambers of a SAG mill including discharge performance of the mill. It also allows the effect of the changing solids loading on the slurry rheology to be included. In this paper we will explore the development of an extension of this model that also allows prediction of the grinding of the finer particles embedded in the slurry phase due to the collisions and shear of the coarser particles (rocks and grinding media). The size distribution of the slurry fines is discretised into a set of size fractions so that its change due to grinding can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3506479580111387792", "cites_id": ["3506479580111387792"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687520304349", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kDyzmJmEqTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
