The use of a Lagrangian method enables simulation of extruders partially or fully filled with fluid and is not limited by problems associated with extreme mesh deformation due to the opposite rotation of the impellors or the small gaps between them. The cross-channel and axial fluid transport and mixing in the screw elements and kneading blocks are analysed. The effect of parametric variations in both impeller elements on the nature of the fluid flow and the mixing are explored; specifically the effects of varying the screw pitch (positively correlated to mixing rate), kneading block stagger angle (the mixing rate peaks at a block angle of 30\u00b0) and gap size between the rotating elements (positively correlated to mixing rate).
