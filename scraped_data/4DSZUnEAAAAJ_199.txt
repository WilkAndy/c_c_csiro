An extension of this model is proposed in which breakage of coarser particles (which are resolved in the DEM sub-model) in accordance with the incremental damage theory is included. This allows direct prediction of the resident size distribution of the rock component of the charge. It also allows the finer unresolved progeny from the breakage to be added to the slurry whose rheological properties then become a dynamic prediction of the model via the evolving local solids density of the slurry. It also allows transport of the fine material within and from the mill to be predicted. This model is demonstrated for an industry standard 1.8\u202fm diameter by 0.6\u202fm long pilot SAG mill. It allows the nature of the damage accumulation by the rock particles and its linkage to the flow structure of the charge to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16152049098664766425", "cites_id": ["16152049098664766425"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687518303789", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2euU-BObJ-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
