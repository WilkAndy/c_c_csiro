There are a number of contact force models implemented in DEM that incorporate viscous or plastic dissipation but their validation is a difficult process given their performance is likely problem dependent. In this context, we examine the accuracy of two DEM viscous dissipation models (where the energy is dissipated through a dashpot mechanism) in simulating a simple inelastic oblique impact. We compare the rebound kinematics at various impact angles for a wide range of normal coefficients of restitutions for two types of dashpot models against previously validated plastic dissipation models. We discuss two important results. The first is that for high coefficients of restitutions both dashpot models behave similarly and compare well to plastic dissipation models. However as the coefficient of restitution decreases (and the energy dissipation increases) both dashpot models produce increasingly damped tangential forces and velocities. This is entirely different behaviour to the validated plastic dissipation models which show increasingly oscillatory tangential forces and velocities as the coefficient of restitution decreases. The final key result is the appropriate choice of the damping coefficient in the viscous dissipation models to ensure the normal coefficient of restitution is correctly reproduced."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13288753607252249347", "cites_id": ["13288753607252249347"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2012/CFD2012/PDFs/175CUM.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Awv2u_8ia7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
