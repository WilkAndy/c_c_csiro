The development of cutting tools with extended tool life will have a major impact on the economic feasibility of mechanical rock excavation. CSIRO has been developing Super Material Abrasive Resistant Tool (SMART* CUT). It is aimed at providing an effective cutting tool for mining and civil industries to deal with hard rock cutting and helping to improve productivity and reduce operating costs. The two key elements of SMART* CUT technology are replacing conventional tungsten carbide (WC) with thermally stable diamond composite (TSDC) as cutting tip of the tool and using CSIRO worldwide patented bonding technology to attach the TSDC tip to the steel tool body. To ensure successful application of SMART* CUT for different mechanical rock excavation machines, cutter head design software has been developed. Additionally, 3D thermo-mechanical numerical models of linear and rotary rock cutting and tool body protection technologies are being developed. The main advantages of SMART* CUT over conventional tungsten carbide tools are described. The challenges faced by SMART* CUT and the further developments needed are also discussed in this paper. Using SMART* CUT picks, hard rock with UCS as high as 260 MPa have been effectively cut in laboratory tests. CSIRO is cooperating with industrial partners to conduct field trials for SMART* CUT technology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17802734796604698082", "cites_id": ["17802734796604698082"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bulent-Tiryaki/publication/270159505_HARD_ROCK_CUTTING_WITH_SMARTCUT_TECHNOLOGY/links/54a1709e0cf257a636036ea1/HARD-ROCK-CUTTING-WITH-SMARTCUT-TECHNOLOGY.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4u0bfvkEEPcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
