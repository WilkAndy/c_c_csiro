It provides detailed information on bias and size-dependant extraction ratios based on closely matched reference and actual samples taken from the same simulations. It has allowed the identification of operational and design parameters which influence sample cutter performance and bias. To date, only cohesionless bulk materials have been considered. Wet bulk materials typically become sticky and this strongly influences their flow behaviour and particularly the mobility of fine particles and the overall flowability of the material. The inclusion of cohesion in DEM simulation of flow from a head pulley shows that the falling stream breaks up into large fragments that move as rigid bodies. The size of these fragments depends on the degree of cohesion. The effect of cohesion on sampler performance is explored.
