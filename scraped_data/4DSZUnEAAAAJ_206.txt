The HICOM 110 mill was used as a case study to demonstrate how such a model can be used to help understand the full life cycle performance of a mill. This mill was chosen because of the availability of validated calibration constants for the wear model for this mill. The comparison of the evolution sequences shows that initial small differences in wear profiles for different lifters can lead to quote a different life cycle behaviour \u2014 both for the erosion behaviour of the liner and for the performance of the mill. They also demonstrate that the wear predicted for the new liner does not necessarily well reflect the whole of life wear process as the feedback between the wear and flow can strongly influence the liner life cycle."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7612032776848818612", "cites_id": ["7612032776848818612"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751614001677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tEG08npfo2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
