This is usually carried out in either a dilute phase, in which the particles are effectively suspended in the gas phase, or a dense phase, in which the particles move in a bulk flow. Dense phase conveying is becoming increasingly popular as it reduces collisional and abrasional forces on both the particles and the walls, reducing breakage and wear in the system. The motion of the particles is difficult to capture experimentally making computational simulation of such systems invaluable for understanding their dynamics. Previous experimental and computational studies have investigated both horizontal and vertical dense conveying and the effect of gas flow velocity and pressure on the bulk particle flow rate. It has also been found that the formation and movement of slugs of particles in a wave-like motion in the direction of the flow accounts for the majority of the bulk flow in the system. However, most simulations have modelled the particles as spheres, which is a considerable approximation as many particles in industrial applications are non-spherical. We explore the role of shape in horizontal dense phase pneumatic conveying by investigating how cubical and elliptical particles change the dynamics of the system. We compare both slug formation and the movement of slugs to the spherical case and show the bulk flow is highly sensitive to particle shape."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5481948726345719512", "cites_id": ["5481948726345719512"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf09/PDFs/120HIL.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2N69blLLE0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
