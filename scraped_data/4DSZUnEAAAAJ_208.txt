Two different mooring configurations are considered: A Tension Leg Platform (TLP) system and a Taut Spread Mooring (TSM) system. It is seen that for a wave impact normal to the platform side, the heave and surge responses of the platform are significantly different for the two mooring systems. The TLP system undergoes large surge but comparatively smaller heave motions than the TSM system. The degree of pitch is very similar. The total tension in the mooring cables is approximately four times higher in the TSM system and exceeds the strength of the cables used in the simulation. SPH is seen to be an attractive alternative to standard methods for simulating the coupled interaction of highly non-linear breaking waves and structural motion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17383804324698902935", "cites_id": ["17383804324698902935"], "pub_url": "https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/OMAE/proceedings-abstract/OMAE2008/887/329469", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l9GTEu6tP_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
