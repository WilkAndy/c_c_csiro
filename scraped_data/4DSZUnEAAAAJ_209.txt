Predictions of the isothermal filling of a moderately complex die in 3D demonstrates the importance of flow separation off corners, edges and faces with high curvature and the non-intuitive order of fill resulting from complicated back flows. The free surface behaviour involves significant transient void formation and free surface fragmentation. The predictions are shown to be insensitive to the Reynolds numbers. Their accuracy is confirmed by comparing simulations with coarser and finer resolutions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8672374793484920352", "cites_id": ["8672374793484920352"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/136404605225022892", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IGa4LO12WngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
