We obtain a convective surface layer extending into the particle bed some 10 particle di-ameters from the surface. This surface convective motion can give rise to a \u201creverse Muesli effect\u201d, ie where the large particles, initially, move to-wards the bottom of the particle bed. For particle beds with heights greater than 10 particle diameters, and for I\" 2, 1.2, one obtains interior, counter-convective rolls, where the material travels down the vertical side walls and up the center of the pile. This latter result is consistent with experimental observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2309071543454186802", "cites_id": ["2309071543454186802"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf97/papers/lif006.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mr2MtFV4CyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
