This is based on the idea that particles near the ends of the rolls are less well confined which makes them more mobile with reduced ability to be trapped and crushed. This can reduce the performance efficiency of a HPGR quite significantly. Experimental measurement of this axial pressure distribution and its consequences for the breakage efficiency, particularly at industrial scale, is very difficult. So little is known about its nature or how this may change with choice of confining structures (such as cheek plates). This problem is tractable using DEM to predict the coupled flow and breakage of particles within the HPGR. A replacement strategy is used where particles are broken when the applied force exceeds a size dependent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12479071823906639907", "cites_id": ["12479071823906639907"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687520305896", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I5CK9rSRLq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
