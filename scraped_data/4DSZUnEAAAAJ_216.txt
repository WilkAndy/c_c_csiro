The proposed modelling technique is illustrated by simulating a simple setup of an arc welding process. The plastic deformation and temperature distribution in the weld pool and the surrounding parent material are analysed using SPH. This work establishes the capability of SPH in gaining insight into the material deposition and its subsequent evolution, and predicting plastic deformation and heat transfer in welding processes. This can then be used to evaluate the generation of thermal stresses and the change in mechanical and metallurgical properties in the weld pool and the adjacent Heat Affected Zone (HAZ)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6266806209722657252", "cites_id": ["6266806209722657252"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/41383016/Modelling_Plastic_Deformation_and_Therma20160121-10149-a2eoae.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5Cm7dgsr-FYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
