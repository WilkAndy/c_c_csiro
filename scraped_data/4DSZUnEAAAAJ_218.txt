Degradation of the material and variable packing in the screw pitches are some of the significant operational concerns. This paper explores the effect that particle shape has on the material\u2019s behaviour in screw conveyors. Specifically, faceted polyhedral particles are considered and computed on GPUs using the DEM code, Blaze-DEM. Particle shape significantly influences bulk discharge characteristics, in particular, for higher rotation speeds of the screw. Although spheres yield similar bulk discharge rates to symmetric and equiaxed polyhedra at lower rotational speeds, the packing structure and collision dynamics within the screw are shown to be significantly different between the particle shapes. In general polyhedra have a larger fraction of normal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9304021496184849272", "cites_id": ["9304021496184849272"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250921002190", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eEOyhkGGHoEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
