The model uses the discrete element method (DEM) for powder flow simulation, an extended smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for melt pool dynamics and a semi-empirical microstructure evolution strategy to simulate the evolving temperature and microstructure of non-spherical Ti-6Al-4V powder grains undergoing L-PBF. The highly novel use of both DEM and SPH means that varied physics such as collisions between non-spherical powder grains during the coating process and heat transfer, melting, solidification and microstructure evolution during the laser fusion process can be simulated. The new capability is demonstrated by applying a complex representative laser scan pattern to a single-layer Ti-6Al-4V powder bed. It is found that the fast cooling rate primarily leads to a transition between the \u03b2 and \u03b1 martensitic phases. A minimal production of the \u03b1 Widmanstatten phase at the outer edge of the laser is also noted due to an in situ heat treatment effect of the martensitic grains near the laser. This work demonstrates the potential of the coupled DEM/SPH computational model as a realistic tool to investigate the effect of process parameters such as powder morphology, laser scan speed and power characteristics on the Ti-6Al-4V powder bed microstructure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4887043279002099279", "cites_id": ["4887043279002099279"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1122366", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T17hNvhD0kMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
