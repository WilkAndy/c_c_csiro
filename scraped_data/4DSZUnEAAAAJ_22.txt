Sometimes it is desirable to enhance the mixing and inhibit segregation and in other cases it is desirable to minimise the mixing and enhance the segregation. The fundamentals of these processes are poorly understood. Computational modelling of such granular flows offers a good opportunity to study these fundamentals. But how well do these discrete element based modelling techniques capture the essential features of mixing processes? The capabilities of our discrete element modelling package are described. Two different methods for measuring the rates of mixing are presented and three different configurations are studied. Qualitatively reasonable flows are obtained. A detailed study of the mixing demonstrates that the amount and nature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 171, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8454095770488273633", "cites_id": ["8454095770488273633"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X9810032X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4foVwU_7UnUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 13, "2009": 10, "2010": 4, "2011": 12, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
