It is illustrated by simulating a simple arc welding configuration. A multi-physics framework is used for solving the fully coupled elastoplastic and thermal analysis. Both the plastic deformation and temperature distribution of the metal in the weld pool and the surrounding parent material are analysed using SPH, and the resulting residual thermal stresses are evaluated. The effects of the depth, angle, and profile of a weld groove on the resultant plastic strain distribution in the weld pool are studied. This work establishes the capability of SPH as a tool for gaining insight into the material deposition and its subsequent evolution during welding processes, demonstrating that predictions of plastic deformation, heat transfer, and residual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3930162981146429813", "cites_id": ["3930162981146429813"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10999-014-9279-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dYmfkGi-ijYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
