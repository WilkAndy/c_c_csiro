Insight into the degree of practical variation in the flood behaviours that can be generated by both the presence of dam wall fragments and the collapse sequence is investigated via a case study using key locations downstream of the Geheyan Dam, Hubei, China. Scenarios considered include ones initiated by seismic fracture, overtopping and foundation failure. The nature of the scenario determines the rate of increase of area of the breach and therefore the discharge flow rate, which in turn strongly influences the extent and timing of inundation for timescales of up to 1\u2009h and distances of up to 10\u2009km from the dam wall. Beyond this, the influence of the specific scenario \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4394119632801919459", "cites_id": ["4394119632801919459"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19479832.2012.716084", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:43G6ZYYM-zwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
