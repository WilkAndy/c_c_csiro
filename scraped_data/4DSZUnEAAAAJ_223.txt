This dependence on liquid separation has an environmental impact in terms of energy and water use and also implies a cap on production due to the availability of water. To address these problems, the CSIRO has developed the CSIRO Rotational Classifier, which - by using the phenomena of rotational segregation - can quickly separate dry granular material in terms of size and/or density without the use of any liquids. The purpose of this paper is to obtain a deeper understanding of how rotational segregation can separate particles of different densities in a rotating cylinder, free from any interstitial fluids. This was accomplished by analyzing a cross section at the 20% fill level in a 50% full classifier, which contained a 50-50 ratio of glass and lead beads. The granular bed was sampled at different time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1606198515751153359", "cites_id": ["1606198515751153359"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7270/727010/Density-segregation-of-granular-material-in-a-rotating-cylindrical-tumbler/10.1117/12.814431.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z24bQgpdShYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
