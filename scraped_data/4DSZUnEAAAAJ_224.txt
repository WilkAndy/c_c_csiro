Conf. on CFD in Minerals & Process Industries", "abstract": "This paper reports on the application of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and MAGMAsoft to model the High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) of an automotive piston head. The geometric complexity and high speed involved in HPDC lead to strongly three dimensional fluid flow with significant free surface fragmentation and splashing. SPH is a Lagrangian simulation technique that is particularly well suited to modelling HPDC, whilst Magmasoft is a commercial finite volume based casting package. In SPH, materials are approximated by particles that are free to move around rather than by fixed grids.Validation of SPH and MAGMAsoft predictions for the casting of a servo piston head using water analogue experiments are presented. The overall flows predicted by both methods are broadly similar, but the SPH simulation results were better able to capture the fine detail of the fluid motion and splashing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17699190151765412570", "cites_id": ["17699190151765412570"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/32518683/043Ha.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2soRMKsnoPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
