To accurately model these real-world collisions the forces arising due to elastoplastic deformation and friction need to be modelled accurately. In this study the use of frictional boundary conditions in modeling elastic collisions with Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is explored. The collision dynamics for an oblique impact of a 3D spherical granule on an elastic substrate is assessed for SPH (a) without any special treatment for friction and (b) using Coulomb's friction model, and it is identified that these approaches are inaccurate in some instances. To resolve this, spring-based contact models are incorporated in SPH to develop a new method for improved contact modeling. We call this method Collisional SPH. This Collisional SPH method predicts both rebound kinematics \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17469635443453322178", "cites_id": ["17469635443453322178"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X21000135", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wuObsuCccPIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
