Poor transport of finer ground material can adversely affect grinding leading to excess energy consumption and over-grinding of fine material. This paper extends a 1-way coupled DEM-SPH method to three dimensions and applies it to a 1.8 m diameter by 0.6 m long AG/SAG pilot mill. This provides detailed information on the internal flow of slurry within a SAG mill, including the prediction of dry regions and of slurry pooling. Full 3D analysis also allows the pulp flow patterns into and out of the mill via pulp lifter chamber to be investigated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9825418854032590767", "cites_id": ["9825418854032590767"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116825&sb=RECENT&n=47&rpp=50&page=20&tr=5035&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r8cJ9GPmWogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
