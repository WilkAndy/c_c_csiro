This is the first stage in a larger study to better understand the mechanics of bucket elevator operation with reference to the discharge of particles at the head end. At the head end two issues arise; mechanically, the buckets are bolted to the conveying media (typically a fabric reinforced belt) and at the point of belt to headpulley tangency, the tip of the bucket undergoes a theoretical step change in velocity. This theoretical step change results in a classical under-damped response in the buckets tip velocity. In undergoing this motion, there are stresses that are passed to the carcass of the conveying media; understanding the magnitude of these stresses is one longer term goal of this research allowing a quantitative basis for the existing qualitative design \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17814730560928570874", "cites_id": ["17814730560928570874"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-010-0243-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-l1xBQ-jOvcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
