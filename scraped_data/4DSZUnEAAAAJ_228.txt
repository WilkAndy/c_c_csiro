We show that the flow rate increases in response to the applied shear. This increase obeys a power-law relation based on the rotational Froude number, , where  is the angular rotation speed and  is a system length scale. The exponent of this relation is found to be independent of the particle diameter, intergrain friction, and the geometry of the setup."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16643667855499029238", "cites_id": ["16643667855499029238"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3459155", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9mqbjrsv-uYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
