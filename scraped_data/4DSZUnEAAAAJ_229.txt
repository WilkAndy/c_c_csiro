Melbourne, Australia", "pages": "9-11", "abstract": "Large scale industrial screens are used extensively in separating particles by size into multiple product streams. Their performance in terms of throughput and screening efficiency is of vital economic and industrial importance, as in many applications this can be a limiting factor in the overall efficiency of multi-step industrial processes. Discrete Element Method (DEM) predictions of flow and separation efficiency using spherical particles are compared to experimental data in order to assess their accuracy. The apparatus consists of a laboratory scale horizontal screen with a wire mesh cloth onto which quarry rock is feed at a series of flow rates. The screen is vibrated causing the granular bed to flow over the deck and causing it to vertically stratify with finer material passing through the screen to be collected below for analysis. Product mass and size distribution data is collected in a series of bins located along the length of the screen allowing a detailed understanding of the progress of the separation to be developed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3047601617276459959", "cites_id": ["3047601617276459959"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2009/PDFs/126DEL.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t1urJoZBSyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
