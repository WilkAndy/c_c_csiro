A Lagrangian simulation technique that is particularly well suited to modelling HPDC is smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Materials are approximated by particles that are free to move around rather than by fixed grids, enabling the accurate prediction of fluid flows involving complex free surface motion. Validation of isothermal SPH flow predictions for the casting of a servo piston head using water analogue experiments is presented. Comparison with MAGMAsoft predictions provides information of the relative strengths of these two approaches. The SPH simulations were better able to capture the key details of the fluid motion and splashing, particularly the relative rates of flow around sharp bends and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 164, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16844882255013220897", "cites_id": ["16844882255013220897"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X06000357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IRJYtSkLxekJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 11, "2011": 14, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 18, "2016": 16, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
