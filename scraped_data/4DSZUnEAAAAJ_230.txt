Conf. on CFD in Minerals and Process Industries", "pages": "421-426", "abstract": "The geometric complexity and high fluid speeds involved in High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) combine to give strongly three dimensional fluid flow with significant free surface fragmentation and splashing. A Lagrangian simulation technique that is particularly well suited to modelling HPDC is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Materials are approximated by particles that are free to move around rather than by fixed grids, enabling the accurate prediction of fluid flows involving complex free surface motion.Several automotive examples of SPH simulated HPDC flows are presented, ranging from simple cases such as a front servo piston to steering column components and a full engine rocker cover. These show unprecedented detail in the fluid free surfaces, particularly in the extent of fragmentation and void formation. Validation of isothermal and thermal/solidification predictions are also presented.
