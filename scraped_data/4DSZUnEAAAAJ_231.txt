We consider the controversial subject of the depression in the normal stress under the highest part of a sand pile. We find that piles composed of particles with the same size do not produce a stress depression, while piles composed of layers of particles of different sizes do show a stress depression which is similar to experimental observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=544351530574243790", "cites_id": ["544351530574243790"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf99/Conf99_Papers/065LIFF.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zmfRPNXsjQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1}}
