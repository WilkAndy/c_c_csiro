The spray is represented by discrete particles which can collide with solid objects, each other and also merge with liquid surfaces. The liquid pool dynamics are solved for using the SPH method. The proposed coupling allows momentum to be transferred from the discrete spray phase into the fluid phase in the pool. The performance of this coupled DEM-SPH method is evaluated by comparing to experiments performed for simple spray arrangements in which the pressure in the pool just above the solid surface is carefully measured by a probe that is moved systematically across the surface. A comparison of the simulated pressure distribution with those from the experiments shows very good agreement for the size of the high pressure region \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11264017954654704729", "cites_id": ["11264017954654704729"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X18306346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WdTQgqbUUZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
