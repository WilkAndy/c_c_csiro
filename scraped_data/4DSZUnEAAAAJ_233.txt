For the feed box, rocks were fed into the feed box from a conveyor and travelled through a series of intermediate ledges before being combined with water from an assembly of pipe jets and spray nozzles, and then exiting to the screen. Two dispersal geometries were considered for distributing the water. Wide nozzle sprays were found to provide much more uniform delivery of water to the rock stream than jets from cylindrical pipes. The details of the feed and slurry mixture exiting the bottom chute does not appear to change significantly with conveyor feed rate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5704656082618940568", "cites_id": ["5704656082618940568"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687517300833", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mPxFinsCK08J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
