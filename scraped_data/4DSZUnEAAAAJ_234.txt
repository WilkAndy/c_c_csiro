Due to the inaccessibility of the small and large bowel, obtaining detailed manometric measurements in the gut or visualizing the movement of digesta is difficult in vivo. Computational modelling that incorporates the complex interactions between gut content and wall contractility has the potential to explain the mechanisms behind propulsive motor patterns and aid the interpretation of manometric measurements. We present here a biomechanical computational model of coupled wall flexure and flow dynamics in a virtual segment of intestine. The model uses the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method which permits coupling of the fluid/solid motion and wall deformation in a natural way. Peristaltic waves of contraction and relaxation, similar to those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9500548605729516086", "cites_id": ["9500548605729516086"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40571-015-0050-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NirX75662IMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
