The use of a Lagrangian method enables simulation of real extruders without the difficulties associated with extreme mesh deformation due to the conflicting rotation of the impellors and the small gaps between them. The cross-channel and down-channel fluid transport and mixing in both fully flighted screw elements and kneading blocks is analysed. The effect of parametric variations in both mixing elements on the nature of the fluid flow and the mixing are explored; specifically the effects of varying the screw pitch, kneading block stagger angle and gap size between the rotating elements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9229454629746986446", "cites_id": ["9229454629746986446"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP112259&sb=RECENT&n=27&rpp=50&page=54&tr=5047&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zk2nBBacFYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
