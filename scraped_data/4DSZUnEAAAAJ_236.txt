A threedimensional dam-break flow with a rectangular column located downstream is considered. The net force exerted on the column is monitored throughout the simulation with the results correlating well with existing experimental data. Simulation parameters including: particle resolution, fluid viscosity, gate opening times and boundary treatments are varied and their affect on the load imparted to the column are investigated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17710004335043631736", "cites_id": ["17710004335043631736"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1c28b78333b4a89023e610041b09cbd337f64ed7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eFrncByTxvUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
