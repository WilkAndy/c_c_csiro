Conf. on CFD in the Minerals and Process Industries", "pages": "409-414", "abstract": "Full three dimensional SPH simulations of the aluminium ingot casting process were performed as part of a CAST project to develop and optimise a quality competitive high flow rate wheel design. The interior and exterior oxide content in the ingots was predicted using a linear oxide growth rate model based on exposure of fluid to the air. Simulation results were used to make design modifications to the wheel and launder design in order to minimise the oxide content in the cast ingots generated by the flow through the wheel and into the ingots. With a view to increasing the number of ingots produced per hour while maintaining the ingot quality, simulations were also carried out to compare the oxide content at two different feed rates of the molten aluminium. Results indicate that SPH can be employed as a useful tool for design optimization of such systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16564086074147017956", "cites_id": ["16564086074147017956"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matt-Sinnott/publication/311738262_3D_SPH_simulations_of_the_aluminium_ingot_casting_process/links/5858bbd008ae3852d254482f/3D-SPH-simulations-of-the-aluminium-ingot-casting-process.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5BSHLoZ03-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
