This needs to be done as e $ ciently as possible, maximizing mill throughput while minimizing operating costs. Such milling processes typically use only 1} 5 per cent of the supplied energy for particle breakage, which leaves room for improvement. In discrete element modelling (DEM) of granular# ows the trajectories, orientations and spins of all the particles and objects in the system are calculated and their interactions with other particles and with their environment are predicted. It is necessary to simulate particles of many di! erent sizes and densities interacting with complex-shaped objects moving in di! erent ways. Particle# ows in three types of mills; a 5 m ball mill, a 10 mm SAG mill and a 15 cm diameter centrifugal mill are predicted.
