Three-dimensional simulations were performed using the full Navier-Stokes equations with the particle-based Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Since SPH is mesh free it is well suited to simulating free-surface flows of this kind, involving splashing and fluid layer break up. This paper demonstrates the ability of the SPH method to handle these large geophysical phenomena having length scales of the order of kilometres. Due to computational limitations, the highest resolution for which simulations were carried out used a particle separation of around 6.0 m for a topographic area of approximately 15 sq km. An example of a potential dam breakage flow, and its interaction with the surrounding topography, is presented here."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12223004070631321421", "cites_id": ["12223004070631321421"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu.au/intranet/proceedings/14afmc/14AFMC/PDF/AUTHOR/FM010185.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TS8iJnHVoKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
