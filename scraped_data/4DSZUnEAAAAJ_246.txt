Early examples of the filling of simple dies in two dimensions demonstrate the complexity of the flow pattern and particularly the role of free surface behaviour and breakup. The effect of the inclusion of heat transfer on the filling of these simple dies is shown, particularly the effect of the thermal boundary condition on the inside of the die and the importance of modelling the coupled conduction into the die itself. Two examples of validation using water analogue experiments are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the SPH predictions. The extension of the modelling to 3D and the methodology used to represent complex three dimensional die shapes are described. The use of this SPH system to model the filling of a realistic industrial component is presented. The importance of the order of the die filling is shown as is the role of flow separation from corners and even moderately curved surfaces. The degree of surface fragmentation, droplet formation and the strongly transient nature of the voidage are also shown. Finally the filling of the runner, gate and die for a real automotive piston head is shown and the difficulties inherent in such large scale computations are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3552071561286287889", "cites_id": ["3552071561286287889"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul-Cleary-5/publication/246854585_Modelling_the_High_Pressure_Die_Casting_Process_Using_SPH/links/0c96053c3a9e638c12000000/Modelling-the-High-Pressure-Die-Casting-Process-Using-SPH.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EYI860N-SzEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
