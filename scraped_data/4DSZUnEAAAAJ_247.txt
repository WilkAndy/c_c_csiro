Typically, equipment that handles granular flows is large and expensive, so small improvements in efficiency can produce substantial economic benefits. Improved understanding of the behaviour of such granular flows can be used to improve processes, compare and improve designs, and reduce the length of development cycles. The capabilities of our simulation code are described, as are new developments in data collection and analysis. Flow in a ball mill and the construction of a stockpile are examined in detail."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4733325311840688114", "cites_id": ["4733325311840688114"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.718654475205020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8heh-komsEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1}}
