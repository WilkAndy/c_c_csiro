An alternative school of thought is that such large, long-lived and largely molten magma chambers are transient to non-existent in Earth\u2019s history. Our study of stratiform chromitites in the Bushveld Complex\u2014the largest magmatic body in the Earth\u2019s continental crust\u2014tells, however, a different story. Several chromitites in this complex occur as layers up to 2 m in thickness and more than 400 kms in lateral extent, implying that chromitite-forming events were chamber-wide phenomena. Field relations and microtextural data, specifically the relationship of 3D coordination number, porosity and grain size, indicate that the chromitites grew as a 3D framework of touching chromite grains directly at the chamber floor from a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8751009514340753226", "cites_id": ["8751009514340753226"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08110-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Sh9Y2MnUcXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
