The accuracy of the various models is assessed using quantitative data on shoulder, toe and vortex center positions taken from ensembles of both experimental and simulation results. These detailed comparisons reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the various models for simulating mills and allow the effect of different modelling assumptions to be quantitatively evaluated. In particular, very close agreement is demonstrated between the full 3D model (including the end wall effects) and the experiments. It is also demonstrated that the traditional two-dimensional circular particle DEM model under-predicts the shoulder, toe and vortex center positions and the power draw by around 10 degrees. The effect of particle shape and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 153, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12491639493439463525", "cites_id": ["12491639493439463525"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751602000650", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZSCzjO83W60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 8, "2005": 1, "2006": 10, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 12, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 14, "2018": 13, "2019": 13, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
