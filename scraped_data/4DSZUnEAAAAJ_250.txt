SPH is particularly well suited to momentum dominated flows, flows involving complex free surface behaviour and flows involving complex physics such as solidification or flow through industrial porous media. The method and its strengths are described. Application to mesoscopic modelling of porous media and several important industrial applications, including gravity die casting, resin transfer moulding and heat and fluid flow in an electric arc furnace are described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5125534554831043262", "cites_id": ["5125534554831043262"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003210931-17/modelling-industrial-fluid-flow-applications-using-sph-paul-cleary-joseph-ha-mark-sawley", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vrqxeIWOIUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
