Most mitigation strategies still rely on a mixture of empirical models and statistical data and so are limited in their ability to quantify the risk in a particular area. However, with the recent advances made in the field of computational mechanics, it has now become possible to develop realistic numerical models of natural disasters. With landslides, a major challenge of the numerical approach is to reliably predict all phases of an event, from its initiation to its propagation including interaction with the surroundings. In this paper, a combination of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Methods (DEM) is considered to address this challenge and to enable the simulation of a complete event. The onset of slope instability is predicted using SPH and a Drucker-Prager yield criterion suitable for pressure dependent materials. The subsequent collapse of the landslide is then simulated by DEM. The failure plane predicted by SPH is used to convert the representation of the mobilised rock or soil mass to a discrete representation. This combined approach is illustrated using an idealised example of slope stability and its potential for simulating complete landslides is demonstrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8653284095828058863", "cites_id": ["8653284095828058863"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent-Lemiale/publication/256444340_Numerical_Modelling_of_Landslide_Events_Using_a_Combination_of_Continuum_and_Discrete_Methods/links/00b7d5229da7a0101d000000/Numerical-Modelling-of-Landslide-Events-Using-a-Combination-of-Continuum-and-Discrete-Methods.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:72JewAmkFngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
