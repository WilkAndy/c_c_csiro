Waves impacting the platform at a range of different angles are investigated for two different mooring systems: a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) system and a Taut Spread Mooring (TSM) system. The heave and surge responses of the platform are significantly different for the two mooring systems. The TSM system undergoes large heave but comparatively smaller surge motion than the TLP system. The degree of pitch is also very similar. The effect of wave impact angle is surprisingly small except for it\u2019s affect on the peak cable tension. The total tension in the leading mooring cable increases by approximately 1.6 times as the wave impact angle increases from 0\u00ba to 45\u00ba, having significant implication for mooring integrity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1127835881395884578", "cites_id": ["1127835881395884578"], "pub_url": "https://onepetro.org/ISOPEIOPEC/proceedings-abstract/ISOPE09/All-ISOPE09/ISOPE-I-09-465/7273", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IpKKM8Lgpg8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
