One of the issues with such castings is the oxide generated especially during the filling of the casting table in the start-up phase. This oxide can affect the performance of the product during subsequent extrusion. While the very first material is cut off and discarded the distribution of oxides along the cast length is not known. It is therefore highly desirable to have an ability to predict the amount and distribution of the oxide generated during the process start-up. In this paper, we use the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method to model the mould filling phase of DC casting. The free surface nature of the flow during this phase is especially amenable to the mesh-free SPH modelling technique. Additionally this method is very suitable for predicting surface driven and history dependent properties such as oxides. The paper presents preliminary predictions of cumulative interior and exterior oxide levels with time in a typical DC casting operation. The amount of interior oxide will indicate the effect of oxide on the final metal microstructure. The amount of exterior oxide determines the surface quality of the billet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14016000179029693515", "cites_id": ["14016000179029693515"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2006/PDFs/055Pra.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S1TgIufVgsIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
