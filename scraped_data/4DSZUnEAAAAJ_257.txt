The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Since the SPH method is mesh free it is well suited to simulating complex free-surface flows of this kind involving wave propagation, splashing, wave refraction and break up. The full three dimensional nature of the simulation allows important features such as the differential breaking of the wave due to variations in the sea bed level, preferential inundation of exposed coastal features and wave reflection and refraction. The paper demonstrates the ability of the SPH method to handle these large geophysical phenomena having length scales of the order of kilometres and to be able to predict information of importance for coastal defence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4351997017057945581", "cites_id": ["4351997017057945581"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu.au/intranet/proceedings/14afmc/14AFMC/PDF/AUTHOR/FM010055.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7WdMqTpmZTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2}}
