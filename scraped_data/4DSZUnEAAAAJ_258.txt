The first known systematic search for sixth\u2010order integrals was performed for cubic and quartic polynomial potentials. It revealed that there exist no nondegenerate cases with such integrals for either potential. Similarly, there exists no nondegenerate fifth or sixth degree polynomial potentials possessing quartic invariants. A complete list of three\u2010dimensional cubic potentials with quadratic integrals is given. All these integrable three\u2010dimensional potentials can be interpreted as orthogonal superpositions of known integrable two\u2010dimensional potentials possessing quadratic integrals. They correspond to 3 of 11 possible coordinate systems in which three\u2010dimensional potentials separate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15053661083039165163", "cites_id": ["15053661083039165163"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.529024", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6-qrT_9Y6dAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
