It is a difficult problem to simulate with standard CFD techniques and in this paper we apply the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique to rogue wave impact on a semi-submersible platform. The simulation results show that the scenario can be successfully simulated, and indicate that the effect of wave impact angle plays a minor role in most of the kinematics of platform motion. More importantly, it is shown that the tension in the mooring cables, and their propensity to break, depends strongly on the wave impact angle. The nature of the mooring system plays a significant role in the kinematics of platform motion and the cable loading, as do the material properties of the cables. SPH is seen to be a useful tool in the design of floating offshore platforms and mooring systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15996358108328645467", "cites_id": ["15996358108328645467"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2009/PDFs/101RUD.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W1PeevJ6_t0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
