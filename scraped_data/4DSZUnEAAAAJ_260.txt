The importance of particle shape is demonstrated through a series of simple examples. Shape controls resistance to shear, the magnitude of collision stress, dilation and the angle of repose. We use a periodic flow of a bed of particles to demonstrate the different states of granular matter, the generation of dilute granular flow when granular temperature is high and the flow dependent nature of the granular thermodynamic boundary conditions. A series of industrial case studies examines how DEM can be used to understand and improve processes such as separation, mixing, grinding, excavation, hopper discharge, metering and conveyor interchange. Finally, an example of landslide motion over real topography is presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14336723819511484712", "cites_id": ["14336723819511484712"], "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812771995_0008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KBHdyFpG9sYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
