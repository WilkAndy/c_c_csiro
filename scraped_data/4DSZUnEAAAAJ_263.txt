Gardner, eds., World Scientific, Singapore", "pages": "148-156", "abstract": "Granular flows are the motion of particulate solids, where the individual grains move independently and the interactions are predominantly collisional. These flows can be driven by gravity, physical or periodic boundaries, interstitial fluids (such as in a slurry), or external body forces such as electro-magnetic fields. Many geophysical and industrial situations involve granular flows. These include landslides, stockpiles, hoppers, silos, conveyor belts, open cut mining, chemical processing of minerals in ro-tary kilns, grinding and crushing processes, blasting and fracturing. The applications are nearly endless.Modelling granular flows involves following the trajectories of all the particles in the system and predicting all their interactions with other particles and the surroundings both efficiently and accurately. The most robust technique involves using a soft parti-cle collision model to evaluate the forces of the collisional interactions and integrating"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7749923771266129656", "cites_id": ["7749923771266129656"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SQhqEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA148&dq=info:-F6s7ptCjWsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=mIGaK9YrIm&sig=l-jMc6UzU78FWWnb-nAe15vSiWQ", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-F6s7ptCjWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 5, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
