Small improvements in performance can produce substantial savings. The design of the bucket and the way in which it fills with overburden are very important to the overall dragline performance. Here we use a numerical model to simulate this filling process and to differentiate between the flow patterns of two different buckets. Extensions to the model are explored."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9388654578255287858", "cites_id": ["9388654578255287858"], "pub_url": "http://miis.maths.ox.ac.uk/460/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MlbAf5gzS4IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
