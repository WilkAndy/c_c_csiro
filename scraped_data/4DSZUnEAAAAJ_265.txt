Eight homogeneous quartic potentials are found in addition to the seven integrable cases given by weak Painlev\u00e9 analysis. They are examined using various numerical techniques and Ziglin\u2019s theorem. Only one of them remains a candidate for integrability, which indicates that, in general, most rational algebraic branch points are incompatible with integrability. Movable logarithmic singularities also appear to be inconsistent with integrability. However, the remaining potentials are either regular or nearly regular for the energies examined, and are therefore still of interest for numerical purposes. The corresponding surfaces of section are found to be particularly simple in structure and belong to a small number of topologically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3717385628998055951", "cites_id": ["3717385628998055951"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.528546", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DziStYjOljMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
