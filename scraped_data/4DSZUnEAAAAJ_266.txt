Algorithms that are able to calculate geometric measures such as the variation of the cross-sectional area available for flow at each height in the crusher, open and closed side areas, geometry based reduction ratios, eccentric throw as well as the open and closed side setting are described. These are demonstrated in a worked example of a specific short head cone crusher showing how systematic variation in the cone vertical displacement and eccentric angle affects geometric measures. Both the OSS and CSS are found to vary almost linearly with cone height and eccentric angle. The eccentric throw is found to be nearly invariant for changes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3300365757716349387", "cites_id": ["3300365757716349387"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687520305215", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y8GLqStBzS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
