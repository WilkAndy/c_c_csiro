Compared to writing research software from scratch, they provide a more accessible way to acquire data, customise inputs and combine algorithms in order to produce research outputs that are reproducible. Today there are a number of SWSs such as Apache Taverna, Galaxy, Kepler, KNIME, Pegasus and CSIRO\u2019s Workspace. Depending on your definition you may also consider environments such as MATLAB or programming languages with dedicated scientific support, such as Python with its SciPy and NumPy libraries, to be SWSs. All address different subsets of requirements, but generally attempt to address at least the following four to varying degrees: 1) improving researcher productivity, 2) providing the ability to create reproducible workflows, 3) enabling collaboration between different research teams, and 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9330805636093642452", "cites_id": ["9330805636093642452"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9330805636093642452&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1AaTD0qufYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
