Such devices use conveyor belts to drag a series of buckets in a circuit, up, around and then down within an enclosure. They are typically used for upward transport of fine granular materials. The speed at which these buckets travel can displace a large volume of air. Interaction between this air and the bucket contents can modify the discharge dynamics of the granular load. A coupled gas-particulate numerical model is presented using Finite Differences to solve for the gas flow with an Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) to represent the complex bucket and enclosure geometry in the model. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used for particulate flow. The combined method is used to investigate the effect of gas flow on particulate behavior, particularly at the time of discharge from the buckets. The bucket elevator design used is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2371796652790951693", "cites_id": ["2371796652790951693"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591016308865", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Da8QSX1Q6iAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
