Such modeling can facilitate better understanding of the first stage of digestion and can directly contribute to the development of new and improved foodstuffs that promote better health outcomes and which are more suited to aging populations. The challenges for such modeling are identified and discussed in detail. The state of the art for oral digestion modeling using coupled biomechanical\u2013particle methods is described. Finally, an example of chewing of a liquid caramel\u2013filled elastic brittle chocolate Easter egg is presented to illustrate the current capabilities of this model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9481630660993998116", "cites_id": ["9481630660993998116"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9481630660993998116&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JN3_r9mElYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
