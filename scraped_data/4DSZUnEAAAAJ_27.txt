It allows for the generation (nucleation) of bubbles from gas dissolved in the fluid, the motion of the discrete bubbles including bubble collisions and drag interactions with the liquid which could be undergoing complex free surface motion, the formation and motion of coupled foams and the final dissipation of bubbles. This allows comprehensive simulations of dynamic bubble behavior. The underlying fluid simulation is based on the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. Each particle representing the liquid contains an amount of dissolved gas. Gas is transferred from the continuum fluid model to the discrete bubble model at nucleation sites on the surface of solid bodies. The rate of gas transport to the nucleation sites controls the rate of bubble generation, producing very natural time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14706319940398232648", "cites_id": ["14706319940398232648"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1275808.1276499", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SDSugBFYF8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 9, "2009": 14, "2010": 14, "2011": 11, "2012": 15, "2013": 13, "2014": 3, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
