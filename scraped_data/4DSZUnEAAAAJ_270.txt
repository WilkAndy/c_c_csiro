Complete experimental measures of stroke technique and the interactions between the water and the paddle and the boat are not practical in the racing environment. Instead, simulation using computational fluid dynamics may be used to study this system. A coupled biomechanical-Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model of the kayaking athlete is presented. Using stroke technique digitised from video of an amateur level athlete and literature data, calculations are made of (a) the fluid response to interactions with the paddle and kayak;(b) six degrees of freedom kayak motion; and (c) magnitudes of blade force and impulse. Key features of the fluid response are related to the loading on the athlete and the speed of the kayak. Perturbations to stroke technique are explored to give new insights into the relationships between technique and racing performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18240022010446888448", "cites_id": ["18240022010446888448"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Harrison-11/publication/235672504_KAYAK_PERFORMANCE_MODELLING_USING_SPH/links/597fb1bda6fdcc1a9acee6d5/KAYAK-PERFORMANCE-MODELLING-USING-SPH.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AD7-82CTIf0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 4}}
