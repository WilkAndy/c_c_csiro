Current computational models can only capture large-scale flow events and are unable to resolve three-dimensional mesoscale local flow features. We present a multiscale coupled fluid method, with large-scale flow over the full domain coupled with a smaller-scale model to more accurately resolve local flow features in regions of interest. The macroscale model uses a finite volume method based on the shallow water (SW) formulation. This is coupled to a mesoscale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for solving the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid flow. We show the viability of this multiscale method for predicting both large-scale and smaller-scale flow effects in geophysical flow applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14346572281127753851", "cites_id": ["14346572281127753851"], "pub_url": "https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/61fd1b191cf7e96f,60d46fd24926cf5e,7b030bc20bde8786.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e9gVcXpDGccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
