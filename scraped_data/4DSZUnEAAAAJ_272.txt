Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) is used to investigate the effects of design, operating and material property factors on the extraction ratio and sample properties and to understand the mechanisms that can lead to sample bias when using a Vezin. This modelling suggests that this type of sampler performs very well giving a very good extraction ratio and negligible sample bias over a wide range of conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4579292247380821793", "cites_id": ["4579292247380821793"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250911001436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IYfVbwnqjD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
