Predicting the outcomes of landslides near settlements would prove useful for hazard mitigation and disaster management. Numerical simulation of landslides allows a wide range of outcomes based on different risks and mitigation strategies to be investigated at relatively low cost. For collision-dominated landslides, modelling using a continuum approach known as the Savage-Hutter method is most common. Another approach to modelling landslides is to use the discrete element method (DEM). This is a meshless numerical method which models the system at the particle level. It allows the prediction of individual collisions of particles with each other and with the surrounding terrain. DEM has previously been applied to landslide modelling using two dimensional discs (Cleary & Campbell 1993, Campbell et al. 1995, Tang et al. 2009, Thompson et al. 2009) and three dimensional spheres (Cleary & Prakash 2004). This approach neglects the important role particle shape plays in the behaviour of granular flow. The use of shaped particles in the form of super-quadrics for landslide modelling was first introduced by Cleary (2009, 2010). The non-sphericity of the particles was shown to have a strong impact on the flow, run-out distance and structure of the final deposit. In this paper, DEM simulations are compared to laboratory-scale experiments of nominally dry sand avalanches across an irregular three dimensional terrain undertaken by Iverson et al (2004). Comparisons between the simulations and experiments are used to better \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13088186976105280122", "cites_id": ["13088186976105280122"], "pub_url": "https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/three-dimensional-avalanche-modelling-across-irregular-terrain-us", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ejKm6LWUorUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
