It has been extensively investigated both experimentally and computationally, and many granular flow theories use hopper discharge as a benchmark for validation. Most simulations neglect the effect of the interstitial gas, as the gas phase is assumed to have little influence on the dynamics of the particles. However, at small length scales drag forces significantly alter flow rates. We investigate these gas flow effects at different hopper size scalings using a coupled Discrete Element Method and pressure-gradient-force Navier Stokes solution method. We show excellent agreement between our results and various hopper flow theories, and demonstrate the strong influence of the gas flow on the discharge rate of the hopper at small length scales. We show that granular dilation occurs which is consistent with the granular free-fall arch theory at the hopper outlet, accompanied by a sharp gas pressure gradient opposing the particle motion. We also find a pre-dilation region prior to the granular arch corresponding to a granular dilatancy point. Our findings enable both an improved understanding of the fluid-gas flow interaction and the evaluation of strategies for specific industrial installations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7789952966191410607", "cites_id": ["7789952966191410607"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf09/PDFs/121HIL.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r-3WJvN4G2wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
