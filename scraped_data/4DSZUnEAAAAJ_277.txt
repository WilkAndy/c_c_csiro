Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a particle\u2010based Lagrangian method that is particularly suited to the analysis of fracture due to its capacity to model large deformation and to track free surfaces generated. A damage model is used to predict the fracture of elastic solids. The damage parameter represents the volume\u2010averaged micro\u2010fracture of the volume of material represented by an SPH particle. Evolution of damage is predicted using the strain history of each particle. Damage inhibits the transmission of tensile stress between particles, and once it reaches unity, the interface becomes unable to transmit tensile stress, resulting in a macro\u2010crack. Connected macro\u2010cracks lead to complete fragmentation. In this paper, we explore the ability of an SPH\u2010based damage model to predict brittle fracture of rocks during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12608005190717631361", "cites_id": ["12608005190717631361"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3155126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gWsBv-uh-K4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
