It is demonstrated for a simple arc welding configuration by using full three-dimensional elastoplastic analysis. The flow pattern of the filler material and the resulting plastic strain distribution are analysed. The effect of welding speed on the plastic deformation in the weld pool is studied. This work establishes the capability of SPH as a tool for gaining insight into the material deposition and plastic deformation in arc welding processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8491493292515483153,11464600112051985179", "cites_id": ["8491493292515483153", "11464600112051985179"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2009/PDFs/124DAS.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EV7_4CjY13UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
