The type of granular flow in such systems is strongly dependent on the imposed gas flow rate, and can be categorised by a distinct set of modes. These modes range from dilute flow, where the grains are entirely suspended in the gas, to moving dunes and slug flow, in which the bore of the pipe is blocked by a slow moving plug of material. Understanding the transitions between these modes is critical to the design and application of pneumatic conveying systems. Particle shape is a crucial factor in systems with gas\u2013grain interactions but has so far been overlooked in models of pneumatic conveying. We carry out a series of simulations using the discrete element method coupled to gas flow and show that particle shape is critical to the transition between different flow modes.
