It builds on our previous studies of deformation of elastic solids under uniaxial and biaxial loading. A laboratory scale triaxial compression test is used to demonstrate the generation, propagation and reflection of the elastic waves in the specimen. To verify the SPH based approach, the results are compared to matching results using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The solutions predicted by SPH are found to agree well. This paper illustrates the potential of SPH for accurate modelling of solid materials that are subjected to triaxial compression, and of the resulting elastic wave propagation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=876982182653337949", "cites_id": ["876982182653337949"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul-Cleary-5/publication/43476723_Modelling_Stress_Wave_Propagation_and_Triaxial_Compression_Test_using_Smoothed_Particle_Hydrodynamics/links/0c96052b09f7e72b39000000/Modelling-Stress-Wave-Propagation-and-Triaxial-Compression-Test-using-Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XSFmD6aqKwwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
