A particle-based modelling approach is presented which comprises Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) representations of continua (liquids and solids), coupled with Discrete Element Model (DEM) representations of discrete components such as solid particulates and bubbles. The simulation framework is demonstrated for six example applications that are common in food manufacturing and that are difficult to model with other numerical approaches. Simulations are presented for liquid mixing in a planetary mixer of fluids of varied viscosity, solid particulate blending in a ribbon blender, particle size reduction of almonds fragmented in a food processor, sieving of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11118983273773466463", "cites_id": ["11118983273773466463"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960308521000249", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XwPHaGCQTpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
