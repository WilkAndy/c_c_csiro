We present recent advances in particle-based modelling of mills for comminution focused around wear and the effect of slurry and slurry phase grinding. Three mill scenarios are considered:1.Media flow and the resulting wear evolution of the belly and end wall liners and the resulting change in mill performance for a full industrial scale dry ball mill (modelled using DEM)2.Axial slurry transport and mixing in a wet overflow industrial scale ball mill (modelled using fully coupled DEM and SPH)3.Effect of mill speed on slurry and solid charge motion and the resulting grinding of fine particles in a 1.8 m diameter wet Hardinge pilot mill (modelled using fully coupled DEM and SPH with advection-diffusion-population balance equations solved for the slurry size \u2026Media flow and the resulting wear evolution of the belly and end wall liners and the resulting change in mill performance for a full industrial scale dry ball mill (modelled using DEM)Axial slurry transport and mixing in a wet overflow industrial scale ball mill (modelled using fully coupled DEM and SPH)Effect of mill speed on slurry and solid charge motion and the resulting grinding of fine particles in a 1.8 m diameter wet Hardinge pilot mill (modelled using fully coupled DEM and SPH with advection-diffusion-population balance equations solved for the slurry size \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14499729555229782539", "cites_id": ["14499729555229782539"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X20303231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CzK0JjVjOckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
