The charge in the mill is strongly sheared and circulates rapidly but has a free surface shape that is constant and which rotates with the mill rotation. The horizontal cross-sectional area of the charge decreases with increasing height. Particles within the mill discharge when the rotating charge flows over and is pushed towards the discharge ports. DEM enables the prediction of transient and steady state mass flow rates from each of the individual discharge ports. Twelve discharge ports at different locations in the mill are used here to explore the optimality of the various size and location options and to explore if there is any interaction in the discharge between adjacent ports. This provides information relevant to the operation of this type of mill, guidance for port selection and provides a general demonstration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10154368678172919234", "cites_id": ["10154368678172919234"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687514002465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:woXZPIOQ64wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1}}
