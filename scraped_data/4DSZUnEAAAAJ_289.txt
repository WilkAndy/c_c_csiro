The exact structural processes occurring during these repeated cycles are challenging to understand due to the complex multiparticle interactions within the material. Using a computational approach, we reduce the loading imposed on the system to the smallest possible component \u2013 a single particle within the bed. This simplified system allows us to isolate the contribution from a single unit of granular material to the overall response of the bed. We use the Discrete Element Method to model a packed, periodic, granular bed responding to the action of a single particle. The particle is drawn through the bed by means of a stiff virtual spring. Multiple stick-slip events in the bed are analysed by tracking of individual force chains and threecycles, enabling a comprehensive characterisation of their birth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17991358383240414454", "cites_id": ["17991358383240414454"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4812063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9oTKkyAlrvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
