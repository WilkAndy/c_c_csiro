The load in such a mill typically contains 250,000\u2013450,000 particles larger than 6mm, allowing correct representation of more than 90% of the charge in Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. Most AG/SAG mills use discharge grate slots which are 15mm or more in width. The mass in each size fraction usually decreases rapidly below grate size. This scale of DEM model is now within the possible range of standard workstations running an efficient DEM code. This paper describes various ways of extracting collision data from the DEM model and translating it into breakage estimates. Account is taken of the different breakage mechanisms (impact and abrasion) and of the specific impact histories of the particles in order to assess the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7936899605138153418", "cites_id": ["7936899605138153418"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687504001815", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yp8yriOIJW4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 11, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 15, "2016": 8, "2017": 16, "2018": 10, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 6}}
