CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia", "pages": "1-6", "abstract": "Aluminium melt transfer operations can lead to significant amounts of dross formation. A significant proportion of this metal loss may be prevented by adopting more efficient melt transfer strategies that reduce splashing and turbulence thereby resulting in reduced oxide and therefore dross formation. Optimisation of such systems can be achieved rapidly by employing computational modelling to explore the effects of changed conditions such as crucible tilt speed, spout height and spout geometry. From a modelling perspective, accurately predicting the amount of oxide produced during melt transfer operations is difficult due to the inability of existing mesh-based flow modelling techniques to carry history information such as mass of oxide formed on a per node basis. Difficulty also arises due to the lack of validated oxidation models useful for such flow regimes. The grid-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been used to predict the amount of oxide generated during a molten metal transfer process, where the metal is poured into a sow from a tilting crucible furnace. The Lagrangian framework allows tracking of history-dependent properties such as accumulated oxide mass. An oxidation model based on skimming trials performed at the laboratory scale is used. Favourable comparisons with experimentally measured oxide levels are obtained for metal transfer rates from 0.8\u20135.2 kg/s."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9170993057909345303", "cites_id": ["9170993057909345303"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf09/PDFs/123PRA.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F4xCnpjpRX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
