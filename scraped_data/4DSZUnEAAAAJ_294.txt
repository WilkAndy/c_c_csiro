Quantitative comparison of the charge distributions, the shoulder and toe positions between the experiments and the different DEM models employed allows the effect of different modelling assumptions to be evaluated. Comparisons are made for a given fill level and three mill speeds for three different liner profiles. These comparisons demonstrate that traditional two-dimensional DEM simulations using circular particles under-predict shoulder and toe positions by around 10 and show that particle shape makes an important contribution to the shape of the charge profile. Importantly they demonstrate that full three-dimensional modelling is able to quantitatively capture the real dynamics found in the experimental mill."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1651633801371882438", "cites_id": ["1651633801371882438"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Morrell3/publication/43462056_DEM_validation_for_a_scale_model_SAG_mill/links/56bc24a608ae3f9793155951/DEM-validation-for-a-scale-model-SAG-mill.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xpPMDTHI6xYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
