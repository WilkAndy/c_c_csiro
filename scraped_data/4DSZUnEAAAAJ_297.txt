Conversely, chaotic orbits are always found between quasiperiodic orbit families that cannot be smoothly deformed from one to another. A group of preferred unstable periodic orbits determines the effects of perturbations on the surfaces of section of integrable potentials. They change in two very specific ways, generating either a chaotic region about a hyperbolic point or a new family of invariant curves about one of the preferred unstable periodic orbits."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17299530531662756784", "cites_id": ["17299530531662756784"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.41.2924", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sHvImFxHFPAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
