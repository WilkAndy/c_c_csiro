It is designed to assist coaches, athletes and sports biomechanists in understanding, visualising and improving diving performance for both platform and springboard diving. This application was developed by research scientists within CSIRO Data61 and was built upon the Workspace workflow engine. Biomechanics algorithms were developed within this graphical workflow environment and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to make the software accessible to end users. Workspace also simplified the packaging of Dive Mechanic by providing an installer and access to software licensing controls. This paper outlines how the Workspace workflow engine assisted in the process of both developing scientific algorithms and encapsulating them within a commercial product offering.Dive Mechanic was developed by CSIRO for use by Diving Australia as part of a larger project to investigate diving technique and injury risk. The aerial dynamics portion of the modelling was identified as sufficiently computationally-cheap to facilitate an interactive software solution. Dive Mechanic uses personalised body and motion data based on laser scans of the athletes and markerless motion digitisation from multiple camera video of the athletes performing dives. It employs a fast and detailed human biomechanics motion engine specifically developed for the application that allows diver technique to be modified interactively by coaches in order to explore technique or synchronisation improvements. Its GUI is powerful yet sufficiently simple and intuitive so as to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1008541259399628490", "cites_id": ["1008541259399628490"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1008541259399628490&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ygbXk-4O_w0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
