Traditional viral inactivation methods are effective for the removal and inactivation of enveloped viruses, but less effective against small nonenveloped viruses. UV\u2010C irradiation has been demonstrated to be an effective means of inactivating such viruses. The UVivatec lab system consists of a spiral tube around an UV\u2010C irradiation source. Flow of a solution through the chamber generates and ensures controlled mixing and uniform exposure to irradiation. A detailed assessment of the effect of flow rate, alternate cross sectional design and scale up of the irradiation chamber on Dean vortices was performed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. The aim was to provide a basis for setting flow rate limits and using a laboratory scale apparatus to model viral inactivation in larger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3251876386753675435", "cites_id": ["3251876386753675435"], "pub_url": "https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/btpr.1676", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qwDvNVj8IC0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3}}
