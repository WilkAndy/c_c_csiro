The flow structure consists of an active basal shear zone supporting the majority of the landslide, which travels as a relatively solid plug. The observed runout appears to depend on the total energy dissipation which is a trade\u2010off between (1) the inelasticity of the particles, which governs the energy dissipated in each event, and, (2), the size of the dissipating shear zone, which governs the number of particles that are actively dissipating energy. Very inelastic particles quickly dissipate the work performed at boundaries and result in thin dissipative zones. As a result, these two factors balance and the runout is nearly independent of particle inelasticity. Along the same lines, increasing the boundary roughness was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17886114365926833187", "cites_id": ["17886114365926833187"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/93JB02380", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I3wUSUA-OPgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 2, "2006": 9, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 3, "2011": 8, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
