The amount of oxide produced is a function of several factors including the rate at which the crucible is tilted, the height of the crucible in relation to the furnace position and the location of the pivot of rotation. In this paper we evaluate the effect of crucible tilting rate on oxide formation for an industrial scale crucible and furnace setup. The mesh free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used for modelling the metal flow and oxide prediction. The model predicts rapid oxidation rates during periods of energetic fluid motion on freshly exposed metal surface and lower oxidation rates as oxide thickness increases. Four crucible rotation rates typical of normal operating conditions in a smelter are evaluated. The simulations showed that oxide generated due to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1139744661522811650", "cites_id": ["1139744661522811650"], "pub_url": "https://www.scientific.net/MSF.693.54", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Agu3JLsv0Q8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
