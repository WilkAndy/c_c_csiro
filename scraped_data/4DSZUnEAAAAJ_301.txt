It is demonstrated for a simple arc welding configuration by solving the fully coupled three-dimensional elastoplastic and heat transfer analysis. The temperature distribution of the metal in the weld pool and the surrounding parent material are analysed using SPH, and the resulting residual thermal stresses are evaluated. This work establishes the capability of SPH as a tool for simulating the long-term thermo-mechanical responses, including heat transfer and residual stresses in a welded joint, and gaining insights into post-welding structural behaviour of joints during cooling stages."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3873229434200106669", "cites_id": ["3873229434200106669"], "pub_url": "https://www.scientific.net/MSF.654-656.2751", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:raYVL6Z5wDUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
