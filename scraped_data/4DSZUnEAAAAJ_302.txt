In the neck of the Femur about 70% of the strength is contributed by the cortical bone, which is the most highly stressed part of the structure and is the site where catastrophic failure is almost certainly initiated. A deeper understanding of age-related changes at this anatomical site is essential if an understanding of the mechanisms by which hips weaken and become vulnerable to fracture is to be gained. The aim of this study was to (i) examine a hypothesis that low strain low fields arise due to age related pore distributions causing bone absorption, and (ii) use a meshless Lagrangian particle-based computational modeling approach Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics\u2019 (SPH) to capture bone remodeling features at the particle level. The key findings from this study were firstly that bone \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6665502764903592829", "cites_id": ["6665502764903592829"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-14515-5_199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fXN2B3OfgFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
