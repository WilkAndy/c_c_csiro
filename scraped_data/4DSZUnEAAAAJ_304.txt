Simulation branching is effected by making a record of the system state of a first simulation as it exists at a point in time. If the director wishes to change the manner in which the simulated event progresses, a second simulation can be executed using the recorded system state as input conditions for a second simulation. This allows rapid re-execution of a portion of a simulation without requiring lengthy re-simulation of the initial portion of the simulated event which is already thought to be satisfactory. Such branching can also be used to control high resolution of a focus region being a smaller portion of a wider simulated event."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13957852987161973617", "cites_id": ["13957852987161973617"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090259450A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cRPqBldBtMEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
