The motion of particulates and the deformation of solids are dominated by the contact forces between bodies. The prediction of these forces and the subsequent evolution of the particulate system is the basis of the DEM methods. DEM is increasingly coupled to other important physics such as fluid motion, material deformation, and fracture."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12600309278330296478", "cites_id": ["12600309278330296478"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/3eaea6ee158cefc634973b41d64b2c83/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=32565", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:npjvgodK3a4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
