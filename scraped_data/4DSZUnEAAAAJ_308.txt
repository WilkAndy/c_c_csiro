A Lagrangian simulation technique that is particularly well suited to modelling HPDC is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Materials are approximated by particles that are free to move around rather than by fixed grids, enabling the accurate prediction of fluid flows involving complex free surface motion. Four examples of SPH simulated HPDC flows are presented, ranging from zinc casting of a door lock plate to aluminium casting of a full engine rocker cover. These show unprecedented detail in the fluid free surfaces, particularly in the extent of fragmentation and void formation. SPH has other attractive features for the prediction of casting, including easy prediction of shrinkage, feeding, some forms of porosity generation and surface oxide formation. Flow predictions coupled to heat transfer and solidification are validated using short shots. The bulk features of the final solid castings are in good agreement with the predictions. These results combine to demonstrate that SPH modelling of HPDC has now reached a level where both isothermal and thermal simulations can be performed in reasonable computation times for large scale automotive castings and provide a good degree of predictive accuracy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13031478154809821652", "cites_id": ["13031478154809821652"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph-Ha/publication/291145862_Simulation_of_casting_complex_shaped_objects_using_SPH/links/5a4ca980458515a6bc6cfb19/Simulation-of-casting-complex-shaped-objects-using-SPH.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1Mmzi1Yc2bQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
