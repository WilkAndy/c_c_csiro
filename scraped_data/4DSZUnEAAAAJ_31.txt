This technology is still poorly understood when used in the mineral processing context. This makes process optimisation of such devices problematic. 3D DEM simulations of the flow of grinding media in pilot scale tower mills and pin mills are carried out in order to investigate the relative performance of these stirred mills. Media flow patterns and energy absorption rates and distributions are analysed here. In the second part of this paper, coherent flow structures, equipment wear and mixing and transport efficiency are analysed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3475185390351927942", "cites_id": ["3475185390351927942"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687506002068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hsqNQLNWOjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 14, "2020": 16, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
