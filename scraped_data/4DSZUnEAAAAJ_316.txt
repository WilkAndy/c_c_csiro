For modelling these, inclusion of both the elastoplastic material response and history-dependent collisional forces is essential. The Collisional-SPH method, originally developed for elastic collisions, incorporates frictional collision forces into SPH and accounts for their history-dependence. In this paper, CSPH is extended to model elastoplastic collisions by incorporating an elastoplastic material model. A thorough validation of this elastoplastic CSPH method is presented. CSPH is then used to analyse the influence of deformation on history-dependent collision forces. It is found that the elastoplastic deformation and the resulting shape change of the substrate alter the contact-zone mechanics by influencing the local tangential force distribution. These effects become more pronounced with increasing deformation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15387089669013366682", "cites_id": ["15387089669013366682"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301679X22000111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:muefmIfsidUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
