Systematically investigating all possible parameters that could potentially influence the extent of a landslide is costly and generally not practical. In this paper, a methodology to numerically assess the impact of potential landslides is proposed. In this approach the landslide simulations were carried out using finite element model estimates of potential failure volume as an input into a discrete element model which is used to assess run-out and consequences. A statistical design of experiments was implemented to determine the most important factors influencing the landslide extent thereby significantly reducing the number of simulations required. The method is illustrated on a case study of potential failure of an overburden dump at a coal mine.
