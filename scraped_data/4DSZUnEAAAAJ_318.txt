Stirring was achieved by a cylinder executing a two-dimensional periodic Lissajoux figure. The rate and direction of stirring by the cylinder was varied. The particle motions were analysed using a tracking method developed for the experimental design. The Reynolds number associated with the large-scale stirring motion was in a turbulent range of [5,693\u201311,649] across all experiments. The absence of stirring in the direction of the cylinder axis, the constant interference of the cylinder with the eddies and the presence of walls and the free-surface resulted in a flow that was both inhomogeneous and anisotropic as recorded by the particle motion. Despite these unusual conditions, the single-particle dispersion across \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Xz60mAmATU4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5231316589670381006", "cites_id": ["5231316589670381006"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0997754619303267", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zjXpurhemUgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
