The search method further includes:(a) performing a search of cells in a first of the grid levels to determine pairs of entities which satisfy predetermined criteria to be included in a neighbor list for which both entities belong to the first grid level;(b) mapping each nonempty cell in the first grid level to each of the other grid levels, determining neighboring cells in each of the other grid levels and determining all pairs of entities belonging to a pair of levels that satisfy the predetermined criteria for inclusion in the neighbor list; and (c) repeating (a) and (b) for all grid levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17559058196359372273", "cites_id": ["17559058196359372273"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US9633142B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8V1p0GVOrvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
