They are high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling using non-spherical particles has previously provided significant insight into the operation of these dry industrial screens. Here we introduce the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of slurry (water and fine material) through a double deck banana screen. This paper firstly reports on the underlying DEM model of the coarse particulate flow on a full-scale banana screen. We then use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the transport of fine particle slurry over and through the double deck banana screen. Finally, we combine the DEM with SPH models using a one-way coupling to simulate the effects of adding a slurry flow to coarse particulates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15855559172333910549", "cites_id": ["15855559172333910549"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687511000227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FTomlg9DCtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 12, "2016": 8, "2017": 17, "2018": 15, "2019": 12, "2020": 13, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
