A thorough characterisation of their mechanical properties is therefore essential for predictive modelling of their activation processes. Generally these properties are derived from a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations but fault systems are notoriously difficult to model by conventional grid based techniques. This is in part due to the complex nature of rock deformation mechanisms involving large inelastic deformations, damage and fracture processes leading to micro-and macro-cracks interacting at different length scales. Meshless approaches have been increasingly used in the last two decades to handle such problems and move beyond the traditional finite element type models. Among those, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been shown to be particularly effective in modelling large inelastic strains in solids and is therefore of potential great interest for problems in geomechanics as has been discussed in recent applications of SPH to soil and rock materials. In this paper we present an SPH model of a direct shear test as a new case study. This laboratory test is commonly used in geomechanics to derive the strength properties of soils and rocks. However it is usually not possible to simulate more than a few percent of shear deformation using finite elements due to the severe distortion of the mesh. In this work we demonstrate that SPH can reproduce the entire loading path through one to one comparison between simulations and experiments. It is shown that this type of modelling provides valuable information not only \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16343247691485997424", "cites_id": ["16343247691485997424"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ausama-Giwelli/publication/310121864_Numerical_simulations_of_the_direct_shear_test_using_Smoothed_Particle_Hydrodynamics/links/5829205308aecfd7b8c43278/Numerical-simulations-of-the-direct-shear-test-using-Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cOk-Zy_hzuIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
