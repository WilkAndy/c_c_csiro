However given our inability to directly view the relationships between contraction and flow, our understanding of the relationships remains poor. Our aim was to develop a computational flow model that enables prediction of the effect of muscle contraction on fluid transport. Methods: Utilising Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the 3-D colon model consisted of a 5 cm diameter, 30 cm long pipe with periodic boundary conditions at each end. The fecal contents were modelled as a viscous Newtonian fluid with density of 1000 g/cm3 and dynamic viscosity of 1 Pa s. The flexible colon walls were represented by a mesh network of SPH particles connected together by one-dimensional visco-elastic bonds to form the wall. Contractions are then applied by shortening or extending the spring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14122880265404548102", "cites_id": ["14122880265404548102"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP106727&sb=RECENT&n=5&rpp=25&page=135&tr=5060&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BgTQcMaM_sMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
