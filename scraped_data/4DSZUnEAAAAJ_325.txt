For the prediction of fluid events such as dam breaks we use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method, which is very well suited to the resulting complex highly three dimensional free surfaces flows, involving splashing, fragmentation, and interaction with complex topography and engineering structures. The prediction of landsides, which are collisional flows of rocks, is performed using the Discrete Element Method. Two case studies of dam breaks and one landslide event demonstrate the level of prediction that is now possible using these simulation methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3729777865922311530", "cites_id": ["3729777865922311530"], "pub_url": "https://www.isprs.org/proceedings/xxxviii/7-c4/13_gsem2009.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:avVpNTXVwjMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
