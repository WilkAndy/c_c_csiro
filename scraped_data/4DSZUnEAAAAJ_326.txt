The process is used with both hot and cold metal and also plastics. Extrusion modelling can be used to reduce trial extrusion numbers because of better process design following from accurate defect prediction. Such models can also be used as input for die-design activities and to indicate ways for improving nonperforming dies.Traditionally, the extrusion process has been modelled using mesh based Finite Element Methods (FEM). However, the large plastic deformations occurring in the billets during extrusion can often lead to heavy remeshing requirements for such methods and excessive numerical diffusion. Here we demonstrate the use of the mesh-less Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for simulating such processes. Its grid-free nature allows SPH to handle large deformations without the need for any re-meshing. Additionally SPH provides the ability to track history dependent properties such as plastic strain on a particle by particle basis making it very suitable for analysis and defect prediction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11331870515449636740", "cites_id": ["11331870515449636740"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2006/PDFs/033Pra.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hCcZ6jHkQp0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
