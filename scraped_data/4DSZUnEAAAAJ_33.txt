They consist of one or more curved decks that are fitted with screen panels with arrays of square or rectangular holes. The screen structure is vibrated while a dense stream of particles flows over it and is separated according to size. The material discharging from the top of the deck is the oversize and may become a coarse product or be crushed and recycled to the screen feed. The material falling through the deck can be further separated by additional decks below. Each lower deck returns a product stream and the material passing out through the bottom deck is the undersize. In this paper, Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to explore the separation performance of a full industrial scale double deck banana screen for a peak acceleration of 5g. The separation efficiency of each deck is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1099129459199483634", "cites_id": ["1099129459199483634"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687509001563", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8p7AcWvkQA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 11, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 20, "2018": 12, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
