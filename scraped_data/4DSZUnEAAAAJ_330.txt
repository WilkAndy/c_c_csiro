For this, the rebound behavior of an ellipsoidal granule impacting an elastic substrate is analyzed for different impact angles and for different initial orientations of the granule. The friction modeling capabilities of SPH are investigated by comparing the rebound spin predicted by the SPH simulations (a) without any special friction model and (b) using Coulomb\u2019s friction model, with DEM results. This study presents the potential of using SPH in analysing granular flow applications and brings to light the limitations associated with the existing friction modeling capabilities in SPH."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:zdjWy_NXXwUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10075701883164922175", "cites_id": ["10075701883164922175"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-9893-7_50", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P5HHuHoV1IsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
