It is designed to assist coaches, athletes and sports biomechanists in understanding, visualising and improving diving technique for the aerial phase of both platform and springboard diving. This application was built upon the Workspace workflow engine which enabled modular design and agile development. Biomechanics algorithms were developed within this graphical workflow environment and an intuitive graphical user interface was developed to make the software accessible to end users. Using Workspace also simplified the packaging of Dive Mechanic by providing an installer and access to software licensing controls. This paper outlines how the Workspace workflow engine assisted in the process of both developing scientific algorithms and encapsulating them within a commercial product offering.
