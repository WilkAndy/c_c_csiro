Progressive damage to this equipment over time can significantly alter the nature of the interaction between the particulates and the equipment surfaces. This can lead to changes in material transport resulting in reduced or unpredictable process efficiencies, as well as potential safety issues in the case of equipment failure. The ability to predict the lifespan of a piece of equipment and progressive changes to processing during this lifespan is important for many industries including mining, manufacturing, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. This study introduces a numerical model for particulate wearing of a mixer blade in a batch mixing application. We simulate the particulate flow in a cylindrical mixer using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and collect locally averaged estimates of shear energy absorption on the surface of the rectangular blade. This is used with a mesh modification algorithm to evolve the surface of the mixer blade forward in time. A series of flow simulations and incremental surface modification are used to predict the progressive shape change of the blade."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3284738624598588332", "cites_id": ["3284738624598588332"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf15/PDFs/122CUM.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rDs0M2C8lS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
