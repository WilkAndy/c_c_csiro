Mechanical and chemical breakdown of food takes place throughout the intestines. Periodic muscular contraction and relaxation of the intestinal walls agitate, mix and propel the multiphase digesta along the intestines. Experimental measurement of flow inside the intestines is difficult therefore understanding of food transport through the majority of the gut is limited. Computational models for predicting the transient behaviour of intestinal content subject to peristaltic activity offer the possibility for assessing the digestive performance of different foods. We present a numerical model of multiphase flow through the duodenum. This consists of a flexible thin membrane representing the gut wall coupled to the particle-based methods Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) which are used to predict the motion of liquid and solids content respectively. The gut wall is viscoelastic and the digesta consists of solid particulates suspended in a viscous Newtonian fluid. Peristaltic waves travel along the gut wall resulting in active muscular contractions and relaxations of the gut. The influence of wall motions on transport of the liquid and solid phases is reported, as well as axial mixing of the solids. The bulk motion of the content shows both phases move together due to the laminar nature of the flow with only very short-term differences found in the relaxation region and in the wake of the contraction. The inclusion of solids mildly modifies the overall propulsive flow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13042160495636072677", "cites_id": ["13042160495636072677"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Harrison-11/publication/292984179_Multiphase_transport_in_the_small_intestine/links/56b3d7c608ae5deb2657e521/Multiphase-transport-in-the-small-intestine.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5UgF1t4P_7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
