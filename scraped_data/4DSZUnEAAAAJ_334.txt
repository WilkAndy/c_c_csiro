The rate of successful adoption by commercial and industrial enterprises, however, does not match the scale of the opportunities. Based on our experience in developing and implementing simulation and optimization solutions, we discuss the opportunities and impediments as they apply to the engineering services and logistics sectors. We then offer insight into how cloud computing concepts and technologies will increase the accessibility and adoptability of simulation and optimization tools, enabling services business to evolve at a faster pace."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3223401809124614742", "cites_id": ["3223401809124614742"], "pub_url": "http://www.aasmr.org/jsms/Vol1/No%205/JSMS_Vol1_No5_1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VmI5-d3SuywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
