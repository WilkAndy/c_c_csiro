It concentrated on DEM modelling of skew cutters. These are set at an angle to the belt with the intention of minimizing disturbance to the non-sampled material."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14256852602681576457", "cites_id": ["14256852602681576457"], "pub_url": "http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532010000600010&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CUzw9eeD2sUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
