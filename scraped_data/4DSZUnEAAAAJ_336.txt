It provides detailed information on bias and size dependent extraction ratios based on closely matched reference and actual samples taken from the same simulations. It has allowed the identification of additional operational and design parameters which influence sample cutter performance. To date, this has been performed for cohesionless bulk materials. Wet bulk materials typically become sticky and this strongly influences their flow behaviour and particularly the mobility of fine particles and the overall flowability of the material. The interaction of the degree of cohesiveness of the material with the size of the cutter is investigated. The effect of cohesion on the mechanisms that lead to sample bias in falling-stream cutters is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4536587347279085974", "cites_id": ["4536587347279085974"], "pub_url": "http://saimm.org.za/Conferences/SamplingBlending2009/129-136_Cleary.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lgEaDygy9T4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
