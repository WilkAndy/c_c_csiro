Discrete element modelling (DEM) is used to investigate the effects of several factors on extraction ratio and sample bias and to understand the mechanisms that can lead to sample bias on sampling using a Vezin. This modelling suggests that they have a good extraction ratio and negligible sample bias over a wide range of operating conditions. Having investigated other possible bias mechanisms, we conjecture that the bias observed by Pitard could be due to the effects of air motion generated by the Vezin rotation on very fine particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13634737640229539764", "cites_id": ["13634737640229539764"], "pub_url": "http://saimm.org.za/Conferences/SamplingBlending2009/219-230-Cleary.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tI-H06RROL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
