We don\u2019t think so and our understanding of bias mechanisms based on discrete element modelling (DEM) simulation is used to support this opinion. We recommend that the designers of sample cutters should estimate the amount of sample bias which would occur for a variety of designs and make decisions considering the economic trade off between the amount of bias and the cost of sampling. One practical implication of this approach is likely to be that economically important falling-stream sample cutters should use apertures greater than 3D."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16990619047726911877", "cites_id": ["16990619047726911877"], "pub_url": "https://www.saimm.co.za/Conferences/SamplingBlending2009/197-202_Ribinson.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hZG_9QDOyusJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
