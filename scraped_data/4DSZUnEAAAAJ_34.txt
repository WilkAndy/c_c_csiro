Many of the processes used for fracturing materials in these industries have the requirement to produce specified size and/or shape of the products. Numerical modelling can assist in understanding and predicting complex fracture processes, and can be used in designing the equipment and setting the process parameters to ensure desired product quality. In this paper, a mesh-free numerical method, called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), is extended to predict impact fracture of rocks. SPH is a particle based Lagrangian method which is particularly suited to the analysis of fracture due to its capacity to model large deformation and track the free surfaces generated. A continuum damage model is used to predict the fracture of rocks. Evolution of damage is predicted using the strain history of each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10050749997574328087", "cites_id": ["10050749997574328087"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167844209001219", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fw-tI99ve4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 14, "2016": 22, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
