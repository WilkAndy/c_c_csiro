To verify the SPH solutions, the same problem is analysed using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The solutions predicted by SPH are found to agree well with those obtained using FEM. The problem is analysed with a number of different particle resolutions. The SPH method is found to have good convergence characteristics. This paper thus demonstrates the potential of SPH for accurate modelling of elastic wave propagation in solid materials."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1787569448551340415", "cites_id": ["1787569448551340415"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1787569448551340415&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f1k-SPG4zhgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
