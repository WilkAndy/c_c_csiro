Computations invariably fail after some level of distortion is reached unless suitable re-meshing is implemented to cope with the mesh distortion arising from the material deformation. The issue of mesh distortion and the subsequent re-meshing are topics of much research for grid based methods. These problems can be overcome by using meshless numerical methods. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is used to model large scale deformation in metal forging in a number of representative work pieces. The test problems demonstrate the ability of SPH to model elastic-plastic solid mechanics problems. SPH also offers advantages in direct prediction of defects because of its ability to advect the material history with the particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5778472945708156033", "cites_id": ["5778472945708156033"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf06/PDFs/080Ha.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gcQjSYdCMVAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
