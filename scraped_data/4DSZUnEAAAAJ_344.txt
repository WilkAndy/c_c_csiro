Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) drop-weight tester characteristics have been shown to be suitable for the prediction of single-event breakage in impact and conventional crushers. However, the prediction of particle breakage in a tumbling mill environment is a continuing challenge because it seems very likely that breakage occurs as a result of several mechanisms and often involves multiple events. A range of small, well-instrumented mills have been developed at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. These mills allow the rate of generation of fine material to be measured in close to real time for autogenous grinding (AG) and semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mill charges. This paper reports on the application of discrete element modeling techniques to the power draw and charge motion within a 1.2-m diameter x 300-mm long pilot-scale mill. Data from a series of experiments were analysed, in which rocks ranging in size from 70 to 150 mm were tumbled at different charge levels. An earlier regression model for the rate of attrition of the rocks is compared with a DEM-based model, which relates the attrition rate to the rock-on-rock impacts. The DEM outputs are also used to predict charge motion within the pilot mill. The DEM-model predictions support the idea of an approximately constant wear rate for 20-180-mm particles for any particular load configuration after the initial particle rounding process is completed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13661865078785593431", "cites_id": ["13661865078785593431"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UY7fqVhR41oC&oi=fnd&pg=PA269&dq=info:V1BUzuexmL0J:scholar.google.com&ots=mYbwM5XLjV&sig=t2FEKjdB1z83btKKEx-b53-5_HE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V1BUzuexmL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
