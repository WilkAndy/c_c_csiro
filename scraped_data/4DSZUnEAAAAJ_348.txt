This is a common in cavities with large aspect ratios. This paper reports the results of a numerical study of the transition from a single cell flow (at low Gr) to multicellular flow (at higher Gr) for a long vertical differentially heated cavity filled with air, for an aspect ratio of 20. This problem has previously been studied previously by Lee and Korpela (1983). In general, our higher resolution simulations are in agreement. Important differences exist in the numbers of cells at the upper and lower end of the range of transition Gr and the value of Gr-."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3160119430379272504", "cites_id": ["3160119430379272504"], "pub_url": "https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/imarusic/proceedings/12/Cleary.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OPmQ_-D_2isJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1}}
