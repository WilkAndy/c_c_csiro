Key to understanding healthy function of these structures is the knowledge of how solid, liquid and gas content move through and mix inside them and how their biomechanical behaviour controls such transport and transformation. Being inside the body, but outside the epithelial layers, these two systems are difficult to characterise experimentally, except when highly invasive procedures are used. Computational modelling can provide insights where experimentation is not practical. Here we use a combination of particle-based models of fluids, solids and particulates, biomechanical models of tract structures and deformations, and biological modelling to investigate function and behaviour of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Example applications include ingestion and oral processing of a chocolate food; liquid-particulate flow in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:unp9ATQDT5gC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5056320252580427407", "cites_id": ["5056320252580427407"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128239131000208", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
