Traditionally, scaled down physical models have been used for validation and to collect hydraulic data. However the ability to efficiently evaluate a range of different spillway designs using physical models is limited by time, cost and resources. Modelling techniques using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are able to quickly evaluate different spillway designs. CFD has therefore played an increasing role in spillway modelling, with physical models used more often to supplement and validate simulations. In this work we use the CFD technique of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to model weir flow through a four bay, radial gated, submerged spillway system. Advantages of SPH for such modelling include automatic representation of free surface flow behaviour due to the Lagrangian nature of the method, the ability to incorporate complex three dimensional geometries involving complicated spillway operations and the ability to include dynamic obstructions in the flow such as debris. To validate the SPH model, the reservoir water depth predicted in the simulations is compared with a physical model. The effect of SPH resolution on the predicted water depth is evaluated. A range of discharge rates are simulated, with the difference in simulated and experimental water depths found to range from 0.016 to 11.48%."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5794902550575679920", "cites_id": ["5794902550575679920"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf12/PDFs/149SAU.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sIkRwyqha1AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
