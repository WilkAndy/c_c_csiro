International Journal of Multiphase Flow", "volume": "37", "number": "2", "pages": "198-214", "abstract": "The level set method provides a natural framework for modelling multiphase phenomena in a Eulerian basis. The method is based on the evolution of the signed distance function from interfaces between phases of the flow, and automatically captures complex topological changes of the free surfaces such as breaking and merging. We present an extension to the level set method for modelling the interaction between fluids and elastic solids, where the level set defines the boundary between fluid and solid. The multiphase method varies the underlying stress tensor depending on the sign of the level set, changing smoothly from a rate of strain dependency within the liquid to a hypo-elastic strain dependency within the solid. We apply the model to two test problems, showing the potential of the model for industrial applications involving the coupled interaction of deformable elastic solids and fluids."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:uDGL6kOW6j0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4935848924891805752", "cites_id": ["4935848924891805752"], "pub_url": "https://www.flair.monash.edu.au/intranet/proceedings/cfd2012/CFD2012/PDFs/140HIL.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OHgrKXKof0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
