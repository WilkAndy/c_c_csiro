It has recently been demonstrated that the rotary classifier is a suitable device for separating out binary granular mixtures, ie mixtures composed of only two different particle types. However, most practical granular mixtures are composed of multicomponent particle types. We therefore study, using the DEM method, the capability of the rotary classifier to segregate mixtures where the particles differ either in size or density. We find that segregation is more significant for size varying systems than for density varying systems. We relate this observation to the underlying physical mechanisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8826404734854040221", "cites_id": ["8826404734854040221"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2012/CFD2012/PDFs/117PER.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nQrNkFewfXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
