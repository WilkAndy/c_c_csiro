Banana screens are high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. While popular, their optimisation provides many challenges because the lower decks are difficult to access for measurement or sampling. Furthermore, these screens have many adjustable parameters and are much less understood than conventional flat vibrating screens. DEM modelling using nonspherical particles has provided significant insight into the operation of dry industrial screens. Here we introduce the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of slurry (water and fine material) through a double deck banana screen. This paper firstly reports on a DEM model of a full-scale banana screen. The mass flows through the grates are highlighted. Secondly, the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow through a double deck banana screen is introduced. The method is ideally suited for the high speeds and the high fragmented and filamentary nature of the fluid flow through the screen deck openings. The non-mass diffusive nature of SPH allows slurry to be realistically tracked through the system. Following this, we model a one-way coupled DEM\u2013SPH simulation to allow the effect of particles to be added to the fluid simulation. SPH can be used for modelling fluid in the slurry and DEM for the particle charge. The effect of different viscosities will be assessed in the coupled cases on the nature of the SPH simulation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3894964780604155189", "cites_id": ["3894964780604155189"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matt-Sinnott/publication/311738159_Using_DEM_and_SPH_to_model_wet_Industrial_Banana_Screen_Using_DEM_and_SPH_to_model_wet_Industrial_Banana_Screens/links/5858b9fd08aeffd7c4fbba86/Using-DEM-and-SPH-to-model-wet-Industrial-Banana-Screen-Using-DEM-and-SPH-to-model-wet-Industrial-Banana-Screens.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NWWR4NSxDTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
