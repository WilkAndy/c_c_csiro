The DEM (Discrete Element Method) particle breakage model is generalised to allow non-round particles to be broken into non-round progeny. Particles are broken in this DEM model when the elastic energy of a contact is sufficiently high to initiate fracture. Progeny size distribution data from JKMRC Drop Weight Test (JKDWT) or JKMRC rotary breakage test (JKRBT) is used to generate the specific daughter fragments from each breakage event. This DEM model is able to predict the production of both coarser progeny which are resolved in the DEM model and finer progeny which are not. This allows the prediction of product down to very small sizes, limited only by the fineness of the fragments measured in the breakage characterisation.
