While often perceived as a benign, easily treated condition, a number of studies confirm a significant adverse impact on health-related quality of life which correlates with severity of constipation. Available evidence implicates abnormal colonic contractility in severe constipation. However, measurement of human colonic motility poses substantial methodological challenges.Understanding the mechanisms that drive motility in the colon relies on understanding the fluid-structure interactions between intestinal walls and the colonic contents. Sequences of peristaltic muscular contractions in the intestinal walls work to transport and mix the fluid contents. Unfortunately, the colon is relatively inaccessible which makes flow measurements of the internal fluid contents difficult.An alternative is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4049981233814242277", "cites_id": ["4049981233814242277"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-14515-5_257", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5QN_dHlsNDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
