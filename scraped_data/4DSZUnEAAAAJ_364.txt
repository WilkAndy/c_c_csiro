SPH is used to predict the effect on mixing performance of varying the density ratio between the liquids. To facilitate mixing, the shaker contains an air gap which provides headspace in which blending occurs. The liquids occupy 50% of the volume of the shaker. Mixing between the two liquids occurs due to interface stretching and folding caused by their periodic rise and fall, forming plume like protrusions at the free surface. The efficiency of the mixing process is governed by the rate at which the unmixed liquids are transported as thin jets along the side walls of the shaker. It was observed that the greater the difference in density between the two liquids, the less efficient their transportation to the mixing zone becomes, thereby reducing the rate of mixing. Below a density ratio of 0.7, mixing is practically non-existent. Above this value the rate of mixing follows a quadratic trend."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1563812303185309459", "cites_id": ["1563812303185309459"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2009/PDFs/125PRA.pdf", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
