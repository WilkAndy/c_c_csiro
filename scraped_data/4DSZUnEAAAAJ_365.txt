This Special Issue of the Geomechanics and Geoengineering Journal is a collection of papers from the 4th International Conference on DEM (DEM 07) held in Brisbane, Australia, in August 2007. The conference itself was divided into several themes covering the spectrum of DEM applications. This issue focuses upon the mining, geomechanics and geophysics technical theme and highlights the great advances in DEM technology that have emerged over the past 30 years.Several recent advancements are featured in this special issue. First, with ever increasing computational power, the DEM is being applied to ever larger 3-D rock masses to provide more realistic predictions of in situ rock mass response. Additionally, it is becoming more common for the DEM to be combined with finite element method (FEM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4163267265768367353", "cites_id": ["4163267265768367353"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17486020902791016", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-aQiMYXlxjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
