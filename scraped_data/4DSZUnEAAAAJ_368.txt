However having a bucket bolted to a flexible belt creates difficulties at the interface of the belt, bucket and head pulley. At the point where a bucket's connection line becomes tangent to the pulley, the tip of the bucket must undergo a very rapid acceleration phase; theoretically infinite. In reality, as the point of tangency is reached, the tip of the bucket lags behind its theoretical position before accelerating and overshooting its nominally correct position. The motion of an empty bucket is a decaying damped oscillation. When the bucket is transporting bulk material then more complex motion occurs. This paper presents preliminary results of an investigation utilising Discrete Element modelling tools to better understand the impact of the transition point on the discharge pattern from the bucket. We anticipate that this will lead to a better understanding of structural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10556418030254853082", "cites_id": ["10556418030254853082"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.232243909777081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2oveqUTuf5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
