In these models the effect of slurry has broadly been ignored due to its complexity. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provides a particle based method for modelling complex free surface fluid flows and is well suited to modelling fluid flow in mills. Previous modelling has demonstrated the powerful ability of SPH to capture dynamic fluid flow effects such as lifters crashing into slurry pools, fluid draining from lifters, flow through grates and pulp lifter discharge. However, all these examples were limited by the ability to model only the slurry in the mill without the charge. In this paper, we represent the charge as a dynamic porous media through which the SPH fluid is then able to flow. The porous media properties (specifically the spatial distribution of porosity and velocity) are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14787891209224028087", "cites_id": ["14787891209224028087"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687506002196", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t3_rhrQkOc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 11, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
