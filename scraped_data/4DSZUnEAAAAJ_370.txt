Following a recent paper [7], we present computational studies of the axi-symmetric collapse of granular columns using the three-dimensional Discrete Element Method. We argue that, in order to obtain quantitative as well as qualitative agreement with the experiments, one has to include the non-spherical nature of the particles in the simulation. We present a systematic study of the effect of particle shape and of important interaction parameters when shape is included. Our conclusion is that three key parameters control the dynamics. These are dynamic friction, static friction, and particle shape."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5085706051558112328", "cites_id": ["5085706051558112328"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5085706051558112328&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SPwsa7UOlEYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
