In particular, the presence of idlers and the catenary shape of the belt between the idlers is shown (by discrete element modelling, (DEM), simulation) to lead to a slow but complex segregation flow, due to both vibration and shear. The dependence of the segregation rates on size and the amount of fines is analysed. Sampling of bulk commodities is frequently done by passing a cutter consisting of a pair of parallel blades through the stream of material as it falls from the head pulley. The accuracy with which this sample represents the original material is very important. Bias in the result can have significant commercial repercussions. A comprehensive study of sample cutter bias is summarised. In particular, it shown that the accepted standard for cutter design leads to an observable bias against the larger particles. other cutters which do not satisfy the standards have undetectable levels of bias. 11 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8400972507783278434", "cites_id": ["8400972507783278434"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/348604", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yq8-Tvw_lnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1}}
