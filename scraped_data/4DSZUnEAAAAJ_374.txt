The most common are the energy and angular momentum integrals. The motions in a system with a full complement of isolating integrals are regular, that is, periodic or quasi-periodic. Such a system is integrable. If there is a deficiency in the number of integrals, then the motions are chaotic. There is a fundamental quantative difference in the motion, depending on the number of integrals. A technique, called Generalised Painlev\u00e9 analysis, based on complex variable theory allows the user to determine if a system is integrable. Two new integrable cases of the Henon-Heiles system are presented, bringing the total number of such integrable potentials to five. It is highly probable that there are no further integrable cases of the Henon-Heiles potential.
