The granular mixture comprises two sets of particles that can differ in intrinsic (particle-scale) properties, such as their size, shape, density, or friction. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was implemented to understand how macroscopic segregation evolves, and the focus was on how the aforementioned particle properties influence segregation. While a difference in particle size is the strongest influence on segregation and produces axial segregation, cubical particles can induce significant radial segregation of the bed. Furthermore, it was found that mixtures of only cubical particles (of different sizes) tend to segregate significantly faster, and the particle bed consolidates to a greater extent than for mixtures of spheres (of different sizes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250922007941", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i0cfL-Em2vwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
