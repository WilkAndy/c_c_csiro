These interactions may include reaction forces between the ground and our feet, downwards acceleration due to gravity and drag forces from water \u2013 such as during swimming. An improved understanding of the relationship between body movement and external body forces can provide insight into the internal forces and torques experienced during activity. These can assist in determining strategies for reducing injury risk and improving performance outcomes. Experimental approaches have been typically limited to the laboratory and to external measurements, except when invasive procedures have been used. They have been limited in application to relatively small datasets due to the number of manual tasks required to capture and process data. However, recent advances in the areas of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012823913100021X", "cites_per_year": {}}
