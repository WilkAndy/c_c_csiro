They are critical for life and their dysfunction leads to health challenges that worsen with ageing. Globally, the dominant cause of death is from cardiovascular disease (stroke, cardiac, vascular) with one-third of deaths attributed directly. Identification of disease states relies on clinical imaging and monitoring predetermined risk factors or known biomarkers. They create significant spatial and temporal challenges for direct measurement. Classification of small geometric and morphological changes is time-consuming and costly. Disease also slowly progresses over years but catastrophic physiological events such as plaque rupture, thrombus blockage and bone fracture can occur suddenly. Modelling of key elements of these systems at different scales can greatly expand our understanding of healthy physiological function \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:c1e4I3QdEKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128239131000270", "cites_per_year": {}}
