To better understand how track surfaces may contribute to equine limb injury, we developed the first 3D computational model of the equine hoof interacting with a racetrack and simulated interactions with model representations of 1) a dirt surface and 2) an all-weather synthetic track. First, a computational track model using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method with a Drucker-Prager (DP) elastoplastic material model was developed. It was validated against analytical models and published data and then calibrated using results of a custom track testing device applied to the two racetrack types. Second, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which model parameters contribute most significantly to the mechanical response of the track under impact-type loading. Third, the SPH \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17125775168595538563&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g7JXk8f5qu0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
