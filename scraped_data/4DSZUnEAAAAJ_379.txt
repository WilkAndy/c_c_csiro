The stratiform chromitites in the Bushveld Complex\u2013the largest 11 magmatic body in the Earth\u2019s crust24\u2013however, offers strong contest to this shifting 12 concept. Several chromitites in this complex occur as layers up to 2 metres in thickness 13 and more than 400 kilometres in lateral extent, implying that chromitite-forming events 14 were chamber-wide phenomena24\u201327. Field relations and microtextural data, specifically 15 the relationship of 3D coordination number and grain size, indicate that the chromitites 16 grew as a 3D framework of touching chromite grains directly at the chamber floor from 17 a melt saturated in chromite only28\u201330. Mass-balance estimates dictate that a 1 to 4 km 18 thick column of this melt26, 31, 32 is required to form each of these chromitite layers. 19 Therefore, an enormous volume of melt (> 1, 00,000 km3) 24, 25 must have been involved in 20"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:RJOyoaXV5v8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-443338/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Uba7Am3z-ysJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
