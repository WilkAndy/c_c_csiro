Predictions for five types of crushers: jaw crusher, cone crusher, gyratory crusher, impact crusher and double roll crusher are presented. The breakage method used is based on facture of particles using geometric rules for progeny generation and estimates of the force applied to the particles as they flow through the crusher. From these simulations, estimates of power, product size, throughput rate and crusher wear are made."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6174592567668553908", "cites_id": ["6174592567668553908"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687514003616", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tLim1DmPsFUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 14, "2017": 16, "2018": 7, "2019": 17, "2020": 19, "2021": 13, "2022": 18, "2023": 4}}
