Data science\u2019s inherent multi-disciplinary nature makes the extraction of useful information challenging, often leading to undiscovered details or new insights. This study explores the potential of statistical learning to identify potential regions of interest for large scale discrete element simulations. We demonstrate that our in-house knowledge discovery and data mining system (KDS) can decompose large datasets into i) regions of potential interest to the analyst, ii) multiple decompositions that highlight different aspects of the data, iii) simplify interpretation of DEM generated data by focusing attention on the interpretation of automatically decomposed regions, and iv) streamline the analysis of raw DEM data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:isU91gLudPYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/03/epjconf_pg2021_15001/epjconf_pg2021_15001.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A4XTTmhq2wQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
