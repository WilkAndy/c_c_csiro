This is of fundamental scientific interest but also has significance in a variety of industries including mining, pharmaceuticals, food processing as well as for natural phenomena such as landslides. Here we consider segregation that occurs when a granular mixture is sheared, such as when it flows down along an inclined slope. A partially filled cylindrical drum is being slowly rotated about its axis (which is perpendicular to gravity) is a popular test-bed to examine sheared granular segregation. Here we consider simulation (Discrete Element Method, DEM), experiment and continuum theories in order to understand the segregation that occurs. Using DEM simulations we can clearly determine the underlying causes of segregation which intimately depend on intrinsic particle properties such as their size, density and shape. We compare these DEM simulations with both experiments and continuum theories, for a number of these properties, and find very good agreement. It will be shown that segregation arising from differences in particle size is the strongest, with stable asymptotic states being reached after only one or two cylinder rotations. Density segregation is the next strongest followed by segregation due to particle shape. The underlying physical mechanism leading to segregation is different in each of these properties. We compare and contrast these mechanisms in detail."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/187119", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OFW-NCEkXO0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
