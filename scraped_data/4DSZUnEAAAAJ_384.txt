This makes it particularly useful in application to solid mechanics problems where the sample undergoes large deformation. Whereas mesh-based methods have difficulty when the sample becomes severely distorted, SPH naturally deals with this important engineering scenario. We implement the SPH method for compressional deformation of solid samples and focus on uniaxial, biaxial and triaxial loading. We develop a numerical procedure that naturally deals with these three different sets of boundary conditions and apply it to both small and larger strains in elastic and more complex materials."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf15/PDFs/062PER.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
