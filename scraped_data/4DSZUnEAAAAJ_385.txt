It summarises the key stages of digestion, their purpose and their manner of operation. Modelling to date for each region of the GI tract is reviewed and the key challenges are discussed.Digestion begins in the mouth as food is broken down, mixed with saliva and agglomerated into a bolus for swallowing. Mechanical, thermal and chemical interactions between parts of the mouth anatomy, the saliva and the ingested food occur. These interactions are extremely difficult to model and data are difficult to obtain, so it is not surprising that there have been few reported efforts to computationally represent this system. Modelling challenges are numerous and include difficulty in developing accurate representations of:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=b02dBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:EsgoIwRuo7gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=tIAjQtH-Nk&sig=rPE8xmLGNRr1Xm1B0fyeSXTDIPo", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EsgoIwRuo7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
