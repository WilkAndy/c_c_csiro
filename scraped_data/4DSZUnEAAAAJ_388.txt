These are usually modelled with N<< n, over a limited dom with a larger particle diameter and the correspo assumption of scale invariance. These assumption however, especially problematic in systems granular material interacts with gas flow, as the dyn of the system depends heavily on n. This has led number of suggested modifications for coupled gas DEM to effectively increase the number of particles simulated. One such approach is for each simu particle to represent a cluster of smaller particles and formulate the DEM based on these clusters. This, k as a \u2018coarse grain\u2019method, pote simulations with N~ n for low computational cos investigate the effectiveness of this coarse grain app for gas flow through particle beds using resolved coarse grain models with the same effective pa numbers. The pressure drop and fluidi characteristics in the beds are measured and comp and the relative saving in computational cost is we against the effectiveness of the coarse grain approach"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu.au/intranet/proceedings/cfd2012/CFD2012/PDFs/139HIL.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
