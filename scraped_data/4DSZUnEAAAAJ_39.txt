It is particularly powerful for predicting complex free surface motion and is able to capture fine features in surfaces with little numerical diffusion. The method has been found to be well suited to modelling die casting processes (such as high pressure die casting). Its Lagrangian (particle) nature also allows SPH materials to undergo substantial deformation, considerably exceeding what is possible with finite element methods before element deformation requires re-meshing. Since SPH particles represent specific pieces of metal, history dependence of properties (such as degree of local strain hardening) are easily included. Application of the SPH method to extrusion and forging processes is explored and potential advantages of this modelling are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17920718760359594824", "cites_id": ["17920718760359594824"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013606004936", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SIvptsMus_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 7}}
