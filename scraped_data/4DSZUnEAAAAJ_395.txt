Heat is transferred to the pellets reducing the metal oxide and forming by products such as gases, metal and slag. This is a complex multi-phase flow with coupled heat transfer and chemical reactions. For many pyrometallurgical processes traditional grid based computational methods, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Volume (or Control Volume methods), produce suitable predictions. However, the inclusion of a large fraction of solids in the liquid metal bath represents significant challenges for these methods.Liquid aluminum is readily oxidized during melt handling, resulting in the formation of dross (a mix of oxide and trapped metal) that must be skimmed off prior to casting. In a typical primary smelter, the net melt loss is~ 1% of total production \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=580179899896142697&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aZshh4s2DQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
