A generic geological system that represents a magmatic body intruded into upper-crustal rocks typical of the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia is modelled using SPH in order to explore patterns of fracture development around such a body. A coupled elastoplastic deformation-fluid flow analysis is conducted to model the fracturing of rocks surrounding the magmatic intrusion. SPH was found to be effective in capturing discrete fracturing processes caused by intruding magma that cannot be easily simulated using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The SPH model predicted fracture patterns in the rocks that were found to compare well with geological structures observed in nature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/17afmc_proceedings/PDF/162_Paper.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1-i620CH29MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
