DEM is a key tool that can be applied to model and better understand such processes. We extend a previous implementation of DEM particle breakage that utilized spherical particles to consider non-spherical particles. Our new implementation uses super-quadric particles, where daughter fragments with realistic size and shape distributions are packed inside a bounding parent super-quadric."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP101671&sb=RECENT&n=2&rpp=10&page=160&tr=5467&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
