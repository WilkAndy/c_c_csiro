Our method takes into account factors such as the local particle orientation and porosity. The method is applied to several multiphase granular systems: Fluidised beds, pneumatic conveying and particle sedimentation. We show that shape plays an important role in the dynamics of each of these systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP10792&sb=RECENT&n=8&rpp=10&page=159&tr=5467&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
