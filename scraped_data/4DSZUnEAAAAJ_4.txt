Industrial applications can be characterized as large, involving complex particulate behaviour in typically complex geometries. In this paper, with a series of examples, we will explore the breadth of large scale modelling of industrial processes that is currently possible. Few of these applications will be examined in more detail to show how insights into the fundamentals of these processes can be gained through DEM modelling. Some examples of our collaborative validation efforts will also be described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 421, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7466545517786981492", "cites_id": ["7466545517786981492"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02644400410519730/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dGT6xpZ_nmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 10, "2007": 9, "2008": 11, "2009": 28, "2010": 19, "2011": 24, "2012": 21, "2013": 23, "2014": 15, "2015": 41, "2016": 32, "2017": 33, "2018": 28, "2019": 27, "2020": 27, "2021": 30, "2022": 20, "2023": 8}}
