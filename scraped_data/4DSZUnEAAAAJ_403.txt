However, current computational models can only capture large scale flow events and are unable to resolve three dimensional meso-scale local flow features. We present a multiscale coupled fluid method, with large scale flow over the full domain coupled with a smaller scale models to more accurately resolve local flow features in regions of interest. Our macroscale model uses a finite volume method based on the shallow water (SW) formulation. This is coupled to a mesoscale Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for solving the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations for the fluid flow, allowing the inclusion of static and dynamic structures within the simulations. We show the viability of our method for predicting both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP092250&sb=RECENT&n=6&rpp=10&page=6&tr=5695&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2009", "cites_per_year": {}}
