Banana screens are high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. While popular, their optimisation provides many challenges because the lower decks are difficult to access for measurement or sampling. Furthermore, these screens have many adjustable parameters and are much less understood than conventional flat vibrating screens. The C-MIS DEM code is now sufficiently powerful to simulate several million particles within a practical time frame. Previous DEM models of vibratory screens are less realistic since they use spheres (or aggregates of spheres) to simulate particles in a process where particle shape is a critical factor. However, the C-MIS code can use \u201csuper quadric\u201d particles, which can represent a wide range of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP092226&sb=RECENT&n=48&rpp=50&page=27&tr=5484&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
