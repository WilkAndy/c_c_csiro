A simulation method that has proved particularly suited to modelling HPDC is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Materials are approximated by particles that are free to move around rather than by fixed grids, enabling more accurate prediction of fluid flows involving complex free surface motion. Three practical industrial examples of SPH simulated HPDC flows are presented; aluminium casting of a differential cover (automotive), an electronic housing and zinc casting of a door lock plate. These show significant detail in the fragmented fluid free surfaces.The validation of flow predictions coupled with heat transfer and solidification is an important area for such modelling. One approach is to use short shots, where insufficient metal is used in the casting or the casting shot is halted part way through to leave the die cavity partially filled. The frozen partial castings capture significant detail of the order of fill and about the flow structures occurring during filling. Validation can occur by matching experimental and simulated short shots. Here we explore the effect of die temperature, metal super-heat and volume fill on the short shots. The bulk features of the final solid castings are found to be in good agreement with the predictions, but the fine details appear to depend on surface behaviour of the solidifying metals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf06/PDFs/107Cle.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xWUBP8nzZt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
