This is illustrated using a laboratory scale uniaxial compression test under different loading conditions. To validate the SPH based approach, the results are compared to matching results using the Finite Element Method. The solutions predicted by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are found to agree well. This paper illustrates the potential of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for accurate and efficient modelling of solid materials that are subjected to compression, and of the resulting elastic wave propagation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf06/PDFs/142Das.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ThqzsGDT_ZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
