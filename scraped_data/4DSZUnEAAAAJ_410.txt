Heat is transferred to the pellets and reaction products such as gases, metal and slag are formed. Many traditional grid based CFD methods, such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Volume (or Control Volume methods), produce suitable predictions. However, the inclusion of solids in the bath presents significant challenges for these methods. The formation and transport of bubbles in the melt and/or slag also creates similar problems. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a Lagrangian simulation method, is able to simulate all three phases; the fluid component of the bath, any immersed solid materials including the tracking of their motion and their interaction with the fluid, and gas generation and transport. The use of coupled discrete bubbles can enable more realistic modelling of the gas phase transport. In this paper, we summarize the key aspects of the SPH method and show a series of examples illustrating the behaviour of the different physics sub-systems that are used in the overall pyrometallurgical model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=c6ed9d43cc7dcf29e5a132ca63a952eb07e96147", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bysA-V23exgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
