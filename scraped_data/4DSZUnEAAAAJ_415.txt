The SPH method used to simulate three dimensional fluid flow is described. Three examples of HPDC are shown. The first is a generic component, the second is a real automotive piston head and the third one is a rack and pinion steering column. In each case the filling of the runner, gate and die are shown. The importance of the order of the die filling is shown as is the role of flow separation from corners and even moderately curved surfaces. The degree of surface fragmentation, droplet formation and the strongly transient nature of the voidage are also shown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dr73CAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA178&dq=info:Jqf-0EQzDukJ:scholar.google.com&ots=OqcNjjKv9S&sig=zmCSNqxvQcKo97tXJuSYCh8N6Cg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jqf-0EQzDukJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
