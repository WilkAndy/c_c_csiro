Such processes are common in a variety of industries, including the production of tablets in the pharmaceutical industry, the manufacture of fertilizer pellets, and agglomeration of wood fibres in the paper industry. The equipment used to facilitate wet granulation varies between industries and applications, but can be broadly classified as tumbling agglomerators (e.g., dish and pan pelletizers) or mixer agglomerators (e.g., paddle mixers, plough-share mixers and peg mixers). Common to all equipment is the need for improved means for controlling final aggregate properties (e.g., particle size distributions, porosity and aggregate strength). In general, these properties will be determined by the nature of inter-particle interactions and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/40647(259)69", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:exn_vukiZaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
