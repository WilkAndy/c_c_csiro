Biennial Conference on Computational Techniques and Applications", "volume": "8", "pages": "131", "publisher": "World Scientific", "abstract": "For older buildings there are few cost effective options for improving inadequate air conditioning. A possible alternative to finding space for larger air ducts is to supplement the original cooling by placing large planar panels within rooms. These are cooled by passing cold water through them. The space requirements for water pipes are substantially smaller than those for air ducts, making this an viable alternative for providing supplementary cooling. The cooling of a room by such panels is by natural convection. The efficiency of the natural convective cooling by these panels depends on their size, number and position. Here we evaluate various alternatives for a simple room with one or two panels attached to the walls or the ceiling. The transient natural convection occurring in these rooms is simulated using the CSIRO finite element package Fastflo. This has been used to study such flows extensively [2, 3, 4, 6, 7]. The accuracy of the method is described in detail in Cleary [2]. The code has been validated against good experimental results for flow around a pair of heated parallel plates in an isothermal enclosure in Cleary [7]. Previous steady state simulation results for this supplementary cooling application were reported in [1]. One variant of this geometry displays a remarkable range of behaviour [4, 6]. Nusselt numbers (Nu) are calculated for Rayleigh numbers (Ra) up to 106, for each of the twenty one alternative geometries, allowing comparisons of the thermal efficiency to be made. Conclusions are drawn about the relative merits of these alternatives."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4503916670025493680&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sGzUPlkggT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
