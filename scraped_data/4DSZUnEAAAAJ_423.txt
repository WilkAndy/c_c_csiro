It is important in many cooling and heating applications, from the cooling of micro-electronic circuitry to heat exchangers to supplementary air conditioning of rooms and buildings.At low and moderate Rayleigh numbers (Ra) the flows are steady and their be haviour is simple. As the Ra is increased towards realistic values, the flows becomes unsteady and increasingly complicated. Time varying jets, plumes and eddies are created on increasing small scales as turbulence is approached. Numerical modelling of these flows at very high Ra is traditionally extremely difficult. Fastjlo, using an operator-splitting methodology is able to model these flows up into the transition to turbulence regime.
