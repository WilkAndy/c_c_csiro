There are two possible asymptotic flows, involving either an upward hot plume (Type I) or downward cold jet (Type II). The flow type depends crucially on both Ra and T o. The structure of the solution space is described. The type II flows have lower heat transfer rates for the same Ra. This causes discontinuities in the Nu (with increasing Ra) and can have important implications for the cooling designs, particularly for micro-electronics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/download/article/1ca439d54cf81251/17-24.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0vSSeyFTy9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
