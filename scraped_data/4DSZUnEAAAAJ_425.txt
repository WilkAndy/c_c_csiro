This information, (velocity, temperature, streamline and heat flux fields throughout the entire flow), is generally unavailable from experimental studies due to limitations in the experimental techniques currently available. Computational results are presented and compared with experimental measurements for heated plates inside an isothermal enclosure, over a range of Rayleigh number, plate spacing, plate inclination and plate position.The paper also describes some potential dangers and misleading results that can emerge when computing these flows. Difficulties arising when performing experimental measurements on physical models of real equipment are also described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444816191501027", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oT1IgWzLWY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
