Integrable systems are the exception and not the rule. One tool currently being used to examine their integrability is Painleve Analysis. This is an analytic technique based on singularity analysis in the complex time plane. In this thesis the effects of generalising the analysis by enlarging the class of admissible singuarities we have examined, and a selection of two dimensional quartic polynomial potentials which were either integrable or close to integrable, found. The integrability of some of these potentials was confirmed by explicit analytic calculation of the second integrals of the motion and numerical Surface of Section calculations. A classification scheme for families of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits based on both the geometry of the orbits and their topological structure in the Surface of Section was developed.
