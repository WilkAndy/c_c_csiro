Specifically, we generated energy dissipation spectra from DEM simulations of binary mixtures of cubical and spherical particles and of large and small particles in a slowly rotating tumbler. Mixtures of spherical particles of varying diameter have a single spectral peak while mixtures of cubical and spherical particle have two broader peaks. We developed an analytic model for these spectra by considering the particles as damped driven oscillators. The functional forms of the driving forces account for the sizes and shapes of the particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8914391430928092899&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:405BpcZHtnsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
