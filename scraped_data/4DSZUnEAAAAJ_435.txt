We simulate a range of preparation methods including pouring, particle expansion, and slow settling of grains in a viscous liquid (Fig. 1). These allow us to generate systems ranging from the densest disordered to the loosest mechanically stable packings [2]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/mawi.inst.110/aktuelles_und_archiv/vortraege/2012/Delaney_Abstract.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gPfKl_Ge4NEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
