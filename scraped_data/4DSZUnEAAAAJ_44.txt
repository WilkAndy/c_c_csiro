The evenness of the flow in the bin depends on the drawdown pattern, which in turn depends on the screw and hopper design, shape of the particles and wall friction effects. A key design requirement is to ensure that a progressive increase in the screws volumetric capacity is achieved along the entire length of the hopper's opening so as to produce even drawdown. If this is not achieved then compositional variations in the outgoing stream and other operational problems (such as caking) can be created. Screw designs to date have been generally based on analytical models and at times the predicted flow pattern is not achieved. In this study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to predict particle transport in a horizontal screw feeder system for a range of conventional screw designs including a variable screw pitch \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15765285516235719655", "cites_id": ["15765285516235719655"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250911005148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:50PXIaaLydoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
