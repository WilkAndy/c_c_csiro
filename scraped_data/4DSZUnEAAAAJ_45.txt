A three\u2010dimensional dam\u2010break flow with a rectangular column located downstream is considered. The net force and impulse exerted on the column is monitored throughout the simulation with the results correlating well with existing experimental data. Initial and boundary conditions and numerical parameters are varied and their effect on the column load investigated. The column load is found to be most sensitive to the choice of boundary treatment.
