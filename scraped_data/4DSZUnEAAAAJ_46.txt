We perform a direct quantitative comparison, across a range of operating conditions, between laboratory scale experiments and simulations using the discrete element method (DEM). We test the extent to which the commonly employed DEM approximation of particles being spherical affects the ability of the model to realistically reproduce the behaviour of industrial screening systems where the particles are generally non-spherical in shape. The simulation geometry and input particle size distribution are set up to exactly match the experimental system, which consists of a horizontal screen with a wire mesh cloth onto which quarry rock is fed at a series of input flow rates. The screen is vibrated, causing the granular bed to flow over the deck and vertically stratify with finer material passing through the screen, where it is collected in a series \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13289480438212305569", "cites_id": ["13289480438212305569"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250911006622", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oaIlQQy4bbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 17, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
