It is necessary to simulate particles of many different sizes and densities interacting with complex shaped lifters and liner. The key ingredients are a fast and robust algorithm to predict collisions, a good collision model and an efficient and powerful method for describing the mill. Particle fows in a S m diameter ball mill are presented The charge behaviour, torque and power draw are analysed for a range of rotation rates from SO to 130% of the critical speed Sensitivity of the results to the choice of friction and restitution coefficients and to the particle size distribution are examined. Segregation is an important issue in rotating mills.
