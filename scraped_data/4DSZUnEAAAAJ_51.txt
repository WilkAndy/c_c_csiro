We extend this consideration to packings of nonspherical grains (ellipsoids) formed by slow settling in a viscous liquid, and perform a detailed analysis of the structural properties of the resulting packings. We find that as in the case of spheres the loosest ellipsoid packings are generated for grains with high interparticle friction. However, unlike spheres, these packings cannot be considered random as they have a significant degree of orientational ordering that increases with the grain\u2019s aspect ratio. This demonstrates that applying sedimentation or pouring techniques that have become part of the commonly held definition of RLP, will not generate random packings of ellipsoids.
