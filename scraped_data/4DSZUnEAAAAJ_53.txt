This technology is still poorly understood when used in the mineral processing context. This makes process optimisation of such devices problematic. 3D DEM simulations of the flow of grinding media in pilot scale tower mills and pin mills are carried out in order to investigate the relative performance of these stirred mills. In the first part of this paper, media flow patterns and energy absorption rates and distributions were analysed to provide a good understanding of the media flow and the collisional environment in these mills. In this second part we analyse steady state coherent flow structures, liner stress and wear by impact and abrasion. We also examine mixing and transport efficiency. Together these provide a comprehensive understanding of all the key processes operating in these mills and a clear understanding of the relative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=799695688901493912", "cites_id": ["799695688901493912"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089268750600210X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mIRi-f0WGQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
