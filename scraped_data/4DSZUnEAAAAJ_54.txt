As our knowledge of breakage and computational capacity improve, it is worth revisiting previous simulation tasks which did not produce a satisfactorily realistic description of a measured process. At SAG 2006, we reported the simulated and measured outcomes of treating a well characterised ore in a 1.2 m diameter mill. This well instrumented, pilot scale mill at the University of KwaZulu-Natal has been combined with some new approaches to ore testing to allow different modes of breakage to be tested. The mill design allows the rate of generation of fine material to be measured in close to real time for autogenous and SAG mill charges. The updated simulation model estimates mass loss with particle evolution and embeds the cumulative damage and breakage.
