These include separation, mixing (such as in making glass and pharmaceuticals), grinding and crushing, blasting, rotary moulding (such as of plastics), commodity sampling, stockpile construction, open cut mining, excavation, generic ows in and from hoppers, silos, bins, conveyor belts and many more.Discrete element modelling (DEM) of granular ows involves following the trajectories and spins of all the particles and objects in the system and predicting their interactions with other particles and with their environment. It is necessary to simulate particles of many different sizes and densities interacting with complex shaped objects moving in a range of different ways. The key ingredients are a fast and robust algorithm to predict collisions, a good collision model and an efficient and powerful method for describing the objects.
