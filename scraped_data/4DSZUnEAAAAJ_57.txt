DEM simulates the motion of the coarser particulates while SPH simulates the slurry (water and finer particulates). This three dimensional method is demonstrated for multiphase mixing flow on a chute, in a central slice of a 36\u2032 SAG mill and in a Hardinge pilot mill. It is shown to be robust and stable and able to predict complex coupled free surface particle and slurry flows including splashing with saturation levels varying from dry to fully saturated. It is suitable for prediction of multiphase flow in moving equipment including small scale structures such as classification grates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1627001563453086006", "cites_id": ["1627001563453086006"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687514003082", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NlmgPk1FlBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
