We propose here a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model coupling the flow of luminal content and wall flexure to help investigate these relationships. The model indicates that a zone of muscular relaxation preceding the contraction is an important element for transport. Low pressures in this zone generate positive thrust for low viscosity content. The viscosity of luminal content controls the localization of the flow and the magnitude of the radial pressure gradient and together with contraction amplitude they control the transport rate. For high viscosity content, high lumen occlusion is required for effective propulsion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15583895298257350626", "cites_id": ["15583895298257350626"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482512000133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4m-C7TQeRdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 9, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 8}}
