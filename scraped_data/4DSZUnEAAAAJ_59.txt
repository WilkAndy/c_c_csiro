While spherical media in tower mills has previously been studied, real grinding media shape in stirred mills can range from spherical (steel/ceramic balls) to highly non-spherical (sand or slag) resulting in very different media and grinding dynamics. Handling the contact mechanics of non-spherical particles is a challenge for numerical models, and very few studies dealing with non-spherical particle shape exist in the literature. Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of dry media flow in a pilot-scale tower mill are performed for four cases with different shaped grinding media, in order to understand how flow and energy utilisation within a stirred mill depend on media shape. Differences in media transport, stress distribution, energy dissipation, and liner wear were observed in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13202773260119887166", "cites_id": ["13202773260119887166"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687510003031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ps14K1SsObcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
