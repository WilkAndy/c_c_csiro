In an attempt to provide some insight into the matter, this paper describes results obtained from a discrete particle computer simulation of landslides composed of up to 1,000,000 two\u2010dimensional discs. While simplified, the results show many of the characteristics of field data (the volumetric effect on runout, preserved strata, etc.) and with allowances made for the two\u2010dimensional nature of the simulation, the runouts compare well with those of actual landslides. The results challenge the current view that landslides travel as a nearly solid block riding atop a low friction basal layer. Instead, they show that the mass is completely shearing and indicate that the apparent friction coefficient is an increasing function of shear rate. The volumetric effect can then be understood.
