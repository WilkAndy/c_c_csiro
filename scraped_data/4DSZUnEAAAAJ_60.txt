A plough share mixer is one machine used for such particulate mixing. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to understand the performance of a laboratory mixer when mixing elongated particles (rice grains). Previously, such modelling approximated the particles as spherical which led to too shallow an angle of repose for the bed surface. Using a much more realistic representation of the particle shape leads to better representation of the bed strength due to increased numbers of contacts with neighbouring particles and the inability to fail by in-situ rolling. This leads to strong differences in process performance including a reduction in the fraction of the bed influenced by the blade, large increases in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3992450904564031031", "cites_id": ["3992450904564031031"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591013004166", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N9653fEIaDcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
