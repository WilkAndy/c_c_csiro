Chipping and rounding are mechanisms that lead to preferential mass loss from corners and edges of particles and which produce shape change for the particles as well as size reduction. These are controlled by the energy dissipation at a contact and the location of the contact on the surfaces of the particles. These mechanisms lead to rounding or conditioning of angular feed particles. Single impact body breakage is a very weak contributor to overall size reduction with most body breakage occurring via damage accumulation over many contacts. This incremental damage mechanism is inherently less inefficient but leads to size reduction from the many weak collisions experienced by particles within the mill. Finally, size reduction from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14434262780969286463", "cites_id": ["14434262780969286463"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687515301382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P_tQ9oXNUMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 16, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
