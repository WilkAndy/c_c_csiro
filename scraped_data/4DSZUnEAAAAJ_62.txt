Rogue wave impacts cannot easily be handled by traditional analytic or computational techniques. Here we use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the fully non-linear dynamics of a large breaking wave on a semi-submersible tension leg platform. We consider the effect of wave impact angle and mooring line pre-tension on the subsequent motion of the platform, and predict the maximum tension in each mooring line. The primary effect of wave impact angle is to determine the peak mooring line tension and line \u201cslackness\u201d during wave impact. A 45\u00b0 impact results in the maximum tension on the leading line. The maximum heave, surge and pitch vary only slightly with wave angle. As mooring line pre-tension is increased, the duration of heave and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15261964501325237023", "cites_id": ["15261964501325237023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801813000218", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H8scRNpjzdMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
