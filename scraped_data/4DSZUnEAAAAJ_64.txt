Mechanical and chemical breakdown of food takes place throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Periodic muscular contraction and relaxation of the intestinal walls agitate, mix and propel the multiphase digesta along the intestines. Experimental measurement of flow inside the intestines is difficult therefore understanding of food transport through the majority of the gut is limited. Computational models for predicting the transient behaviour of intestinal content subject to peristaltic activity offer the possibility for assessing the digestive performance of different foods. We present a numerical model for peristalsis in the duodenum using a suspension of rigid particulates in a viscous Newtonian fluid to represent simple digesta. This consists of a thin viscoelastic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6595912913339415964", "cites_id": ["6595912913339415964"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X17300409", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nP0BGdljiVsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 9, "2021": 17, "2022": 24, "2023": 9}}
