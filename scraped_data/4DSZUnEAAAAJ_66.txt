The breakage model uses a replacement strategy and impact energy specific progeny size data from a Drop Weight Test (DWT). There is a strong variation in the breakage behaviour with height in the compression region as the differing profiles of the concave and mantle create five different regions with monotonically decreasing width and differing degrees of convergence between the surfaces. These control the rate of motion and the ability to load and break the particles, and determine whether high forces are generated via multi-particle stress chains or as single particle loading directly from the liner surfaces.
