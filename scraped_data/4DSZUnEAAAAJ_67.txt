For SAG mills, a large fraction of the feed material can now be accurately represented in DEM models. However, for other mill types with much finer feed materials, such as the second chamber of a cement ball mill, the vast numbers of feed particles makes their explicit inclusion in the models prohibitive. However, it is now feasible to model a periodic section of a laboratory scale ball mill and include the coarser end of the ore size distribution directly in the DEM model. This provides the opportunity to better understand the effect of media on the interstitial bed of powder and of the effect of the powder on the media. The effect of the powder fill level, which is varied between 0% and 150% of the pore space in the media charge, is explored.
