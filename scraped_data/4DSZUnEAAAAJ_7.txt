With the need for more accurate and sophisticated models, the introduction of computational models like the discrete element method (DEM) has started to solve some of the complex problems in comminution. This review article provides a general, though not exhaustive, overview of the application of computational techniques to the science of comminution.Over the last two decades the DEM has become an important tool for understanding comminution fundamentals and providing information for the design, optimisation and operation of comminution devices. Over that time, the application of DEM in simulating fracture, breakage, crushing, milling and equipment wear has increased in size and complexity. Information from DEM has contributed to modelling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 329, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8241501015159484102", "cites_id": ["8241501015159484102"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591013003902", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xi6aCIKxX3IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 11, "2015": 33, "2016": 30, "2017": 30, "2018": 38, "2019": 35, "2020": 49, "2021": 36, "2022": 45, "2023": 18}}
