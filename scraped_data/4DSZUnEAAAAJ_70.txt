Both approaches showed the development of two loops of circulation, one on either side of the plough. Particles are pushed forward through the bed by the plough and then picked up and thrown through the space above the bed, before falling to the surface and then slowly flowing back into the trench left behind the plough blade. The flow patterns obtained experimentally were compared to those obtained using DEM for a speed of 2.25Hz and showed reasonable qualitative agreement. However, the angle of repose of the trench down which the avalanching back flow occurs was found to be too shallow in the DEM predictions. This is due to the rice grains being represented as spheres in the model \u2014 a demonstration of the modelling penalty in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10289944292799000840,15169989077198144318,13550162465868698438,5715392697572284225", "cites_id": ["10289944292799000840", "15169989077198144318", "13550162465868698438", "5715392697572284225"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591012003282", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CLHX2tA5zY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
