The granular dynamics occurring during raceway formation is still, however, not fully understood as there are significant technical difficulties to experimentally gathering data within an active particle bed. We use a coupled Discrete Element and Navier\u2013Stokes numerical solver to simulate these systems in order to investigate the dependency of raceway formation and dynamics on gas injection velocity, particle shape and bed pressure. Lateral gas injection into a particle bed is found to give a transition from static to circulating particle flow at a specific gas inflow velocity. A theoretical model is presented, based on a force balance at the gas inlet location, giving an expression for this gas inflow velocity. This model gives good agreement with numerical simulations, showing that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1005650904585247999", "cites_id": ["1005650904585247999"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250912004009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_5zaZyvK9A0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
