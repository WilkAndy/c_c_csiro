In particular, we study how a minimum in the normal stress can occur under the highest part of the sandpile. It is found that piles composed of particles with the same size do not show a minimum in the normal stress. A stress minimum is only observed when the piles are composed of particles with different sizes, where the particles are size segregated in an ordered, symmetric, circular fashion, around the central axis of the sandpile. If a pile is composed of particles with different sizes, where the particles are randomly distributed throughout the pile, then no stress dip is observed. These results suggest that the stress dip is due to ordered, force contacts between equiheight particles which direct stress to the outer parts of the pile."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=413089401454835855", "cites_id": ["413089401454835855"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s100350100086", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j7gxOp-WuwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 9, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
