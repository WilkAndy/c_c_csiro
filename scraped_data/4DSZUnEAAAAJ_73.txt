Current examples of such modelling for dry industrial granular flows (DEM only applications) focuses on mixing and digging of non-ideal shaped particles in complex moving geometries. For the mixer, increasing the number of plough blades improves the rate of mixing due to a larger overlap of the swept paths of the blades with the bed and reduces the size of the dead zones between the blades and between the blades and the end of the mixer. For the dragline filling, the impact with a large mostly submerged boulder creates lateral forces and yawing components to the torque but the rock flow and dragline motion are collectively able to force the boulder into the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4149859239213306928", "cites_id": ["4149859239213306928"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591016307653", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MJQuvf1ClzkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
