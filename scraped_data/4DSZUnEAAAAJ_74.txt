Numerical simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method are used to solve for the fluid flow around the moving impellor. The mixing flow is visualised by extracting the hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) of the flow from the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which provides qualitative information about the topology of the mixing structures and highlights the major barriers to transport. This is combined with a mixing measure that calculates the degree of mixing between different regions. A single helical ribbon mixer (SHR) was found to create an axially symmetric circulation cell that moves fluid down the outside of the tank and upward near the centre. Smaller circulation cells near the inside edge of the ribbon superimpose a chaotic mixing flow over this primary flow, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4478901513327481410", "cites_id": ["4478901513327481410"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250912005490", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QhLYNTJBKD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
