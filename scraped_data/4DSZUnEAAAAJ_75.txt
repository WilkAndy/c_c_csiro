Computations invariably fail after some level of mesh distortion is reached unless suitable re-meshing is implemented to cope with the mesh distortion arising from the material deformation. The issue of mesh distortion and the subsequent re-meshing are topics of much research for grid based methods. These problems can be overcome by using a mesh-less numerical framework. In this paper, the application of a mesh-less method called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for modelling three-dimensional complex forging processes is demonstrated. It is shown that SPH is a useful simulation method for obtaining insights into the material deformation and flow pattern during forging of realistic industrial components.
