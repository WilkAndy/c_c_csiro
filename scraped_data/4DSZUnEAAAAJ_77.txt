The rotation rates used produce a flow that is on the borderline between the avalanching and rolling regimes. The simulations replicate the experimental data well at both qualitative and quantitative levels. Both wall-induced and radial segregation are observed. The simulations show segregation is delineated into two main time regimes. At early times segregation is rapid (when the dense core is being established) and slows down appreciably thereafter. The final asymptotic state is found to be independent of the initial segregation state of the particles. We compare these results with previous theoretical models and relate these two distinct time regimes to the underlying segregation mechanisms. These comparisons suggest segregation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10738653209787665590", "cites_id": ["10738653209787665590"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-010-0223-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:toyAzzJcB5UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
