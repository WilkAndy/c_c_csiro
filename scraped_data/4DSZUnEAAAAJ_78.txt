This device potentially offers several advantages over a screw elevator, though due to its recent conception, there is a significant amount about its operation that is not fully understood. This paper presents both DEM simulation results and laboratory data gained in a program designed to improve our understanding of the particle flow within the OLDS elevator."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18275935910335391407", "cites_id": ["18275935910335391407"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591009001843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r6ZYYeEqof0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 11, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
