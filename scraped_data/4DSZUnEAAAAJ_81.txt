The simulation results were able to capture the fine detail of the free surface motion, including plume shape, frequency and phase of oscillation and the correct relative heights of the surface levels at all free surfaces."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14004713988166006827", "cites_id": ["14004713988166006827"], "pub_url": "https://www.cfd.com.au/cfd_conf99/papers/045HA.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KziUDSy9WsIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
