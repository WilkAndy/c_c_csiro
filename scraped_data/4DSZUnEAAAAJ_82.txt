They are typically rotating cylinders with diameters from 3 to 6m and lengths from 6 to 12m. The flow of particulate solids within these mills can be modelled using the discrete element method (DEM). Typically, such modelling is done for short durations of a few mill revolutions and either in two dimensions or using thin three-dimensional slices through the center of the mill with periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction. This facilitates an understanding of the radial motion of the charge, estimation of power draw and of liner wear, but it cannot provide information about axial transport within the mill. In this paper, we examine the axial transport in dry ball mills. This requires simulation of the entire mill and the full volume of the charge for significant periods of time (thousands of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13805869378129332801", "cites_id": ["13805869378129332801"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X06000308", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QYrXgg1NmL8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
