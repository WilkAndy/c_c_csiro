The agreement with experiment for both numerical methods is very good, but the SPH solutions tend to capture free surface and void shapes modestly better than the VOF and also predict small scale structure better. These result from the Lagrangian nature of SPH and the superior mass conservation properties of this particle method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17060502295606153889", "cites_id": ["17060502295606153889"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13640461.2000.11819378", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oVJXi3IUw-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 8, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
