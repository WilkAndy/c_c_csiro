SPH, being Lagrangian, is very well suited to these momentum dominated flows with complex free surface behaviour including fragmentation. The filling of three classes of die shapes with isothermal fluid is analysed for Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 50 to 50,000. Realistic and very complex flow patterns with recirculations, vortices, back filling, droplet and fragment formation are predicted. Many classes of casting defects can be explained by these flow patterns. Invariance of the numerical results to simulation resolution is demonstrated. Finally, a water analogue experimental set is described and used to produce data with which to validate the numerical predictions. These comparisons are very favourable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1722540675339576481", "cites_id": ["1722540675339576481"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13640461.2000.11819372", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oeTGKJ6x5xcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
