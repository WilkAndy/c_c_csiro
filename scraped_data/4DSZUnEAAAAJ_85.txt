Mass transport is simply the motion of the particles, and its grid\u2010free nature means that it can easily accommodate complicated geometries involving moving parts and sharp corners. This article describes 2D SPH simulations of a Twin Cam mixer and compares the results against experimental data and results from two published finite element method (FEM) simulations. To analyze the mixing processes in the Twin Cam mixer, we present a method for calculating the Finite\u2010Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using SPH particle data. The FTLEs can be used to locate the unstable and stable manifolds in the flow and indicate where mixing is either promoted or inhibited in the flow. We also present a local measure of how two or more fluids are \u201cmixed\u201d at a point in the domain.
