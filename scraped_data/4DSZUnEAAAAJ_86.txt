Controlling the distribution of the coating material during coating operations is essential for ensuring factors such as homogeneity in the coating thickness and prevention of agglomeration, which are common requirements in most types of coating applications. Despite the significant industrial and commercial importance of spray coating, few numerical models have been developed to model this process. Here, we detail the first computational model to incorporate particles, coating spray droplets and gas flow, dynamically interacting over an entire coating system. Particles and gas flow are modelled using a coupled DEM-CFD method, and spray droplets are modelled as individual Stokesian particles within the gas flow field.
