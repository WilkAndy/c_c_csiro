Porosity and velocity distributions of 5mm, mono-sized glass spheres in a 300mm diameter mill are statistically compared to an equivalent dry DEM model. These show a very high degree of spatial agreement with RMS differences of only 0.11%. Typically, around 80% of the mill volume is found to have identical results. Similar levels of agreement are found for a range of operating speeds from 31% to 75% of critical speed. These demonstrate that a solid particle DEM model of the charge, without an explicit representation of the slurry, is able to accurately capture the motion of the solid charge \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16212848270238246482", "cites_id": ["16212848270238246482"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250913002820", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UmbbOJqb_-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 7}}
