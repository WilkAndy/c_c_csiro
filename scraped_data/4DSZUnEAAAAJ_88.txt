Poor transport of finer ground material can adversely affect grinding leading to excess energy consumption and over-grinding of fine material. This paper uses a 1-way coupled DEM\u2013SPH method in three dimensions to analyse the full slurry flow for a 1.8m diameter by 0.6m long AG/SAG pilot mill. This provides detailed information on the internal flow of slurry within a SAG mill, including the prediction of dry regions and of slurry pooling. The importance of the end walls in generating complex three dimensional recirculation patterns in the charge and its influence on axial flow is demonstrated. Such a full 3D analysis ensures that the slurry is presented to the grate with a realistic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4990659537188802489", "cites_id": ["4990659537188802489"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687512002233", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uc8NTWhiQkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
