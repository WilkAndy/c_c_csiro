It is important to accurately predict the flow behaviour so that potential mitigation strategies can be investigated for disaster management planning. The meshless SPH method has previously been able to model this class of extreme flow events. In this paper, we extend the method to include modelling of dam wall fragments. Collisions between dam wall fragments, between fragments and terrain and full two-way coupling between fragments and the free surface water flow is included. This gives a method that can specifically investigate the impact of the dam wall failure scenario on the subsequent inundation. The historical St. Francis dam failure is used to demonstrate the impact of including the dam fragments. It also provides a means of quantitatively investigating their effect in terms of arrival time and water height at a downstream power station \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18012246851803943842", "cites_id": ["18012246851803943842"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X14001140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ohNsKBRb-PkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 12, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 6}}
