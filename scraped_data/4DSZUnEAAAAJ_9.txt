Specifically, changes in charge fill level, lifter shape (either by design or wear) and lifter pattern are analysed. The effects of changes to the properties of the charge (ball fraction, ball and rock shape, type of ball and rock size distributions and the lower cutoff of the rock size distribution) can all be interpreted in terms of their effects on the shear strength of the charge. Some changes increase the shear strength leading to higher dynamic angles of repose of the charge, higher shoulder positions and higher power consumption for sub-critical speeds. For super-critical speeds, they lead to lower power consumption, due to lower particle mobility as the particles lock together better. Changes to the charge that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 243, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7916641518166689085", "cites_id": ["7916641518166689085"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751601000370", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PUVvQISP3W0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 12, "2014": 11, "2015": 23, "2016": 21, "2017": 23, "2018": 15, "2019": 21, "2020": 19, "2021": 17, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
