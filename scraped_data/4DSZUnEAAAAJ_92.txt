It has been extensively studied in recent years, both experimentally and computationally. Among the various modelling investigations in the literature, a large number have considered the problem of a single particle impacting a substrate by means of a continuum technique, most commonly the finite element method. These models that have been used previously are generally based on two inadequate assumptions, namely 1) both particle and substrate are assumed to initially be at room temperature, and 2) the experimentally observed increase in strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress at high strain rates is ignored. To investigate the combined effect of temperature and strain rates, a three-dimensional model of a single particle impact with a metallic substrate has been developed using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7850589396225459901", "cites_id": ["7850589396225459901"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897214005015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vYZ3L3bl8mwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 9, "2023": 8}}
