Currently, the number of particles which can be tractably modelled using DEM is several orders of magnitude lower than the number of particles present in common large-scale industrial systems. Practical approaches to modelling such industrial system therefore usually involve modelling over a limited domain, or with larger particle diameters and a corresponding assumption of scale invariance. These assumption are, however, problematic in systems where granular material interacts with gas flow, as the dynamics of the system depends heavily on the number of particles. This has led to a number of suggested modifications for coupled gas\u2013grain DEM to effectively increase the number of particles being simulated. One such approach is for each simulated particle to represent a cluster of smaller particles and to re \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12017364099105618068", "cites_id": ["12017364099105618068"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X14000602", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lPi4N_pAxqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
