In the past, several studies have considered segregation due to different sized particles or different density particles. The physical mechanisms that lead to segregation are different in these two cases. Few studies have considered the important (practical) situation where particles differ both in size and density, which is what we consider here. Depending on particle sizes and densities the two mechanisms either oppose or enhance each other. We consider both cases here and find when the two mechanisms oppose each other size segregation is generally stronger than density segregation. We also determine stability regions for the various patterns that form. When the mechanisms enhance each other we find, under some specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9117247874253884695", "cites_id": ["9117247874253884695"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10035-014-0511-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:F40W6qL4hn4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 7}}
