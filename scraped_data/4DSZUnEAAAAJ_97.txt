Columns made of alternately coloured sand layers are initially laid out in a box and then released when a retaining wall is set in slow motion with constant speed. The flow of the sand involves failure of the granular material along multiple slip planes at different stages of the deformation, leading to complex flow patterns. DEM simulations, in 2D and 3D, are able to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce a range of essential elements of this flow, with particle shape being an important contributor to the mobilisation of specific slip planes. We also examine the sensitivity of the DEM predictions to changes in the operating, material and simulation parameters. We find that DEM predictions are invariant to changes of moving wall speed, spring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15383938089134692591", "cites_id": ["15383938089134692591"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17486020902767388", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:75h5OS-6ftUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
