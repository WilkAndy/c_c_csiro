Predictions for a range of types of hammer mills, vertical and horizontal shaft impactors are presented. The breakage method used is based on fracture of particles using geometric rules for progeny generation and estimates of the stress applied to the particles as they flow through the crusher. From these simulations, estimates of power, product size, throughput rate and crusher wear are made."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1598958586487206252", "cites_id": ["1598958586487206252"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089268751400394X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bHEh3lykMBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 8}}
