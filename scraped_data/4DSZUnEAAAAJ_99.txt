The flow involves significant fragmentation and spray formation as the high pressure liquid jets into the die from the gate system. An important class of die cast components is one with large areas of thin walls. An example of this is the chassis of the laptop computer. Computational modelling provides an opportunity to both better understand the filling process and to optimize the runner, gates, flash overs and venting systems for the die. SPH has previously been found to be very suitable for predicting HPDC for bulkier automotive components. The modelling challenges arising from the very thin sections and the many flow paths in a laptop chassis require careful validation. A water analogue experiment is used to validate the predictions of the SPH model for this representative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4DSZUnEAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10407559290401665850", "cites_id": ["10407559290401665850"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40571-014-0025-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OjM1cwgUb5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
