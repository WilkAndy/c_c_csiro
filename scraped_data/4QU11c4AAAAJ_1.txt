Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 \u00b1 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year\u20131) globally for 1990 to 2007. We also estimate a source of 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 Pg C year\u20131 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 \u00b1 0.5 Pg C year\u20131 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 \u00b1 0.5 Pg C year\u20131. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 \u00b1 0.8 Pg C year\u20131, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. Our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 6844, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10615053937654787086", "cites_id": ["10615053937654787086"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1201609", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DmyGuVA_UJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 31, "2012": 198, "2013": 352, "2014": 412, "2015": 463, "2016": 593, "2017": 571, "2018": 670, "2019": 689, "2020": 716, "2021": 835, "2022": 866, "2023": 382}}
