This can only be achieved through a drastic reduction of global CO2 emissions. Yet fossil fuel emissions increased by 29% between 2000 and 2008, in conjunction with increased contributions from emerging economies, from the production and international trade of goods and services, and from the use of coal as a fuel source. In contrast, emissions from land-use changes were nearly constant. Between 1959 and 2008, 43% of each year's CO2 emissions remained in the atmosphere on average; the rest was absorbed by carbon sinks on land and in the oceans. In the past 50 years, the fraction of CO2 emissions that remains in the atmosphere each year has likely increased, from about 40% to 45%, and models suggest that this trend was caused by a decrease in the uptake of CO2 by the carbon sinks in response to climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 2283, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5813202270436618624", "cites_id": ["5813202270436618624"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo689", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gHHeUKqkrFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 10, "2010": 141, "2011": 231, "2012": 237, "2013": 284, "2014": 225, "2015": 220, "2016": 149, "2017": 150, "2018": 143, "2019": 110, "2020": 107, "2021": 87, "2022": 109, "2023": 44}}
