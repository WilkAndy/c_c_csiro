Further, record high temperatures and droughts are leading to negative impacts on carbon sinks. We suggest that, together, these two phenomena might drive a shift from a period dominated by the positive effects of fertilization to a period characterized by the saturation of the positive effects of fertilization on carbon sinks and the rise of negative impacts of climate change. We discuss the evidence and processes that are likely to be leading to this shift."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4972754520686943017", "cites_id": ["4972754520686943017"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0274-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KVvDyOPFAkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 18, "2019": 12, "2020": 38, "2021": 42, "2022": 41, "2023": 19}}
