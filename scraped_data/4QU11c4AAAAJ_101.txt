Here we show a strong and persistent coupling (r2 \u2248 0.50) between interannual variations of the CO2 growth rate and tropical land\u2013surface air temperature during 1959 to 2011, with a 1 \u00b0C tropical temperature anomaly leading to a 3.5 \u00b1 0.6 Petagrams of carbon per year (PgC/y) CO2 growth-rate anomaly on average. Analysis of simulation results from Dynamic Global Vegetation Models suggests that this temperature\u2013CO2 coupling is contributed mainly by the additive responses of heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and net primary production (NPP) to temperature variations in tropical ecosystems. However, we find a weaker and less consistent (r2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13748498808712732703", "cites_id": ["13748498808712732703"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1219683110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HyA06NJ6zL4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 11, "2015": 18, "2016": 17, "2017": 22, "2018": 29, "2019": 19, "2020": 18, "2021": 16, "2022": 10, "2023": 7}}
