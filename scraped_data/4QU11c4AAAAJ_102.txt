Global fossil CO 2 emissions have grown three years consecutively:+ 1.5% in 2017,+ 2.1% in 2018, and our slower central projection of+ 0.6% in 2019 (range of\u20130.32% to 1.5%) to 37\u00b12 Gt CO 2 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data accepted), after a temporary growth hiatus from 2014 to 2016. Economic indicators and trends in global natural gas and oil use suggest a further rise in emissions in 2020 is likely. CO 2 emissions are decreasing slowly in many industrialized regions, including the European Union (preliminary estimate of\u2212 1.7%[\u20133.4% to+ 0.1%] for 2019,\u2212 0.8%/yr for 2003\u20132018) and United States (\u2212 1.7%[\u20133.7% to+ 0.3%] in 2019,\u2212 0.8%/yr for 2003\u20132018), while emissions continue growing in India \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:9DLIHnF0jcYC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16548944242734262134", "cites_id": ["16548944242734262134"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab57b3/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dufr0xupqeUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 31, "2021": 52, "2022": 55, "2023": 18}}
