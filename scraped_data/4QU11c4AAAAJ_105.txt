However, studies show that the potential for carbon (C) sequestration in no\u2010till farming sometimes is not realized, let alone the ability to maintain or improve crop yield. Here we present a global analysis of no\u2010till\u2010induced changes of soil C and crop yield based on 260 and 1,970 paired studies; respectively. We show that, relative to local conventional tillage, arid regions can benefit the most from conservation agriculture by achieving a win\u2010win outcome of enhanced C sequestration and increased crop yield. However, more humid regions are more likely to increase SOC only, while some colder regions have yield losses and soil C loss as likely as soil C gains.
