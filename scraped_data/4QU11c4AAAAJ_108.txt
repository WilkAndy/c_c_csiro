Despite the importance of CH 4 as a greenhouse gas, its atmospheric growth rate and dynamics over the past two decades, which include a stabilization period (1999\u20132006), followed by renewed growth starting in 2007, remain poorly understood. We provide an updated estimate of CH 4 emissions from wetlands, the largest natural global CH 4 source, for 2000\u20132012 using an ensemble of biogeochemical models constrained with remote sensing surface inundation and inventory-based wetland area data. Between 2000\u20132012, boreal wetland CH 4 emissions increased by 1.2 Tg yr\u2212 1 (\u2212 0.2\u20133.5 Tg yr\u2212 1), tropical emissions decreased by 0.9 Tg yr\u2212 1 (\u2212 3.2\u2212 1.1 Tg yr\u2212 1), yet globally, emissions remained unchanged at 184\u00b122 Tg yr\u2212 1. Changing air temperature was responsible for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9854976713448828799", "cites_id": ["9854976713448828799"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa8391/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fy_dYhvpw4gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 15, "2019": 34, "2020": 27, "2021": 28, "2022": 24, "2023": 6}}
