Here we summarize what we know about the maximum rooting depth of species belonging to the major terrestrial biomes. We found 290 observations of maximum rooting depth in the literature which covered 253 woody and herbaceous species. Maximum rooting depth ranged from 0.3 m for some tundra species to 68 m for Boscia albitrunca in the central Kalahari; 194 species had roots at least 2 m deep, 50 species had roots at a depth of 5 m or more, and 22 species had roots as deep as 10 m or more. The average for the globe was 4.6\u00b10.5 m. Maximum rooting depth by biome was 2.0\u00b10.3 m for boreal forest. 2.1\u00b10.2 m for cropland, 9.5\u00b12.4 m for desert, 5.2\u00b10.8 m for sclerophyllous shrubland and forest, 3.9\u00b10.4 m for temperate coniferous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 2170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13401157547627767089", "cites_id": ["13401157547627767089"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00329030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MeVlhcl5-rkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 6, "1998": 22, "1999": 26, "2000": 27, "2001": 29, "2002": 28, "2003": 40, "2004": 53, "2005": 53, "2006": 50, "2007": 67, "2008": 69, "2009": 71, "2010": 97, "2011": 107, "2012": 95, "2013": 93, "2014": 130, "2015": 127, "2016": 139, "2017": 143, "2018": 156, "2019": 113, "2020": 143, "2021": 119, "2022": 97, "2023": 45}}
