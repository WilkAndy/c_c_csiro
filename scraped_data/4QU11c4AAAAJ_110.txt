We examine the current state and recent trajectories of 19 ecosystems, spanning 58\u00b0 of latitude across 7.7 M km2, from Australia's coral reefs to terrestrial Antarctica. Pressures from global climate change and regional human impacts, occurring as chronic \u2018presses\u2019 and/or acute \u2018pulses\u2019, drive ecosystem collapse. Ecosystem responses to 5\u201317 pressures were categorised as four collapse profiles\u2014abrupt, smooth, stepped and fluctuating. The manifestation of widespread ecosystem collapse is a stark warning of the necessity to take action. We present a three\u2010step assessment and management framework (3As Pathway Awareness, Anticipation and Action) to aid strategic and effective mitigation to alleviate further degradation to help secure our future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=503709350233989385", "cites_id": ["503709350233989385"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15539", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CWG9OvyI_QYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 40, "2022": 59, "2023": 30}}
