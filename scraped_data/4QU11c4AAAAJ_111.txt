These carbon stores range from dead leaves and wood to the fossil carbon in coal, oil and gas. They contain large amounts of usable chemical energy. When the ancestors of modern humans learned to access this energy by mastering fire, they discovered a \u2018new trick\u2019 which led to massive evolutionary advantages for the human species. In the technological explosion of the last two centuries, industrial-scale use of energy flows from fossil carbon has not only transformed human societies and ecosystems, but also caused exponentially increasing accumulation of the released carbon in atmospheric, land and ocean carbon reservoirs. These changes have altered the carbon cycle and other cycles of matter and energy in the earth system, leading to the term \u2018Anthropocene\u2019 for the current epoch.
