We investigated whether the effects of elevated $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ on plant\u2014microbial N dynamics differed among six annual plant species; three European grasses that have invaded California grasslands, and one grass and two forbs native to California serpentine grassland. Elevated $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ altered plant N pools and ${15}\\mathrm{NH}_4+$ uptake, but the direction and magnitude of the changes were species dependent. The introduced grasses showed increased plant N pools and ${15}\\mathrm{NH}_4+$ uptake, whereas the native species showed smaller increases or even decreases in plant N pools and $15{\\mathrm{NH}_4+$ uptake.
