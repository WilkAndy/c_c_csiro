They are a potentially vast fossil fuel energy source but, at the same time, could be destabilized by changing pressure\u2013temperature conditions due to climate change, potentially leading to strong positive carbon\u2013climate feedbacks. To enhance our understanding of both the vulnerability of and the opportunity provided by methane hydrates, it is necessary (i) to conduct basic research that improves the highly uncertain estimates of hydrate occurrences and their response to changing environmental conditions, and (ii) to integrate the agendas of energy security and climate change which can provide an opportunity for methane hydrates\u2014in particular if combined with carbon capture and storage\u2014to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16448174315126043355", "cites_id": ["16448174315126043355"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/4/3/034007/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:27LKuGSnQ-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 7, "2011": 10, "2012": 10, "2013": 15, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 3, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
