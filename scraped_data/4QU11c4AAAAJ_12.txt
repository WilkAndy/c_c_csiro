Many international borders were closed and populations were confined to their homes, which reduced transport and changed consumption patterns. Here we compile government policies and activity data to estimate the decrease in CO 2 emissions during forced confinements. Daily global CO 2 emissions decreased by\u201317%(\u201311 to\u201325% for\u00b11\u03c3) by early April 2020 compared with the mean 2019 levels, just under half from changes in surface transport. At their peak, emissions in individual countries decreased by\u201326% on average. The impact on 2020 annual emissions depends on the duration of the confinement, with a low estimate of\u20134%(\u20132 to\u20137%) if prepandemic conditions return by mid-June, and a high estimate of\u20137%(\u20133 to\u201313%) if some restrictions remain worldwide until the end of 2020 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC", "num_citations": 2024, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9574087516296585408", "cites_id": ["9574087516296585408"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-%200797-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wCBc0d793YQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 390, "2021": 827, "2022": 599, "2023": 159}}
