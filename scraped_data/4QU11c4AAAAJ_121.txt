No mortality was observed in either species. Individual plant size, measured as the individual stump area, was the most important factor determining both number and biomass of resprouts for all fire treatments. The number of resprouts at 3 months was less at the higher temperature, but no difference could not be detected at 18 months. Duration of flame application had no effect on resprouting success. This effect was not statistically significant 18 months after treatments were applied. Biomass of resprouts was not clearly affected by different fire treatments either 3 months or 18 months after the start of the resprouting process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10361360484825104594", "cites_id": ["10361360484825104594"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00045210", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0gDFz3byyo8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 6, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 9, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
