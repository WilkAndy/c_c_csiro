Flux estimates were based on top-down methods that use inversions of atmospheric data, and bottom-up methods that use field observations, satellite data, and terrestrial ecosystem models. Based on atmospheric CO2 inversions, the net biospheric CO2 flux in South Asia (equivalent to the Net Biome Productivity, NBP) was a sink, estimated at \u2212104 \u00b1 150 Tg C yr\u22121 during 2007\u20132008. Based on the bottom-up approach, the net biospheric CO2 flux is estimated to be \u2212191 \u00b1 193 Tg C yr\u22121 during the period of 2000\u20132009. This last net flux results from the following flux components: (1) the Net Ecosystem Productivity, NEP (net primary production minus heterotrophic respiration) of \u2212220 \u00b1 186 Tg C yr\u22121 (2) the annual net carbon flux from land-use change of \u221214 \u00b1 50 Tg C yr\u22121, which resulted from a sink of \u221216 Tg C yr\u22121 due to the establishment of tree plantations and wood harvest, and a source of 2 Tg C yr\u22121 due to the expansion of croplands; (3) the riverine export flux from terrestrial ecosystems to the coastal oceans of +42.9 Tg C yr\u22121; and (4) the net CO2 emission due to biomass burning of +44.1 \u00b1 13.7 Tg C yr\u22121. Including the emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels of 444 Tg C yr\u22121 for the 2000s, we estimate a net CO2 land\u2013atmosphere flux of 297 Tg C yr\u22121. In addition to CO2, a fraction of the sequestered carbon in terrestrial ecosystems is released to the atmosphere as CH4.
