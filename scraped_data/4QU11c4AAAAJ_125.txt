The current structure, composition and distribution of Australian savannas have coevolved with fire, yet remain driven by the dynamic constraints of their bioclimatic niche. Fire in Australian savannas influences both the biophysical and biogeochemical processes at multiple scales from leaf to landscape. Here, we present the latest emission estimates from Australian savanna biomass burning and their contribution to global greenhouse gas budgets. We then review our understanding of the impacts of fire on ecosystem function and local surface water and heat balances, which in turn influence regional climate. We show how savanna fires are coupled to the global climate through the carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13843037599977030180", "cites_id": ["13843037599977030180"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12686", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JMIBh1pZHMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 15, "2017": 11, "2018": 11, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 21, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
