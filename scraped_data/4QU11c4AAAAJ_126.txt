Here we describe and synthesise data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \u00b11\u03c3. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 % relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at 10.1 \u00b1 0.5 GtC yr-1 (9.9 \u00b1 0.5 GtC yr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), ELUC was 1.1 \u00b1 0.7 GtC yr-1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission of 11.1 \u00b1 0.8 GtC yr-1 (40.8 \u00b1 2.9 GtCO2).
