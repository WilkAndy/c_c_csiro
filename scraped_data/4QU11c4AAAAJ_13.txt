By reacting with hydroxyl radicals, methane reduces the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and generates ozone in the troposphere. Although most sources and sinks of methane have been identified, their relative contributions to atmospheric methane levels are highly uncertain. As such, the factors responsible for the observed stabilization of atmospheric methane levels in the early 2000s, and the renewed rise after 2006, remain unclear. Here, we construct decadal budgets for methane sources and sinks between 1980 and 2010, using a combination of atmospheric measurements and results from chemical transport models, ecosystem models, climate chemistry models and inventories of anthropogenic emissions. The resultant budgets suggest that data-driven \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 1955, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6664854011114993184", "cites_id": ["6664854011114993184"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1955", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ILZYRGlRflwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 81, "2015": 149, "2016": 216, "2017": 230, "2018": 216, "2019": 234, "2020": 241, "2021": 241, "2022": 230, "2023": 88}}
