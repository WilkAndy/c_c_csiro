Here we analyse recent changes in the net land carbon sink (NLS) and its driving factors, using atmospheric inversions and terrestrial carbon models. We show that the linear trend of NLS during 1998\u20132012 is about 0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 Pg C yr\u22122 , which is three times larger than during 1980\u20131998 (0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 Pg C yr\u22122). According to terrestrial carbon model simulations, the intensification of the NLS cannot be explained by CO2 fertilization or climate change alone. We therefore use a bookkeeping model to explore the contribution of changes in land-use emissions and find that decreasing land-use emissions are the dominant cause of the intensification of the NLS during the slow warming period. This reduction of land-use emissions is due to both decreased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10376107592516732417", "cites_id": ["10376107592516732417"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0204-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AYYxY-FW_48J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 16, "2020": 22, "2021": 9, "2022": 30, "2023": 19}}
