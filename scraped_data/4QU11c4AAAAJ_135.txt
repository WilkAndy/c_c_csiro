Indirect LUC can occur when land currently cropped for non-energy production is diverted for biofuel feedstock cultivation. The diverted crops must then be made up for by converting other arable land, usually native systems. Studies have shown that the possible GHG emissions from the induced LUC can substantially influence the climate benefit of biofuels production and use (Leemans et al. 1996; Schlamadinger et al. 2001; Fargione et al. 2008; Searchinger et al. 2008; Gibbs et al. 2008). Recent studies by Fargione et al.(2008) and Gibbs et al.(2008) show that land-use conversion from native land-uses to biofuel crops lead consistently to significant GHG emissions and a negative carbon balance, or carbon-debt, for decades to centuries. The only instances where clearing native habitat for food-based biofuel crops has a payback time of less than ten years is for grasslands converted to sugarcane or oil palm, because these are the lowest carbon ecosystems and the highest yielding crops (Gibbs et al. 2008). Palm is best suited to areas currently containing rainforest, so the scenario of grassland conversion to oil palm is unlikely.Cropland and abandoned cropland are potential sources of land for biofuels. Currently cropped land will have no direct carbon debt, but may have indirect effects, as mentioned above. Abandoned cropland is often suggested as an ideal source of land for biofuel production (Campbell et al. 2008). However, after cropland is abandoned it may accumulate carbon, which typically takes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13867148521738570363", "cites_id": ["13867148521738570363"], "pub_url": "https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/46284/scope.1245782006.pdf?sequence=2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e4rP9RsCcsAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 21, "2012": 16, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
