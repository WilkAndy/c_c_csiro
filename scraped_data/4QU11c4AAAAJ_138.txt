In this paper, we present the main thematic areas of an ongoing global research agenda and prioritize future needs based on relevance for the evolution of the carbon\u2013climate\u2013human system. These include firstly, the delivery of routine updates of global and regional carbon budgets, including its attribution of variability and trends to underlying drivers; secondly, the assessment of the magnitude of the carbon\u2013climate feedback; and thirdly, the exploration of pathways to climate stabilization and their uncertainties. Underpinning much of this research is the optimal deployment of a global carbon monitoring system that includes biophysical and socio-economic components."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=924182011655911432", "cites_id": ["924182011655911432"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343510000758", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CHiOoKRa0wwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 13, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
