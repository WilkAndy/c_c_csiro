The mean NH terrestrial CO2 sink from the inversion models is 1.7PgCyear\u22121 over the period 2000\u20132004. The uncertainty of this estimate is based on the typical individual (1-sigma) precision of one inversion (0.9PgCyear\u22121) and is consistent with the min\u2013max range of the four inversion mean estimates (0.8PgCyear\u22121). Inversions agree within their uncertainty for the distribution of the NH sink of CO2 in longitude, with Russia being the largest sink. The land-based accounting estimate of NH carbon sink is 1.7PgCyear\u22121 for the sum of the six regions studied. The 1-sigma uncertainty of the land-based estimate (0.3PgCyear\u22121) is smaller than that of atmospheric inversions, but no independent land-based flux estimate is available to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1556307592524163159", "cites_id": ["1556307592524163159"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343510000539", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V2ilfYIdmRUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 10, "2012": 15, "2013": 7, "2014": 14, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
