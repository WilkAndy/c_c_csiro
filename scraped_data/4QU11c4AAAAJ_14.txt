This carbon uptake is therefore limiting the extent of atmospheric and climatic change, but its long-term nature remains uncertain. Here we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of global and regional patterns of carbon exchange by terrestrial ecosystems. Atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen data confirm that the terrestrial biosphere was largely neutral with respect to net carbon exchange during the 1980s, but became a net carbon sink in the 1990s. This recent sink can be largely attributed to northern extratropical areas, and is roughly split between North America and Eurasia. Tropical land areas, however, were approximately in balance with respect to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 1822, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3002988087689045792", "cites_id": ["3002988087689045792"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/35102500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IGdvV8HBrCkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 58, "2003": 81, "2004": 107, "2005": 124, "2006": 95, "2007": 116, "2008": 93, "2009": 77, "2010": 90, "2011": 131, "2012": 88, "2013": 96, "2014": 97, "2015": 84, "2016": 105, "2017": 68, "2018": 56, "2019": 62, "2020": 51, "2021": 47, "2022": 48, "2023": 19}}
