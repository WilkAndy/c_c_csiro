This N2O component was previously estimated as indirect emissions from agricultural soils with large uncertainties\u2013. Here, we present an improved model representation of nitrogen and N2O processes of the land\u2013ocean aquatic continuum constrained with an ensemble of 11 data products. The model\u2013data framework provides a quantification for how changes in nitrogen inputs (fertilizer, deposition and manure), climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and terrestrial processes have affected the N2O emissions from the world\u2019s streams and rivers during 1900\u20132016.
