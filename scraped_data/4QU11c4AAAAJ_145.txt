Global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP)\u2014the rate of carbon fixation by photosynthesis\u2014is estimated to have risen by (31 \u00b1 5)% since 1900, but the relative contributions of different putative drivers to this increase are not well known. Here we identify the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration as the dominant driver. We reconcile leaf\u2010level and global atmospheric constraints on trends in modeled biospheric activity to reveal a global CO2 fertilization effect on photosynthesis of 30% since 1900, or 47% for a doubling of ca above the pre\u2010industrial level. Our historic value is nearly twice as high as current estimates (17 \u00b1 4)% that do not use the full range of available constraints.
