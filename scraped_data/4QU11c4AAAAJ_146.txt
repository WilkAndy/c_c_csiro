We describe new developments that extend the applicability of CABLE for regional and global carbon\u2013climate simulations, accounting for vegetation responses to biophysical and anthropogenic forcings. A land use and land cover change module driven by gross land use transitions and wood harvest area was implemented, tailored to the needs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Novel aspects include the treatment of secondary woody vegetation, which benefits from a tight coupling between the land use module and the Population Orders Physiology (POP) module for woody demography and disturbance-mediated landscape heterogeneity. Land use transitions and harvest associated with secondary forest tiles modify the annually resolved patch age distribution within secondary vegetated tiles, in turn affecting biomass accumulation and turnover rates and hence the magnitude of the secondary forest sink. Additionally, we implemented a novel approach to constrain modelled GPP consistent with the coordination hypothesis and predicted by evolutionary theory, which suggests that electron-transport- and Rubisco-limited rates adjust seasonally and across biomes to be co-limiting. We show that the default prior assumption \u2013 common to CABLE and other LSMs \u2013 of a fixed ratio of electron transport to carboxylation capacity at standard temperature ( \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6005726011056874538", "cites_id": ["6005726011056874538"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/11/2995/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KmRew_yfWFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 13, "2020": 27, "2021": 16, "2022": 17, "2023": 11}}
