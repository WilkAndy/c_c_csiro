We assess five vulnerabilities: (1) effects of increasing CO2 on the partition of anthropogenic carbon between atmospheric, land and ocean reservoirs; (2) effects of climate change (quantified by temperature) on CO2 fluxes; (3) uncertainty in climate sensitivity; (4) non-CO2 radiative forcing and (5) anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Our analysis uses a physically based expression for Tp(Qp), the peak warming Tp associated with a cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emission Qp to the time of peak warming. The approximations in this expression are evaluated using a non-linear box model of the carbon-climate system, forced with capped emissions trajectories described by an analytic form satisfying integral and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14181841725465779336", "cites_id": ["14181841725465779336"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2010.00521.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iFwzI-kF0MQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 15, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
