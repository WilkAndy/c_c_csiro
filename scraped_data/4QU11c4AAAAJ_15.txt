In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically, exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 1784, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3250094424360556170", "cites_id": ["3250094424360556170"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/58/8/701/380621", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ihZ9wqinGi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 45, "2010": 77, "2011": 123, "2012": 119, "2013": 147, "2014": 132, "2015": 154, "2016": 157, "2017": 147, "2018": 136, "2019": 130, "2020": 123, "2021": 114, "2022": 107, "2023": 40}}
