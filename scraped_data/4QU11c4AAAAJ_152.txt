Here, we re-evaluate global cropland-N2O emissions in 1961\u20132014, using N-rate-dependent emission factors (EFs) upscaled from 1206 field observations in 180 global distributed sites and high-resolution N inputs disaggregated from sub-national surveys covering 15593 administrative units. Our results confirm IPCC Tier 1 default EFs for upland crops in 1990\u20132014, but give a \u223c15% lower EF in 1961\u20131989 and a \u223c67% larger EF for paddy rice over the full period. Associated emissions (0.82 \u00b1 0.34 Tg N yr\u20131) are probably one-quarter lower than IPCC Tier 1 global inventories but close to Tier 3 estimates. The use of survey-based gridded N-input data contributes 58% of this emission \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:c59VksA5Vz4C", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10981278759367808236", "cites_id": ["10981278759367808236"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-abstract/7/2/441/5530920", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7BSpr9lWZZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 11, "2021": 27, "2022": 29, "2023": 11}}
