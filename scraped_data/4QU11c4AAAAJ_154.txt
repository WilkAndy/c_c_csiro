For instance, belowground structures accounted for up to 83% of the total biomass in 13 Mediterranean woody communities (Hilbert and Canadell 1995), and belowground primary production was 60\u201380% of the total net primary production in a variety of woody systems (Coleman 1976; \u00c5gren et al. 1980; Fogel 1985). Yet both root biomass and production are infrequently studied and technical difficulties make the measurements often inaccurate. Furthermore, plant root distribution and maximum rooting depths play important roles in overall ecosystem function, but it was not until recently that ecosystem-level and global comprehensive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8637763673078655767", "cites_id": ["8637763673078655767"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-58618-7_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F2ugu0uA33cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 9, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
