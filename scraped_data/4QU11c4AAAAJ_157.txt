Using multiple observations (land\u2010atmosphere fluxes, biomass, streamflow and remotely sensed vegetation cover) and two state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art biospheric models, we show that climate variability and extremes lead to positive or negative responses in the biosphere, depending on vegetation type. We find Australia to be a global hot spot for variability, with semi\u2010arid ecosystems in that country exhibiting increased carbon uptake due to both asymmetry in the interannual distribution of rainfall (extrinsic forcing), and asymmetry in the response of gross primary production (GPP) to rainfall change (intrinsic response). The latter is attributable to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7237567049062319772", "cites_id": ["7237567049062319772"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13412", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nIZuheIAcWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
