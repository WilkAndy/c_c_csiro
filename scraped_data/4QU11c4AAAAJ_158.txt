These CO2 \"sinks\" are modulated by climate change and variability. Here we use a suite of nine dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and four ocean biogeochemical general circulation models (OBGCMs) to estimate trends driven by global and regional climate and atmospheric CO2 in land and oceanic CO2 exchanges with the atmosphere over the period 1990\u20132009, to attribute these trends to underlying processes in the models, and to quantify the uncertainty and level of inter-model agreement. The models were forced with reconstructed climate fields and observed global atmospheric CO2; land use and land cover changes are not included for the DGVMs. Over the period 1990\u20132009, the DGVMs simulate a mean global land carbon sink of \u22122.4 \u00b1 0.7 Pg C yr\u22121 with a small significant trend of \u22120.06 \u00b1 0.03 Pg C yr\u22122 (increasing sink). Over the more limited period 1990\u20132004, the ocean models simulate a mean ocean sink of \u22122.2 \u00b1 0.2 Pg C yr\u22121 with a trend in the net C uptake that is indistinguishable from zero (\u22120.01 \u00b1 0.02 Pg C yr\u22122). The two ocean models that extended the simulations until 2009 suggest a slightly stronger, but still small, trend of \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.01 Pg C yr\u22122. Trends from land and ocean models compare favourably to the land greenness trends from remote sensing, atmospheric inversion results, and the residual land sink required to close the global carbon budget. Trends in the land sink are driven by increasing net primary production (NPP), whose statistically significant trend of 0.22 \u00b1 0.08 Pg C yr\u22122 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10314392474048368898", "cites_id": ["10314392474048368898"], "pub_url": "https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/95608", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ApGdoU4VJI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 19, "2015": 14, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 6}}
