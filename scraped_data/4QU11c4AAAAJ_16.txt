Yet how global vegetation is responding to the changing environment is not well established. Here we use three long-term satellite leaf area index (LAI) records and ten global ecosystem models to investigate four key drivers of LAI trends during 1982\u20132009. We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25% to 50% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO 2 fertilization effects explain 70% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9%), climate change (8%) and land cover change (LCC)(4%). CO 2 fertilization effects explain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 1684, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16889672985171079364", "cites_id": ["16889672985171079364"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3004.", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xDCiPRgsZOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 30, "2017": 110, "2018": 171, "2019": 206, "2020": 255, "2021": 349, "2022": 379, "2023": 167}}
