The availability of numerous products creates a need to understand the level of consistency between products, and reasons for inconsistencies. We evaluate the consistency of six FAPAR products (MODIS, MERIS, SeaWIFS, MODIS-TIP, SPOT-VEG, and AVHRR) across the Australian continent, using multi-year records. We find that seemingly large differences in FAPAR products over much of Australia can be explained by a simple offset present in certain products. Additional inconsistencies arise from different sensitivities in FAPAR to changes in vegetation cover. These inconsistencies can in turn be partially attributed to changes in biome type that are relevant to certain products and related model-specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12166442468137997648", "cites_id": ["12166442468137997648"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425713002952", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UJWX1fbi16gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
