Here, we review current understanding of the impacts of climate change on fire weather (weather conditions conducive to the ignition and spread of wildfires) and the consequences for regional fire activity as mediated by a range of other bioclimatic factors (including vegetation biogeography, productivity and lightning) and human factors (including ignition, suppression, and land use). Through supplemental analyses, we present a stocktake of regional trends in fire weather and burned area (BA) during recent decades, and we examine how fire activity relates to its bioclimatic and human drivers. Fire weather controls the annual timing of fires in most world regions and also drives inter\u2010annual variability in BA in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:c1AJUTjuCtUC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2810448932473437511", "cites_id": ["2810448932473437511"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020rg000726", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R31052m4ACcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 21, "2023": 47}}
