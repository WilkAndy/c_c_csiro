While the immediate effects of CO2 on leaf photosynthesis are well known, these effects can lead to changes in allocation patterns and other properties at the whole-plant level (Strain, 1985) that are not well known or understood. For example, elevated CO2 can modify leaf photosynthetic capacity and alter gross morphology (Larigauderie et al., 1988), influence interactions among plants (Bazzaz and Carlson, 1984), and alter net ecosystem carbon exchange with the atmosphere (Hilbert et al., 1987). This chapter discusses the importance of allocation in determining whole-plant responses to CO2, reviews some of the general characteristics of woody plants from Mediterranean-type ecosystems that may influence their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15663776731509147728", "cites_id": ["15663776731509147728"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4186-7_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UMihcvLpYNkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 9, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
