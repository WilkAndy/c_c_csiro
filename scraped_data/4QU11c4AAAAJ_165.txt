We analyse species distribution and abundance from about 33 000 forest inventory plots in Spain sampled twice over a period of 10\u201312 years. We show a dominance of range contraction (extinction), and demographic decline over range expansion (colonization), with seven of 11 species exhibiting extinction downhill of their distribution. Contrary to expectations, these dynamics are not always consistent with climate warming over the study period, but result from legacies in forest structure due to past land use change and fire occurrence. We find that these changes have led to the expansion of broadleaf species (i.e. family Fagaceae) over areas formerly dominated by conifer species (i.e. family Pinaceae), due to the greater capacity of the former to respond to most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13424788605991324121", "cites_id": ["13424788605991324121"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2QnTDBxuTroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
