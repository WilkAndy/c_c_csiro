Mediterranean-type climates, which are characterized by a predominantly winter rainfall regime, exist in five regions of the world: parts of California, South Africa, Chile, southern Australia, and the Mediterranean basin. Even though all of these regions share broad climatic conditions and contain ecosystems that have similar structures and dynamics (Hobbs et al. 1995), each region has a unique history of human habitation and use. There is a long history of comparative biotic studies among these regions upon which we draw; however, there are no comparisons of the social drivers of land-use change among these areas. Our analyses are therefore less complete than we would like."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14097692940213454780", "cites_id": ["14097692940213454780"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-0157-8_9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vIf0TQkRpcMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
