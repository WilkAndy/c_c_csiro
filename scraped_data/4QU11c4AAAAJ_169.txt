These new research approaches need to deal with an unprecedented level of integration and coordination of multiple disciplines and data streams generated by different scientific communities, institutions and countries (Canadell et al. 2000).In the early 1990s, the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) developed the approach of terrestrial transects for global change research as a way to address large spatial phenomena with both regional and global implications (Steffen et al. 1992; Koch et al. 1995; Steffen et al. 1999). The IGBP Terrestrial Transects were established in critical regions of the world in order to cover most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3282916010426733909", "cites_id": ["3282916010426733909"], "pub_url": "https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-vegetation-science/volume-13/issue-3/1100-9233_2002_013_0298_IGTTDO_2.0.CO_2/IGBP-GCTE-terrestrial-transects--Dynamics-of-terrestrial-ecosystems-under/10.1658/1100-9233(2002)013[0298:IGTTDO]2.0.CO;2.full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VZXtxLdCjy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
