Concerns about the permanency of forest carbon stocks, difficulties in quantifying stock changes, and the threat of environmental and socioeconomic impacts of large-scale reforestation programs have limited the uptake of forestry activities in climate policies. With political will and the involvement of tropical regions, forests can contribute to climate change protection through carbon sequestration as well as offering economic, environmental, and sociocultural benefits. A key opportunity in tropical regions is the reduction of carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 1506, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1804209513486753308", "cites_id": ["1804209513486753308"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1155458", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HB7CT_7WCRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 6, "2009": 49, "2010": 67, "2011": 71, "2012": 103, "2013": 116, "2014": 89, "2015": 117, "2016": 114, "2017": 113, "2018": 111, "2019": 130, "2020": 115, "2021": 111, "2022": 119, "2023": 57}}
