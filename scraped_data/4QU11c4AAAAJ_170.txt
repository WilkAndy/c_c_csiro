Here we compile a new synthetic dataset on anthropogenic GHG emissions for 1970\u20132018 with a fast-track extension to 2019. Our dataset is global in coverage and includes CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, as well as those from fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and provides country and sector details. We build this dataset from the version 6 release of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v6) and three bookkeeping models for CO2 emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF). We assess the uncertainties of global greenhouse gases at the 90 % confidence interval (5th\u201395th percentile range) by combining statistical analysis and comparisons of global emissions inventories and top-down atmospheric measurements with an expert judgement informed by the relevant scientific literature. We identify important data gaps for F-gas emissions. The agreement between our bottom-up inventory estimates and top-down atmospheric-based emissions estimates is relatively close for some F-gas species (\u223c 10 % or less), but estimates can differ by an order of magnitude or more for others. Our aggregated F-gas estimate is about 10 % lower than top-down estimates in recent years. However, emissions from excluded F-gas species such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:e84hm74t-eoC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11014709348061772443", "cites_id": ["11014709348061772443"], "pub_url": "https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/5213/2021/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m3plK8sb3JgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 33, "2023": 23}}
