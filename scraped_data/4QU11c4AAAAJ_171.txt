For nine regions covering nearly the whole globe, we collected inventory estimates of carbon-stock changes complemented by satellite estimates of biomass changes where inventory data are missing. The net land\u2013atmospheric carbon exchange (NEE) was calculated by taking the sum of the carbon-stock change and lateral carbon fluxes from crop and wood trade, and riverine-carbon export to the ocean. Summing up NEE from all regions, we obtained a global \u2018bottom-up\u2019 NEE for net land anthropogenic CO2 uptake of \u20132.2 \u00b1 0.6 PgC yr\u22121 consistent with the independent top-down NEE from the global atmospheric carbon budget during 2000\u20132009. This estimate is so far the most comprehensive global bottom-up carbon budget accounting, which set up an important milestone for global carbon-cycle studies.
