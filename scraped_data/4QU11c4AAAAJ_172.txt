It is hardly conceivable. Yet the infinitely more existence-threatening planetary social and ecological crisis we refer to as \u2018global change\u2019 (comprising the linked issues of biogeochemical, climate, biotic and human system change) is in an analogous situation. Our information on the profound and accelerating changes currently depends to an unacceptable degree on serendipity, individual passion, redirected funding and the largely uncoordinated efforts of a few nations. The thesis of this paper is that navigation of the very narrow \u2018safe passages\u2019 that lie ahead requires a comprehensive and systematic approach to Earth observations, supported by a globally coordinated long-term funding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16645759674652768706", "cites_id": ["16645759674652768706"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534709001232", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wjkzKDueAecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 4}}
