We address three fundamental research areas that require major development if we were to provide policy relevant knowledge for managing the carbon-climate system over the next few decades. The three research areas are: (i) carbon observations and multiple constraint data assimilation; (ii) vulnerability of the carbon-climate system; and (iii) carbon sequestration and sustainable development."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17837440502698090331", "cites_id": ["17837440502698090331"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-004-3765-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Wx98YaFRi_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
