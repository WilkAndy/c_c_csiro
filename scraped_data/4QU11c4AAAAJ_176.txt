An understanding of the relationship between forest carbon (C) stock, and environmental conditions and forest structure enable prediction of the impacts of climate change on C stocks and help to define management strategies that maximize the value of forests for C mitigation. Based on the national forest inventory of Spain (1997\u20132008 with 70,912 plots), we estimated the forest C stock and spatial variability in Peninsular Spain and, we determined the extent to which the observed patterns of stand C stock can be explained by structural and species richness, climate and disturbances. Spain has an average stand C stock of 45.1 Mg C/ha. Total C stock in living biomass is 621 Tg C (7.8% of the C stock of European forests). The statistical models show that structural richness, which is driven by past land use and life forest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8009921324313187261", "cites_id": ["8009921324313187261"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-012-9582-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vZODjgH1KG8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
