A multi-model ensemble of 14 OH fields was analyzed and aggregated into 64 scenarios to force the offline atmospheric chemistry transport model LMDz (Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique) with a standard CH4 emission scenario over the period 2000\u20132016. The multi-model simulated global volume-weighted tropospheric mean OH concentration ([OH]) averaged over 2000\u20132010 ranges between 8.7\u00d7105 and 12.8\u00d7105\u2009molec\u2009cm\u22123. The inter-model differences in tropospheric OH burden and vertical distributions are mainly determined by the differences in the nitrogen oxide (NO) distributions, while the spatial discrepancies between OH fields are mostly due to differences in natural emissions and volatile organic compound (VOC) chemistry. From 2000 to 2010, most simulated OH fields show an increase of 0.1\u20130.3\u00d7105\u2009molec\u2009cm\u22123 in the tropospheric mean [OH], with year-to-year variations much smaller than during the historical period 1960\u20132000. Once ingested into the LMDz model, these OH changes translated into a 5 to 15\u2009ppbv reduction in the CH4 mixing ratio in 2010, which represents 7\u2009%\u201320\u2009% of the model-simulated CH4 increase due to surface emissions. Between 2010 and 2016, the ensemble of simulations showed that OH changes could lead to a CH4 mixing ratio uncertainty of \u2009ppbv.
