However, the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of N2O emissions due to different management practices (excreta deposition and manure/fertilizer application) from grassland ecosystems remain unclear. In this study, we used the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model to simulate the spatiotemporal variation in global N2O emissions and their attribution to different sources from both intensively managed (pasturelands) and extensively managed (rangelands) grasslands during 1961\u20132014. Over the study period, pasturelands and rangelands experienced a significant increase in N2O emissions from 1.74 Tg N2O\u2010N in 1961 to 3.11 Tg N2O\u2010N in 2014 (p < 0.05). Globally, pasturelands and rangelands were responsible for 54% (2.2 Tg N2O\u2010N) of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:A8cqit5AE6sC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7555821972205619142", "cites_id": ["7555821972205619142"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GB006091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xkdoHw2s22gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 20, "2022": 10, "2023": 9}}
