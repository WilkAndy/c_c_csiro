We take the commonly used FAOSTAT\u2010based global Land Use Harmonization data (LUH2) and a new high\u2010resolution multisource harmonized national LULCC database (YLmap) to drive a land ecosystem model (DLEM) in the conterminous United States. We found that recent cropland abandonment and forest recovery may have been overestimated in the LUH2 data derived from national statistics, causing previously reported C emissions from land use have been underestimated due to the definition of cropland and aggregated LULCC signals at coarse resolution. This overestimation leads to a strong C sink (30.3 \u00b1 2.5 Tg C/year) in model simulations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:jmjb1lOE9QIC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8662659967462554742", "cites_id": ["8662659967462554742"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14768", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:djya-lfzN3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 11, "2021": 12, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
