However, accurate assessments of mitigation potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in direct emission factors (EFs). To assess where and why EFs differ, we created high-resolution maps of crop-specific EFs based on 1,507 georeferenced field observations. Here, using a data-driven approach, we show that EFs vary by two orders of magnitude over space. At global and regional scales, such variation is primarily driven by climatic and edaphic factors rather than the well-recognized management practices. Combining spatially explicit EFs with N surplus information, we conclude that global mitigation potential without compromising crop production is 30% (95% confidence interval, 17\u201353%) of direct soil emissions of N2O, equivalent to the entire direct soil emissions of China and the United States \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12824171602967648674", "cites_id": ["12824171602967648674"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00384-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:otmJpSCc-LEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 26, "2023": 18}}
