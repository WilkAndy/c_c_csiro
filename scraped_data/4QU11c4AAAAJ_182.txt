With this in view, this study synthesizes the carbon source/sink due to net ecosystem productivity (NEP), land cover land use change (E LUC), fires and fossil burning (E FIRE) for the South Asia (SA), Southeast Asia (SEA) and South and Southeast Asia (SSEA= SA+ SEA) and each country in these regions using the multiple top-down and bottom-up modeling results. The terrestrial net biome productivity (NBP= NEP\u2013E LUC\u2013E FIRE) calculated based on bottom-up models in combination with E FIRE based on GFED4s data show net carbon sinks of 217\u00b1147, 10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11707437680099828851", "cites_id": ["11707437680099828851"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/10/105006/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c6RfmIoseaIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
