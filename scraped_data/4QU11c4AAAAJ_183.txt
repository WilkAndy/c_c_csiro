Over the past decade, this field of research has advanced through understanding of the differences and similarities of two fundamentally different approaches: \u201ctop\u2010down\u201d atmospheric inversions and \u201cbottom\u2010up\u201d biosphere models. Since the first studies were undertaken, these approaches have shown an increasing level of agreement, but disagreements in some regions still persist, in part because they do not estimate the same quantity of atmosphere\u2013biosphere CO2 exchange. Here, we conducted a thorough comparison of CO2 budgets at multiple scales and from multiple methods to assess the current state of the science in estimating CO2 budgets.
