Using newly released atmospheric CO2 measurements and an atmospheric inversion model, Wang et al. 2 estimated China\u2019s land carbon sink to be 1.11\u00b10.38 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr\u2212 1; positive values indicate net ecosystem carbon uptake) on average for the years 2010\u20132016, which is at least twice the previous inversion estimates of between 0.18 and 0.51 Pg C yr\u2212 1 (refs. 3, 4)(Fig. 1. Here we show that the land carbon sink estimate by Wang et al. 2 is overestimated, because it is ecologically implausible and not supported by bottom-up evidence from ground and satellite observations, and the biases of representing Shangri-La site observations in a coarse-resolution transport model could have led to the extremely large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:yJjnfzR0HrkC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11341385060863897192", "cites_id": ["11341385060863897192"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04255-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aO62pZ-xZJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 22, "2023": 18}}
