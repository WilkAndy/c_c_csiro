These stands had developed on soils derived from eight different parent materials. Three soil groups were differentiated according to their chemical properties: calcareous soils, siliceous soils, and volcanic soils. Across sites, nutrient concentrations were generally less variable in current-year tissues than in older tissues. Nitrogen and potassium showed the lowest variability among sites, their concentrations in current-year leaves ranging from 1.17% to 1.39% for N and from 0.53% to 0.68% for K. There were few statistically significant correlations between tissue element concentrations, the most frequent being the antagonistic relationship between calcium and magnesium.
