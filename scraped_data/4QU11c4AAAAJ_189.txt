Here, we decompose the global budget into 19 regions (18 land and 1 oceanic) and five key source sectors to spatially attribute the observed global trends. A comparison of top\u2010down (TD) (atmospheric and transport model\u2010based) and bottom\u2010up (BU) (inventory\u2010 and process model\u2010based) CH4 emission estimates demonstrates robust temporal trends with CH4 emissions increasing in 16 of the 19 regions. Five regions\u2014China, Southeast Asia, USA, South Asia, and Brazil\u2014account for >40% of the global total emissions (their anthropogenic and natural sources together totaling >270 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 in 2008\u20132017). Two of these regions, China and South Asia, emit predominantly anthropogenic emissions (>75 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:txeM2kYbVNMC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16470758772071796350", "cites_id": ["16470758772071796350"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15901", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fg59Xtbjk-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 22, "2023": 12}}
