These are technologies that result in the net removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. We quantify potential global impacts of the different NETs on various factors (such as land, greenhouse gas emissions, water, albedo, nutrients and energy) to determine the biophysical limits to, and economic costs of, their widespread application. Resource implications vary between technologies and need to be satisfactorily addressed if NETs are to have a significant role in achieving climate goals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 1231, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11897310279110374877", "cites_id": ["11897310279110374877"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2870;", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3TX6CKq8G6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 76, "2017": 122, "2018": 208, "2019": 159, "2020": 188, "2021": 194, "2022": 187, "2023": 76}}
