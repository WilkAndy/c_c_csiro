Because mitigating most anthropogenic emissions of methane is uncertain this century, and sudden methane releases from the Arctic or elsewhere cannot be excluded, technologies for methane removal or oxidation may be required. Carbon dioxide removal has an increasingly well-established research agenda and technological foundation. No similar framework exists for methane removal. We believe that a research agenda for negative methane emissions\u2014\u2018removal' or atmospheric methane oxidation\u2014is needed. We outline some considerations for such an agenda here, including a proposed Methane Removal Model Intercomparison Project (MR-MIP).This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Rising \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:hHIA4WEVY-EC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12890608974762536247", "cites_id": ["12890608974762536247"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2020.0454", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N-0ur5Ck5LIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 22, "2023": 10}}
