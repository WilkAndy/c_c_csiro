Despite the relevance of methane (CH 4) in human-induced climate change and air pollution chemistry, there is no scientific consensus on the causes of changes in its growth rates and variability over the past three decades. We use a well-validated chemistry\u2013transport model for simulating CH 4 concentration and estimation of regional CH 4 emissions by inverse modeling during 1988\u20132016. The control simulations are conducted using seasonally varying hydroxyl (OH) concentrations and assumed no interannual variability. Using inverse modeling of atmospheric observations, emission inventories, a wetland model, and a \u03b4 13 C-CH 4 box model, we show that reductions in emissions from Europe and Russia since 1988, particularly from oil\u2013gas exploitation and enteric fermentation, led to decreased CH 4 growth rates in the 1990s. This period was followed by a quasi-stationary state of CH 4 in the atmosphere during the early 2000s. CH 4 resumed growth from 2007, which we attribute to increases in emissions from coal mining mainly in China and the intensification of ruminant farming in tropical regions. A sensitivity simulation using interannually varying OH shows that regional emission estimates by inversion are unaffected for the mid-and high latitude areas. We show that meridional shift in CH 4 emissions toward the lower latitudes and the increase in CH 4 loss by hydroxyl (OH) over the tropics finely balance out, keeping the CH 4 gradients between the southern hemispheric tropical and polar sites relatively unchanged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:BAanoTsO0WEC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4510558487646560838", "cites_id": ["4510558487646560838"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/99/2/99_2021-015/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RuLL6gu5mD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 11, "2022": 17, "2023": 6}}
