Paradoxically, our understanding of local dispersal processes has, during the five years that separated the two workshops, benefited from theoretical and empirical advances motivated by long-distance dispersal issues. Recent findings suggest that landscape structure, rather than dispersal potential, might be the key to understanding past and future migrations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=567048256769502846", "cites_id": ["567048256769502846"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(01)02337-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fi5Am2KP3gcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
