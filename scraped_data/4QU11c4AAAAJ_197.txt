They are contributing their respective Earth monitoring systems to GEOSS and interlinking these systems so that they work together better. They are developing common technical standards to make it possible to pool information, and they are promoting the free sharing and dissemination of Earth observations and data. This expanding coalition of countries and organizations has already transformed the ability of governments to manage natural resources and promote the safety and well-being of their citizens.GEO plans to produce globally harmonized data sets on global, national and local scales, using common algorithms, variables and units; as well as, to develop an integrated model that stitches all carbon observations together. The IGOS-P, through their leadership and implementation plans have now been fully integrated into GEO and are the foundation for the Communities of Practice. The new GEO Carbon Community of Practice will implement a plan for an Integrated Carbon Observation program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14980847572863751137", "cites_id": ["14980847572863751137"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-03228889/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4RPR3n6p5s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
