The constrained GPP and TER fluxes show an increasing trend of only half of the prior trend simulated by models. From the optimization, we infer that TER increased in parallel with GPP from 1980 to 1990, but then stalled during the cooler periods, in 1990\u20131994 coincident with the Pinatubo eruption, and during the recent warming hiatus period. After each of these TER stalling periods, TER is found to increase faster than GPP, explaining a relative reduction of the net land sink. These results shed light on decadal variations of GPP and TER and suggest that they exhibit different responses to temperature anomalies over the last 35 years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14275179584767961888", "cites_id": ["14275179584767961888"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL076622", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IKsA_zKgG8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
