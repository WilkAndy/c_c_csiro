During the past decade, however, emissions from fossil fuel use and cement production have remained high. Emissions in recent years have been fairly stable at\u223c 10 Pg C yr\u2212 1 but are still 60% greater than in 1990 (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al 2016, Jackson et al 2016). Climate stabilization temperature depends on the cumulative emissions since the beginning of the fossil era some two centuries ago. As a way to reconcile current emission trends with the small carbon budgets compatible with 1.5\u25e6 C and 2\u25e6 C average increases in global temperature, one option invoked in integrated assessment models (IAMs) and, increasingly, in policy circles is negative emissions (NEs)(eg Royal Society 2009, Tavoni and Socolow 2013, McLaren 2013, NRC 2015, Smith et al 2016). A NE technology results in the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (also sometimes referred to as carbon dioxide removal, CDR). Examples of the most commonly proposed negative emission technologies (NETs) include biomass energy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), afforestation, and industrial direct air capture (DAC).Current 1.5\u25e6 C scenarios all feature rapid deployment of NETs, and most scenarios limiting global warming to 2\u25e6 C rely on NETs, as well (Rogelj et al 2015). Relatively little is known, however, about the global potential of emerging and future NETs, the sustainability and cost of large-scale deployment needed to meet \u2018safe\u2019climate stabilization targets \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1799989799011788520", "cites_id": ["1799989799011788520"], "pub_url": "https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/14958/1/Jackson_2017_Environ._Res._Lett._12_110201.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6KZseS_Z-hgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
