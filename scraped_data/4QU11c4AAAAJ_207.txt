Here, we provide a daily CO2 emissions dataset for the whole year of 2020, calculated from inventory and near-real-time activity data. We find a global reduction of 6.3% (2,232\u2009MtCO2) in CO2 emissions compared with 2019. The drop in daily emissions during the first part of the year resulted from reduced global economic activity due to the pandemic lockdowns, including a large decrease in emissions from the transportation sector. However, daily CO2 emissions gradually recovered towards 2019 levels from late April with the partial reopening of economic activity. Subsequent waves of lockdowns in late 2020 continued to cause smaller CO2 reductions, primarily in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:nWoA1JPTheMC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8654005383338543668", "cites_id": ["8654005383338543668"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00965-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NEo2lgs0GXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 8, "2023": 16}}
