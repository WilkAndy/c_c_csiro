The solid black line in both panels shows FF+ LUC emission inventory data2, 8, with indicative uncertainty of one standard deviation (\u00b19%; dashed black line). The upper panel applies the method of Francey et al. 1, comparing the data with estimates from atmospheric concentrations derived by displacing dC/dt\u2212 IAV by 5.3 Pg C yr\u2212 1; red and blue lines use dC/dt\u2212 IAV from Francey et al. 1 (available for 1990\u20132011) and from a longer series12, 8, respectively. The lower panel compares emissions data with AF-based estimates from atmospheric concentrations, using the same series for dC/dt\u2212 IAV as the upper panel (red and blue lines). Also shown is an emissions estimate derived by adding model-based estimates8 of land and ocean CO2 sinks to observed dC/dt (green line)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17889215195188534184", "cites_id": ["17889215195188534184"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1910", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qJu7W3BCQ_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
