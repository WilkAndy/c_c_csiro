An upscaling from single systems to landscapes and continents is an additional essential component of global change research. In contrast to the well-estab lished research methodology in the ecophysiology of species (see Pearcy et al., 1989), the approaches to studying ecosystems as a whole, and the theory required to identify key parameters that drive the multiple interactions at the ecosystem level, are less developed (see Schulze, 1995a). The available tools become even more limited for the study of responses at geographically broader scales. One of IG B P\u2019s (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme) products has been the contribution to methodology and theory for extrapola tions from ecosystems to continental scales. Experimental investigations of ecosystems started between i 960 and 1970 with the International Biological Programme (IBP), and the ecosystem-level global change studies of GCTE (Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems) have built strongly on that heritage. Global change research has reiterated that ecosystems are difficult to study for several reasons:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14842156401275539013", "cites_id": ["14842156401275539013"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276284954.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RY7RHpzu-c0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
