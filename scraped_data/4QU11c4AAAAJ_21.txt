Although the uptake of carbon by oceanic and terrestrial processes has kept pace with accelerating carbon dioxide emissions until now, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations exhibit a large variability on interannual timescales, considered to be driven primarily by terrestrial ecosystem processes dominated by tropical rainforests. We use a terrestrial biogeochemical model, atmospheric carbon dioxide inversion and global carbon budget accounting methods to investigate the evolution of the terrestrial carbon sink over the past 30 years, with a focus on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the exceptionally large land carbon sink reported in 2011 (ref. ). Here we show that our three terrestrial carbon sink estimates are in good agreement and support the finding of a 2011 record \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 1115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6745136335456618562", "cites_id": ["6745136335456618562"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13376", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qsh4hMKJm10J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 12, "2015": 72, "2016": 113, "2017": 125, "2018": 138, "2019": 136, "2020": 149, "2021": 148, "2022": 156, "2023": 65}}
