Each of these provides a piece of the carbon-balance puzzle, but there is no single tool or approach that gives the total spatial and temporal resolution that is needed to understand global and regional carbon dynamics, and the control of those fluxes.As we prepare for an implementation phase of the Kyoto Protocol, agreed by the Parties of the Framework Convention for Climate Change to stabilize the concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2), nations will need precise information on the variability of background levels of carbon exchange in their biotic systems, and on how humans are modifying these exchanges. In addition, the high economic value of the terrestrial carbon sink, and its associated uncertainties, places a high priority on understanding current and future controls of the carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13215061641669020823", "cites_id": ["13215061641669020823"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(99)01601-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l4yS9ItUZbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
