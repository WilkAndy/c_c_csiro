Through analyzing the OH fields simulated by the model ensemble of the Chemistry\u2013Climate Model Initiative (CCMI), we find (1) the negative OH anomalies during the El Ni\u00f1o years mainly corresponding to the enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from biomass burning and (2) a positive OH trend during 1980\u20132010 dominated by the elevated primary production and the reduced loss of OH due to decreasing CO after 2000. Both two-box model inversions and variational 4D inversions suggest that ignoring the negative anomaly of OH during the El Ni\u00f1o years leads to a large overestimation of the increase in global CH4 emissions by up to 10\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 to match the observed CH4 increase over these years. Not accounting for the increasing OH trends given by the CCMI models leads to an underestimation of the CH4 emission increase by 23\u2009\u00b1\u20099\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 from 1986 to 2010. The variational-inversion-estimated CH4 emissions show that the tropical regions contribute most to the uncertainties related to OH. This study highlights the significant impact of climate and chemical feedbacks related to OH on the top-down estimates of the global CH4 budget."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12528533745958985663", "cites_id": ["12528533745958985663"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-308/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vx9hHBBL3q0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
