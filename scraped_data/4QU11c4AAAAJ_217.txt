An initial driver over which humans have control (emissions) leads through intermediate responses (concentrations, temperatures and other climate changes) to a final response (climate impacts). To set goals for limiting climate change to acceptable levels, the basic principle is to work backwards through the causal chain. The first requirement is a quantification of\" dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\"(UNFCCC 1992). This determines a threshold beyond which climate impacts are unacceptable, from which science can infer the associated threshold for physical climate change, then the corresponding greenhouse gas concentration threshold, and finally the emissions targets needed to keep the risk of\" dangerous\" outcomes below\" unacceptable\" levels (quotes denote value judgements).Life is not so simple in practice. The first complication is connectivity: the real world is much more complex than a linear causal chain (PMSEIC 2010). Climate and human societies exist in a network of myriad interconnections, so actions at one point (for example, policies to reduce emissions or a decision not to reduce emissions) create ripple effects with consequences far broader than the intended outcome of the action along \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8429380797554992414", "cites_id": ["8429380797554992414"], "pub_url": "https://cawcr.gov.au/technical-reports/CTR_042.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HqXDsiwt-3QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2}}
