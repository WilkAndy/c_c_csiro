Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-cover change data and bookkeeping models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \u00b11\u03c3. For the last decade available (2007\u20132016), EFF was 9.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, ELUC 1.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, GATM 4.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, SOCEAN 2.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, and SLAND 3.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.6\u202fGtC\u202fyr\u22121 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks.
