California\u2019s record fire year of 2020 and high-intensity fires caused unusual mortality among giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum), raising questions about the preservation of these ancient organisms. Likewise, diverse and unconnected terrestrial and marine ecosystems in Australia experienced simultaneous and abrupt collapse in response to the strong El Ni\u00f1o in 2015\u20132016, on top of long-term warming trends. Those changes triggered the question as to whether we were seeing predicted future climate impacts now with the rapid transformation and loss of ecosystems as we know them.In this volume, we, and the contributing authors, document cases of ecosystem collapse around the world. In each case, the authors believe that climate change is playing a dominant or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:as0KMg8qHbkC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12172510350007593281", "cites_id": ["12172510350007593281"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-71330-0.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qen3rKtx7agJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
