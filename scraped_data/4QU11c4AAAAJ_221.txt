The cropland practices of fertilizer substitution, crop straw and conservation tillage are beneficial and help to rebuild local soil carbon stocks and reduce soil carbon emissions, in addition to reducing the consumption of fertilizers and fossil fuels. These improved cropland practices can directly and indirectly mitigate carbon emissions, benefiting the sustainability of croplands. For these three improved practices, we estimated carbon mitigation potentials in rice, wheat and maize croplands in China. The combined contribution of these practices to carbon mitigation was 38.8 Tg C yr-1, with fertilizer substitution, crop straw return, and conservation tillage contributing 26.6, 3.6 and 8.6 Tg C yr-1, respectively. Rice, wheat and maize croplands had potentials to mitigate 13.4, 11.9 and 15.5 Tg C yr-1, respectively, with the combined direct and indirect potential of 33.8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12611862868171053544", "cites_id": ["12611862868171053544"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11629-015-3813-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6FlGRXVWBq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
