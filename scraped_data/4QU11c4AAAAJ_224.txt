In the fire-affected forest areas, understory and often tree canopies were burned, and in-situ observations in late 2020 reported rapid vegetation recovery, including grasses, shrubs, and tree canopies from burned-but-not-dead eucalyptus trees. Considering the strong fire resilience and resistance of eucalyptus trees and above-average rainfall in 2020, we assessed how much and how quickly vegetation structure and biomass changed from loss to post-fire and drought recovery in 2020 for all forest areas in Australia. Here, we analyzed space-borne optical, thermal, and microwave images to assess changes in the structure and function of vegetation using four vegetation indices (VIs), leaf area index (LAI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), gross primary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9809175002337408359", "cites_id": ["9809175002337408359"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722002012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z3X2gbEwIYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 7}}
