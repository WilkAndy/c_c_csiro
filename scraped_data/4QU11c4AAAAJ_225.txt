Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the temporal variations in CH4 growth, and attribute the rise of atmospheric CH4 either to increases in emissions from fossil fuel activities, agriculture and natural wetlands, or to a decrease in the atmospheric chemical sink. Here, we use a comprehensive ensemble of CH4 source estimates and isotopic \u03b413C-CH4 source signature data to show that the resumption of CH4 growth is most likely due to increased anthropogenic emissions. Our emission scenarios that have the fewest biases with respect to isotopic composition suggest that the agriculture, landfill and waste sectors were responsible for 53 \u00b1 13% of the renewed growth over the period 2007\u20132017 compared to 2000\u20132006; industrial fossil fuel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:rqnDXT1GswoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12388375181710918410", "cites_id": ["12388375181710918410"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-abstract/9/5/nwab200/6425695", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CgMlYpdZ7KsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
