Yet there is limited data on energy consumption patterns and their evolution in forest rural areas of China. In order to bridge this gap, we report the findings of field surveys in forest villages in Weichang County as a case study of rural energy consumption in northern China. We found that the residential energy consumption per household is 3313 kgce yr\u22121 (kilogram standard coal equivalent per year), with energy content of 9.7 \u00d7 107 kJ yr\u22121, including 1783 kgce yr\u22121 from coal, 1386 kgce yr\u22121 from fuel wood, 96 kgce yr\u22121 from electricity, and 49 kgce yr\u22121 from LPG. Per capita consumption is 909 kgce yr\u22121 and its energy content is 2.7 \u00d7 107 kJ yr\u22121. Due to a total energy utilization efficiency of 24.6%, all the consumed energy can only supply about 2.4 \u00d7 107 kJ yr \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1362380886075709442", "cites_id": ["1362380886075709442"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11629-013-2884-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AhhTmzIm6BIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
