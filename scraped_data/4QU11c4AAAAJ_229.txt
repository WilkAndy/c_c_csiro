This large C pool, in addition to C in Arctic soils, lies at higher latitudes that are experiencing ongoing climate change. Tropical peatlands also contain large C reservoirs, the stability of which is threatened by ongoing land use change. In response to a call from PeatNet (a National Science Foundation\u2010supported research coordination network), Juul Limpens and Gabriela Schaepman\u2010Strub proposed a small workshop on peatland C cycling, an idea that morphed into a meeting with 180 participants from 18 countries,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9007288434825172314", "cites_id": ["9007288434825172314"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007EO290005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WhU92xtRAH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
