The Global Carbon Project: Canberra, 2007", "author": "Liese Coulter and Pep Canadell and Shobhakar Dhakal", "journal": "A GCP report for the ESSP. The Global Carbon Project: Canberra", "abstract": "A growing awareness about climate change by individuals, institutions and businesses has generated demand for CO2 reductions for specific activities or for offsetting their full carbon footprints. Decisions to adopt such a practice are driven by business profit, environmental commitment, civil responsibility and leadership. The recently established voluntary carbon market is gaining momentum as growth in the demand for CO2 reductions is outpacing the wider introduction of low-carbon technologies in transport, energy production and manufacturingWhile there are concerns related to the voluntary and unregulated nature of this market, new robust standards, reporting and verification along with broad project implementation are raising confidence in the system. The impact of voluntary carbon offsets will increase as the economic analysis of the carbon market gains a wider acceptance and more speculative investors support it."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=703636477160566189", "cites_id": ["703636477160566189"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liese-Coulter/publication/237459128_A_GCP_report_for_the_ESSP/links/00b7d528eacd616a88000000/A-GCP-report-for-the-ESSP.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ra0p4KXRwwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
