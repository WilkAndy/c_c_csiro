The focus of the new project includes people, biota, and other natural resources (air, water, and soil). The strategy presented here critically emphasizes changes in the coupled human and environmental system, which is an extension of the ecosystem concept to explicitly include human actions and decision-making. The research planning builds upon the extensive heritage of global change research \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16557150687530547216", "cites_id": ["16557150687530547216"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-32730-1_25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EHjfptPQxuUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
