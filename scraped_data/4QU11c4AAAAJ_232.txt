Even in areas without large agricultural populations, humans used fire to modify vegetation. The spread of Europeans and their land use practices in the last several hundred years significantly impacted the landscapes around the world, as concurrent population increases and population movements (due to colonization and the slave trade) brought much more of the world under human management. Human impacts accelerated with the coming of the industrial revolution, but were significant in many parts of the world prior to the 1800s. These land use and land cover changes affected many aspects of the Earth surface-atmosphere system, including the carbon budget, ecosystems, and hydrology. However, these factors are poorly understood within the current IGBP framework. PAGES has focused on long-term climatic changes and their associated impacts, whereas LUCC has focused largely on landscape impacts of human activities during the last few decades. To address this shortfall, PAGES and LUCC, in collaboration with GAIM have initiated BIOME 300, a joint effort to reconstruct global patterns of land use and associated land cover changes since AD 1700. This work will involve a unique intersection of the interests and skills of archaeologists, historians, economists, demographers, ecologists, paleoecologists, palynologists, as well as ecological, climatic, and carbon-cycle modelers.
