An understanding of the natural carbon exchange over the land and oceans due to tropical climate variability is also required for calculating interannual to interdecadal variations in atmospheric CO2 (Patra et al., 2005).An international workshop was organized through financial supports from (1) the Asia Pacific Network (APN) funded project (ARCP2011-11NMY-Patra/Canadell), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Geosphere-Biosphere Project (GBP)(ATCTM) at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad. The main aim of this 1 st APN workshop was to assess resources available currently among the international research community working on various aspects of earth system sciences with a focus on South and Southeast Asia. The key issue discussed was the availability of data and models to work towards the establishment of the GHG budget for these two regions based on synthesis and reconciliation of top-down (atmospheric observations and inverse models) and bottom up estimates (ground based flux observations and terrestrial models). These included atmospheric measurements of GHGs, classifications of land cover and soil properties, coastal ocean biogeochemistry, forest and agriculture inventories, and remote sensing based estimates. The target GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxides (N2O)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11377577198690204238", "cites_id": ["11377577198690204238"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9ebb6c8e8a552c649ffc1e6fec5a1522c546ec36", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TnqDZC5G5Z0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
