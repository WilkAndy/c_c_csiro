Over the past decades, forcing by direct and indirect human activities has reached a point that is now rivaling the natural forcing that has shaped the Earth system over millennia. This unprecedented phenomenon has attracted a major investment by the scientific community to detect the impacts, attribute the changes to processes, and explore future trajectories. This scientific information is fundamental to creating the knowledge base that will inform policy development and will allow human societies to mitigate and adapt to these rapid changes.With the goal of developing a novel research agenda in support to the above objectives, the \u2018\u2018Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems\u2019\u2019core project (GCTE, Walker et al. 1999; Canadell et al. 2005) was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16274614690802426636", "cites_id": ["16274614690802426636"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11284-005-0040-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DOOhrdUL2-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
