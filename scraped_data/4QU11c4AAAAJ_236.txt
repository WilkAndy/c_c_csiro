Before major human intervention, the carbon cycle was driven by climate variability and the internal dynamics of the linked land-ocean-atmosphere system (Figure 1). However, from about 200 years ago, industrialisation and accelerating land-use change increased the complexity of the carbon cycle by adding a new stock\u2013fossil fuel. Although society was aware of the changes, it has not been until the last two decades that humans have begun to realise that changes in climate change and variability (through changes in the carbon cycle and other greenhouse gases) may significantly affect their welfare as well as the functioning of the Earth System. Now the development and implementation of institutions and regimes to manage the global carbon cycle adds a new set of feedbacks in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5219497408194526141", "cites_id": ["5219497408194526141"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5219497408194526141&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vbuBGT1hb0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
