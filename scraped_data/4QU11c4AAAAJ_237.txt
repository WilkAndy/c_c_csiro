Quantifying the spatial and temporal variations of these emissions is crucial for climate change mitigation. Although country\u2010level information is reported regularly through national inventories and global databases, spatially explicit quantification of century\u2010long dynamics of CH4 emissions from livestock has been poorly investigated. Using the Tier 2 method adopted from the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines, we estimated CH4 emissions from global livestock at a spatial resolution of 0.083\u00b0 (~9 km at the equator) during the period 1890\u20132019. We find that global CH4 emissions from livestock increased from 31.8 [26.5\u201337.1] (mean [minimum\u2212maximum of 95% confidence interval) Tg CH4 yr\u22121 in 1890 to 131.7 [109.6\u2013153.7] Tg CH4 yr\u22121 in 2019, a fourfold increase in the past 130\u2009years.
