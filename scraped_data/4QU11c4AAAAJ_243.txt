This document synthesises the key points that emerged from the findings. Our review focuses on papers published since the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), with its cut-off date of March 2013. The papers can be viewed on sciencebrief.org/topics/climate-change-science/wildfires. All papers show linkages between climate change and increased frequency or severity of fire weather, though some note anomalies in isolated regions. None of the papers support a widespread decrease in fire risk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:J3LtWjKFLicC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16361746077685455617", "cites_id": ["16361746077685455617"], "pub_url": "https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/77982/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ARuVkV6ZEOMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7}}
