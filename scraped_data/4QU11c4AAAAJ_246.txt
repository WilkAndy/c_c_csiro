There is also anecdotal evidence that pyrocumulonimbus events have become more common, although the observed record is short. We explore the extent to which possible changes in fire and pyrocumulonimbus occurrence in southeast Australia can be explained by changes in the number of extreme (above the 95th percentile) days per year of two fire-weather indices, the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and the continuous Haines index (C-Haines). For the period 1958 through 2020, we show that there is a dependence between the number of extreme FFDI days per year and burned area for forested parts of southeast Australia. To a lesser extent, there is a relationship between the FFDI and pyrocumulonimbus occurrences. We find an increase in the occurrence of extreme FFDI days from the late 1990s \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15465804070912526248", "cites_id": ["15465804070912526248"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094721000840", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qAeIdNySodYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
