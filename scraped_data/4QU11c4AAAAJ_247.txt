Diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems have experienced collapse-like dynamics throughout the world, particularly over the past decade. This book addresses the over-arching question: \u201cAre we seeing predicted \u201cfuture\u201d climate impacts now, with the rapid transformation and loss of ecosystems as we know them?\u201dIn each case of ecosystem collapse documented here, the authors believe that climate change is playing a dominant or contributing role to the ecosystem\u2019s apparent demise, often interacting with other pressures. The book covers three latitudinal regions: (1) polar and boreal ecosystems, such as the impacts of water stress with a novel pathogen on alpine vegetation mosaics in Antarctic Macquarie Island, forest transitions to shrublands and grasslands \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:M_lZXyI38BkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6110026117493713937", "cites_id": ["6110026117493713937"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-71330-0_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EWySrWEsy1QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
