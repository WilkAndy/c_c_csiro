We describe critical new developments that extend the applicability of CABLE for regional and global carbon-climate simulations, accounting for vegetation response to biophysical and anthropogenic forcings. A land-use and land-cover change module, driven by gross land-use transitions and wood harvest area was implemented, tailored to the needs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6). Novel aspects include the treatment of secondary woody vegetation, which benefits from a tight coupling between the land-use module and the Population Orders Physiology (POP) module for woody demography and disturbance-mediated landscape heterogeneity. Land-use transitions and harvest associated with secondary forest tiles modify the annually-resolved patch age distribution within secondary-vegetated tiles, in turn affecting biomass accumulation and turnover rates and hence the magnitude of the secondary forest sink. Additionally, we implemented a novel approach to constrain modelled GPP consistent with the Co-ordination Hypothesis, predicted by evolutionary theory, which suggests that electron transport and Rubisco-limited rates adjust seasonally and across biomes to be co-limiting. We show that the default prior assumption - common to CABLE and other LSMs - of a fixed ratio of electron transport to carboxylation capacity is at odds with this hypothesis, and implement an alternative algorithm for dynamic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11662754650277900186", "cites_id": ["11662754650277900186"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mm9ZAJBt2qEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
