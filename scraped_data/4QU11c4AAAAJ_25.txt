Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 continue to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative importance of CH4 compared to CO2 depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). For the 2008\u20132017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 (range 550\u2013594 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WwIwg2wKZ0QC", "num_citations": 1047, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10360619151030514492", "cites_id": ["10360619151030514492"], "pub_url": "https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1561/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PHNIljlQyI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 65, "2021": 323, "2022": 442, "2023": 206}}
