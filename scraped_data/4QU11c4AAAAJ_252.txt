Thisunprecedented increase is linked to human activities including fossil fuel combustion anddeforestation. The increase in CO_2 concentrations, and to a lesser extent in other greenhouse gases, is linked to changes in climate patterns and variability, and to an average global warming of 0.6\u2103 during the 20th Century (IPCC 2001). Changes in land use and cover are critical controls of the distribution and strength of carbon"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7319218549634961314", "cites_id": ["7319218549634961314"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7319218549634961314&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:og9x9H0Wk2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
