As a precursor to ESSP (and before DIVERSITAS was re-launched in 2001), IGBP, \nIHDP and WCRP had already been collaborating more closely by co-sponsoring the design \nof a number of \u201cJoint Projects\u201d. These were envisioned as new initiatives aimed at helping \nto frame and develop innovative, interdisciplinary research that addressed issues of interest \nnot only to science but also to society at large.
