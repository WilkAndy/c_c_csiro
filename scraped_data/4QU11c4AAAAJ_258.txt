These global changes have been well-documented (eg, Vitousek et al. 1997; Mooney and Canadell 2001; Steffen et al. 2004). They include changes in the composition of the atmosphere, including increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases; changes in global and regional climate; habitat destruction and land cover change; increases in the amounts of reactive nitrogen compounds in the biosphere; increases in species extinction rates; and increases in the number and impacts of exotic invasive species. The extent and magnitude of human-caused changes has led Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen (2002) to propose that the Earth has entered a new geologic era, the Anthropocene\u2013an era of human domination of the Earth System, in contrast to the previous billions of years of Earth\u2019s history when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10678584169709782879", "cites_id": ["10678584169709782879"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-32730-1_1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X0epi7nzMZQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
