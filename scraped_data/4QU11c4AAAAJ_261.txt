However, we are concerned about the report's last statement (also appearing in the abstract), which extrapolates measurements of net primary production (NPP) from this one experiment to the world's forests as a whole, suggesting that they could absorb as much as 50% of the projected fossil fuel emissions of [CO. sub. 2] in 2050. This projection gives a misleading, perhaps erroneous, picture of the role of the terrestrial biosphere in the global carbon cycle.First, NPP is not the appropriate measurement to apply when considering the net uptake (or release) of [CO. sub. 2] by the terrestrial biosphere on a biome or larger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10527761002214578485", "cites_id": ["10527761002214578485"], "pub_url": "https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA55940186&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00368075&p=AONE&sw=w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ndk1YdoeGpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3}}
