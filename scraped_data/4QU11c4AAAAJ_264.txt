The level of uncertainty in net LUC flux from process\u2010based models is so high that it cannot be concluded that newer estimates are necessarily more reliable than older ones. Here, we examined net LUC flux estimates of Southeast Asia for the 1980s\u22122010s from older and newer sets of Dynamic Global Vegetation Model simulations (TRENDY v2 and v7, respectively), and forcing data used for running those simulations, along with two book\u2010keeping estimates (H&N and BLUE). These estimates yielded two contrasting historical LUC transitions, such that TRENDY v2 and H&N showed a transition from increased emissions from the 1980s to 1990s to declining emissions in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5490957379085753438", "cites_id": ["5490957379085753438"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GB006909", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xlw32aTMM0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
