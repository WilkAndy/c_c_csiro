The BU\u2010based total emission shows a slight increase owing to U.S. agriculture, while no consistent trend is shown in TD estimates. During 2007\u20132016, North American N2O emissions are estimated at 1.7 (1.0\u20133.0) Tg N yr\u22121 (BU) and 1.3 (0.9\u20131.5) Tg N yr\u22121 (TD). Anthropogenic emissions were twice as large as natural fluxes from soil and water. Direct agricultural and industrial activities accounted for 68% of total anthropogenic emissions, 71% of which was contributed by the U.S. Our estimates of U.S. agricultural emissions are comparable to the EPA greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, which includes estimates from IPCC tier 1 (emission factor) and tier 3 (process\u2010based modeling) approaches. Conversely, our estimated agricultural emissions for Canada \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5048485106020025883", "cites_id": ["5048485106020025883"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL095264", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G4YstnTSD0YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
