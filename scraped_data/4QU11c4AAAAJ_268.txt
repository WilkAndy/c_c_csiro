Understanding of this uptake is critical because it greatly alleviates the emissions reductions required for climate mitigation. An observable quantity that re-5 flects sink properties more directly than the AF is the CO2 sink rate (kS), the combined land-ocean CO2 sink flux per unit excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial levels. Here we show from observations that kS declined over 1959\u20132012 by a factor of about 1/3, implying that CO2 sinks increased more slowly than excess CO2. We attribute the decline in kS to four mechanisms: slower-than-exponential CO2 emissions growth 10 (\u223c 35% of the trend), volcanic eruptions (\u223c 25%), sink responses to climate change (\u223c 20%), and nonlinear responses to increasing CO2, mainly oceanic (\u223c 20%). The first of these mechanisms is associated purely with extrinsic forcings, and the last two with intrinsic, nonlinear responses of sink processes to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2. Our results indicate that the effects of these intrinsic, nonlinear responses 15 are already detectable in the global carbon cycle. Although continuing future decreases in kS will occur under all plausible CO2 emission scenarios, the rate of decline varies between scenarios in non-intuitive ways because extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms respond in opposite ways to changes in emissions: extrinsic mechanisms cause kS to decline more strongly with increasing mitigation, while intrinsic mechanisms cause kS 20 to decline more strongly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11662371669250475297", "cites_id": ["11662371669250475297"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/10/18407/2013/bgd-10-18407-2013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IQVBSD4R2aEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
