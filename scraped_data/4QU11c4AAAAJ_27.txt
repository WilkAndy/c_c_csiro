The impact of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis (GFC) on emissions has been short-lived owing to strong emissions growth in emerging economies, a return to emissions growth in developed economies, and an increase in the fossil-fuel intensity of the world economy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 1023, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5734014515510846872", "cites_id": ["5734014515510846872"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1332", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mCX1XdJPk08J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 90, "2013": 141, "2014": 116, "2015": 99, "2016": 81, "2017": 74, "2018": 68, "2019": 56, "2020": 112, "2021": 83, "2022": 65, "2023": 23}}
