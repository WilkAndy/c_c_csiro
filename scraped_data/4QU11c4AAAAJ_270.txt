Arctic terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle, making large contributions to fluxes of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. Both outflows of carbon from and inflows of carbon to Arctic terrestrial ecosystems have been altered as climate has warmed. As warming continues in the future, carbon emissions from Arctic lands are projected to outpace uptake, further adding to global warming."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5559326745875880288", "cites_id": ["5559326745875880288"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/48854217/WWFBinaryitem13652.pdf#page=69", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YJlChjiyJk0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2}}
