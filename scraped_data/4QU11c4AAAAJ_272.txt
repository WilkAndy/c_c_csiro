Instead, countries frequently combine natural and indirect human-induced CO2 fluxes on managed land in their reports, which diminishes their usefulness for designing policies consistent with climate mitigation targets. Here, we separate natural and land-use-related CO2 fluxes from national reports in eight countries using global models to improve the assessment of attribution of terrestrial CO2 fluxes to direct anthropogenic activities. In most investigated countries, the gap between model-based and report-based CO2 flux estimates is reduced if natural and indirect human-induced CO2 fluxes on managed land are considered. Further examinations show that remaining differences are linked to country-specific discrepancies between model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ojlX30-wUrgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15405790074448407696", "cites_id": ["15405790074448407696"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332222005851", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kGy8B3NczNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
