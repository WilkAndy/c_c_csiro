Here we provide a dataset on anthropogenic GHG emissions 1970\u20132019 with a broad country and sector coverage. We build the dataset from recent releases of the \u201cEmissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research\u201d (EDGAR) for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industry (FFI), CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, and fluorinated gases, and use a well-established fast-track method to extend this dataset from 2018 to 2019. We complement this with data on net CO2 emissions from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) from three bookkeeping models. We provide an assessment of the uncertainties in each greenhouse gas at the 90\u2009% confidence interval (5th\u201395th \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3507287409260159662", "cites_id": ["3507287409260159662"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3507287409260159662&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ruIm-lBjrDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
