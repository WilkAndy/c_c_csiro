Haverd et al.(Biogeosciences, 10, 851\u2013869, 2013) the following error occurred: we counted C-CO2 emissions from clearing fires and from land use change (LUC) as independent fluxes in the Australian C budget. This was incorrect because the LUC emissions also include clearing fire emissions, leading to a double counting in the net carbon balance. We have now excluded clearing fire emissions (23 Tg C yr\u2212 1) from the net fire emissions term and from the net fluxes and changes in stock in Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2. This results in a new estimate of net biospheric production of 59\u00b135 Tg C yr\u2212 1, which is significantly higher than the original estimate of 36\u00b135 Tg C yr\u2212 1. These changes require revisions to Table 1, Figs. 1 and 2 and to the second key finding in the Summary (Sect. 6) as follows:Net ecosystem productivity is partially offset by LUC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2766482512186500415", "cites_id": ["2766482512186500415"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/12/3603/2015/bg-12-3603-2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P-U0-C-FZCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
