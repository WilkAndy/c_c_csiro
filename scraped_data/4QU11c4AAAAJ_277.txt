The work is a contribution to the RECCAP (REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes) project, as one of numerous regional studies being synthesised in RECCAP. 5 In constructing the budget, we estimate the following component carbon fluxes: Net Primary Production (NPP); Net Ecosystem Production (NEP); fire; Land Use Change (LUC); riverine export; dust export; harvest (wood, crop and livestock) and fossil fuel emissions (both territorial and non-territorial). The mean NEP reveals that climate variability and rising CO2 contributed 12\u00b129 10 (1\u03c3 error on mean) and 68\u00b135 Tg C yr\u2212 1 respectively. However these gains were partially offset by fire and LUC (along with other minor fluxes), which caused net losses of 31\u00b15 Tg C yr\u2212 1 and 18\u00b17 Tg C yr\u2212 1 respectively. The resultant Net Biome Production (NBP) of 31\u00b135 Tg C yr\u2212 1 offset fossil fuel emissions (95\u00b16 Tg C yr\u2212 1) by 32\u00b136%. The interannual variability (IAV) in the Australian carbon budget exceeds Australia\u2019s 15 total carbon emissions by fossil fuel combustion and is dominated by IAV in NEP. Territorial fossil fuel emissions are significantly smaller than the rapidly growing fossil fuel exports: in 2009\u20132010, Australia exported 2.5 times more carbon in fossil fuels than it emitted by burning fossil fuels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:orDZ08hpP44C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4002100763156799376", "cites_id": ["4002100763156799376"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/9/12259/2012/bgd-9-12259-2012.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kN9Hp3BRijcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
