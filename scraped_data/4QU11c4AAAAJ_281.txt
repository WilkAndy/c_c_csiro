Earth and Environmental Science", "volume": "6", "number": "8", "publisher": "IOP Publishing", "abstract": "The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is the single largest human perturbation of the climate system. Its rate of change reflects the balance between human-driven carbon emissions and the dynamics of a number of terrestrial and ocean processes that remove or emit CO2. It is the long term evolution of this balance that will determine to large extent the speed and magnitude of climate change and the mitigation requirements to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations at any given level. In this talk, we\u2019ll present the most recent trends in global carbon sources and sinks, updated to 2007, with particularly focus on major shifts occurring since 2000. Atmospheric CO2 growth: Annual mean growth rate of atmospheric CO2 was 2.2 ppm per year in 2007 (up from 1.8 ppm in 2006), and above the 2.0 ppm average for the period 2000-2007. The average annual mean growth rate for the previous 20 years was about 1.5 ppm per year. This increase brought the atmospheric CO2 concentration to 383 ppm in 2007, 37% above the concentration at the start of the industrial revolution (about 280 ppm in 1750). The present concentration is the highest during the last 650,000 years and probably during the last 20 million years.[ppm= parts per million]. Emissions from land use change: Land use change was responsible for estimated net emissions of 1.5 PgC per year to the atmosphere. This is largely the difference between CO2 emissions from deforestation and CO2 uptake by reforestation. Emissions for 2006 and 2007 were extrapolated from the previous 25-year trend of 1.5 PgC per year. Land use change emissions come almost exclusively from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3792276086961530753", "cites_id": ["3792276086961530753"], "pub_url": "https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Canadell_2009.Global%20carbon%20sources%20and%20sinks_2007%20update.IOP%20Conf.Ser..pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:geeMPQLfoDQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
