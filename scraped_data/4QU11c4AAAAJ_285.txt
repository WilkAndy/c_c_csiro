In particular, there is a great interest in land-use options that enhance carbon sinks and/or reduce emissions from deforestation. Climate mitigation efforts are also becoming more integrated into the larger portfolio of environmental and socio-economic activities geared towards sustainable development. In this respect, management of the terrestrial carbon cycle is even more important because it is fundamentally linked to multiple ecosystem properties and services essential to human wellbeing. To support this effort there is an urgent need to improve process understanding of land carbon sources and sinks, and to develop capabilities that will allow operational monitoring of the dynamic evolution of the carbon cycle.
