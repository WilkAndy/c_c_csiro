The average annual change in the C stock of established forests (Table 1) indicates a large uptake of 2.5\u00b10.4 PgC yr\u20131 for 1990-1999 and a similar uptake of 2.3\u00b10.5 PgC yr\u20131 for 2000-2007. Adding to those the C uptakes in tropical regrowth forests indicates a persistent global gross forest C sink of 4.0\u00b10.7 PgC yr\u20131 over the two periods (Tables 1 and 2). Despite the consistency of the global C sink since 1990, our analysis revealed important regional and temporal differences in sink sizes. The C sink in temperate forests increased by 17% in 2000-2007 compared to 1990-1999, in contrast to C uptake in intact tropical forests that decreased by 23%(but non \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:4aZ_i-5WJEQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10790208161030017755", "cites_id": ["10790208161030017755"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10790208161030017755&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2xK3SieFvpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
