However, how much previously uncut forest has been converted to plantations remains unquantified. We combine Swedish national databases on clear\u2010cuts and forest inventories to show that at least 19% of all clear\u2010cuts since 2003 have occurred in old forests that were most likely not previously cut and planted or seeded. Old forests have been cut and lost at a steady rate of \u223c1.4% per year for the same period, and at this rate they will disappear by the 2070s. There is further evidence that this type of unreported forest conversion is occurring across much of the world's boreal forest."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ShjGdcaqzI0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5328072956613044466", "cites_id": ["5328072956613044466"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022EF003221", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8ihJ7B8e8UkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
