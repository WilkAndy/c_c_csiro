Both fluxes can be altered by wetland management (e.g., restoration), leading to changes in the climate system. Here, we use multiple models to assess CH4 emissions and CO2 sequestration from the wetlands in China and the impacts on climate under three climate scenarios and four wetland management scenarios with various levels of wetland restoration in the 21st century. We find that wetland restoration leads to increased CH4 emissions with a national total of 0.32\u201311.31 Tg yr\u20131. These emissions induce an additional radiative forcing of 0.0005\u20130.0075 W m\u20132 yr\u20131 and global annual mean air temperature rise of 0.0003\u20130.0053 \u00b0C yr\u20131, across all future climate and management scenarios. However, wetland restoration also resulted in net CO2 sequestration, leading to a combined net greenhouse gas sink in all climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:rFyVMFCKTwsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14691489869084542841", "cites_id": ["14691489869084542841"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.2c01575", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eccIdDKo4ssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
