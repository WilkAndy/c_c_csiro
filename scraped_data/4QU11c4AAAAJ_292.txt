Technical summary     We synthesize 10 topics within climate research where there have been significant advances or emerging scientific consensus since January 2021. The selection of these insights was based on input from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings concern: (1) new aspects of soft and hard limits to adaptation; (2) the emergence of regional vulnerability hotspots from climate impacts and human vulnerability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:oYLFIHfuHKwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9158374984007519247", "cites_id": ["9158374984007519247"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-sustainability/article/ten-new-insights-in-climate-science-2022/62C90D59C9F9890791B64762EAA06B8D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D4yXWYYVGX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
