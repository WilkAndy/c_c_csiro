Our activities are increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, nitrogen inputs to ecosystems and global temperatures. Individually and combined, they lead to biospheric availability of carbon and nitrogen, enhanced metabolic activity, and longer growing seasons. Plants can consequently grow more and take up more carbon that can be stored in ecosystem carbon pools, thus enhancing carbon sinks for atmospheric CO2. Data on the increased strength of carbon sinks are, however, inconclusive: Some data (eddy covariance, short-term experiments on elevated CO2 and nutrient fertilization) suggest that biospheric carbon uptake is already effectively increasing but some other data suggest it is not, or are not general and conclusive (tree-ring, forest inventory). The combined land-ocean CO2 sink flux per unit of excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6839121738953092436", "cites_id": ["6839121738953092436"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..18.9724P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VG3zgfxw6V4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
