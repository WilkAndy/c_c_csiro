For comparisons over more than two data points, we calculate the Average Annual Growth Rates as AAGR= d/dt (lnx)= 1/x dx/dt using a linear regression between lnx and t and report the value in%/yr. The use of the logarithm ensures that the growth rates remain additive in the Kaya Identity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13955179147780979778", "cites_id": ["13955179147780979778"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13955179147780979778&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QnxsSH_BqsEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
