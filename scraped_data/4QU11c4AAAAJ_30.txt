Knowing, however, that the mean global temperature will increase by 1.0\u20133.5 C tells us little about how temperatures will change in a particular location or how the ecosystems in that location will respond. For instance, temperature increases are likely to be greater at higher latitudes (Houghton et al. 1995, 1996), where initial conditions are below 0 C most of the year and growing season temperatures are only a few degrees higher. Even a small increase in average temperature at higher latitudes could increase both the length of the unfrozen period and degree-day accumulations by large percentages (Billings 1987). The implications of a given increase in temperature will also depend on the initial temperature at a specific location because the rate of many biological processes in relation to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 847, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=623534676396703280", "cites_id": ["623534676396703280"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/50/10/871/234002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MH7DC3w9pwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 13, "2002": 17, "2003": 26, "2004": 36, "2005": 26, "2006": 22, "2007": 39, "2008": 43, "2009": 41, "2010": 47, "2011": 59, "2012": 40, "2013": 57, "2014": 41, "2015": 42, "2016": 47, "2017": 38, "2018": 38, "2019": 42, "2020": 38, "2021": 40, "2022": 36, "2023": 11}}
