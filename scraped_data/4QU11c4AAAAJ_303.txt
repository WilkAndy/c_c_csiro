The implementation of those commitments and their contributions to reach the Paris Agreement goal of balancing sources and removals of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are dependent on having comprehensive and reliable systems to monitor, report, and verify sources and sinks of GHGs. Both, emission inventories and comprehensive GHG budgets play a key role in characterizing and tracking the human perturbation of global biogeochemical cycles, and assessing the requirements to stabilize the climate system. The chapter covers GHG inventories within the Framework Convention on Climate Change, and shows how the development of comprehensive GHG budgets covering anthropogenic and natural fluxes provides additional and essential information to support climate policy and reach the goals of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Vztgr1qGG8IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10513957120245494852", "cites_id": ["10513957120245494852"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149522000241", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
