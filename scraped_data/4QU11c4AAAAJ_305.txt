With a lifetime around 10 years in the atmosphere and a diversity of emission types, methane is an important target for climate change mitigation. Observations of atmospheric methane began in 1978, and now include a large variety of in-situ and remote-sensed observations from the surface or from space. These data are assimilated in atmospheric inversion to infer methane emissions and sinks (top-down approaches). In parallel, a large international effort is conducted to model emitting processes emitting methane at the surface (eg wetland emissions) or destroying methane in the atmosphere (eg OH radicals), but also to compile inventories of anthropogenic emissions (bottom-up approaches)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:iyewoVqAXLQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15758892406113438267", "cites_id": ["15758892406113438267"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B23D..05S/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Owr-LybVstoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
