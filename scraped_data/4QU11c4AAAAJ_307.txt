Oceanic emissions of N 2 O provide approximately a third of the natural sources to the atmosphere. N 2 O is produced in the ocean during the remineralization of organic matter, and its production and consumption processes display significant sensitivity to local oxygen level. In recent decades, the natural cycle of oceanic N 2 O has been affected by inputs of anthropogenically derived nutrients (via atmospheric deposition and riverine fluxes). The impacts of climate change on the ocean also have implications for marine N 2 O production (eg, via impacts on biological productivity and ocean deoxygenation). The most recent IPCC assessment of the global N 2 O budget (AR5, Ciais et al. 2014) reported a larger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:mel-f30kHHgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=113128020062635838", "cites_id": ["113128020062635838"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B21K2481S/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Pgf6uVXpkQEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
