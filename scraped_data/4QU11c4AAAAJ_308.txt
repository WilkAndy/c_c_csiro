This land carbon flux is the net result of the impact of changing climate and CO2 on ecosystem productivity (CO2-climate driven land sink) and deforestation, harvest and secondary forest regrowth (the land-use change (LUC) flux). The future trajectory of the land carbon flux is highly dependent upon the contributions of these processes to the net flux. However their contributions are highly uncertain, in part because the CO2-climate driven land sink and LUC components are often estimated independently, when in fact they are coupled. We provide a novel assessment of global land carbon fluxes (1800-2015) that integrates land-use effects with the effects of changing climate and CO2 on ecosystem productivity. For this, we use a new land-use enabled Dynamic Global Vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4406606964010480154", "cites_id": ["4406606964010480154"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1913881H/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GnKbwq9pJz0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
