Its rate of change reflects the balance between anthropogenic carbon emissions and the dynamics of a number of terrestrial and ocean processes that remove or emit C02. It is the long term evolution of this balance that will determine to large extent the speed and magnitude of the human induced climate change and the mitigation requirements to stabilise atmospheric C02 concentrations at any given level. In this talk, we show new trends in global carbon sources and sinks, with particularly focus on major shifts occurring since 2000 when the growth rate of atmospheric C02 has reached its highest level on record. The acceleration in the C02 growth results from the combination of several changes in properties of the carbon cycle, including: acceleration of anthropogenic carbon emissions; increased carbon intensity of the global economy, and decreased efficiency of natural carbon sinks. We discuss in more detail some of the possible causes of the reduced efficiency of natural carbon sinks on land and oceans, such as the decreased net sink in the Southern Ocean and on terrestrial mid-latitudes due to world-wide occurrence of drought. All these changes reported here characterise a carbon cycle that is generating stronger than expected climate forcing, and sooner than expected."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10215182565696763553", "cites_id": ["10215182565696763553"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20963652", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oXYe0Guew40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
