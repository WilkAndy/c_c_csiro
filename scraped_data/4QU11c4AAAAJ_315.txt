Without the implementation of policies and measures to slow deforestation, the clearing of tropical forests will likely release an additional 87\u2013130 GtC by 2100 (7), corresponding to the carbon release from more than a decade of global fossil fuel combustion at current rates. Drought-induced tree mortality, logging and fire may double these emissions (8, 9). Despite this, the Kyoto Protocol provides no incentives for reducing emissions from the loss and degradation of tropical forests. In a significant step to address this deficiency, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) recently launched a two-year initiative (10) to assess key technical and scientific issues and \u201cpolicy approaches and positive incentives\u201d for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. If successfully negotiated and implemented, this new \u201cL2\u201d policy process could help to preserve one of the largest terrestrial carbon stocks (428 GtC, or 17.2% of total terrestrial carbon)(6), a potentially important carbon sink (up to c. 2 GtC yr-1, or 25% of total annual anthropogenic emissions)(11), a globally important source of biodiversity (14), and a key resource for the livelihoods of millions of people in forest-rich developing countries (15).Two important kinds of evidence underscore the value and timeliness of the L2 policy process. First, it is increasingly clear that deep emissions reductions will be necessary to avoid \u201cdangerous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16109271459298178838", "cites_id": ["16109271459298178838"], "pub_url": "https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/PolicyForum_Submitted.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FnfOqQqhj98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
