B1 and B2 were independent clones of the same BAC. Positive and negative control templates were genomic DNA and water respectively. The BAC used in our analysis gave a PCR product with th primers only.(c) To generate th: rasGFPsv (shuttle vector), an approximately 1 kb fragment of th promoter (th A-Box) and the Ras membrane anchor tagged mGFP were cloned into the shuttle vector pLD53. SCA-EB, which was subsequently used in the recombination process. Resultant clones were screened using the combinations of primers shown as blue and red arrows (left panel). A second recombination step was not carried out to remove the shuttle vector backbone. Correct clones were further identified by long-range PCR based on combinations of primers 1-3 which revealed six correct clones, of which one was used for data generation (right panel).(d) To reduce possible influences of vector sequences, we engineered th: rasGFPvf (vector-free) using the BAC recombineering strategy by Warming et al. 58. Following the isolation of modified BAC clones from Gal counter selection plates, PCR amplification and sequencing across the respective homology arms were performed to verify the orientation of the transgene (upper panel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:CMvovTBb2okC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5125703898915370194,18137748514123843010,14270027320836053427", "cites_id": ["5125703898915370194", "18137748514123843010", "14270027320836053427"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland-Nitschke/publication/293912815_Supplementary_Figures_Tables_Notes_Methods_and_References/data/5730800208aeb1c73d147bff/ncomms1171-s1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0nSv9okoIkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
