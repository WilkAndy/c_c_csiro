Co-production promises to address the complex nature of contemporary sustainability challenges better than more traditional scientific approaches. But definitions of knowledge co-production are diverse and often contradictory. We propose a set of four general principles that underlie high-quality knowledge co-production for sustainability research. Using these principles, we offer practical guidance on how to engage in meaningful co-productive practices, and how to evaluate their quality and success."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:EaFouW7jFu4C", "num_citations": 761, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3943244313982513425", "cites_id": ["3943244313982513425"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0448-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EbGBtc83uTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 77, "2021": 240, "2022": 300, "2023": 135}}
