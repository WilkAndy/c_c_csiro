Here, we establish U-shaped response functions between daily outdoor air average temperature and residential electricity intensity (electricity consumption per unit house construction area), based on four house layouts; then we examine how climate change challenges residential electricity consumption in Beijing during the non-heating period under four shared socioeconomic pathways. Small houses are characterized with higher residential electricity intensity, while large houses present stronger marginal effects at high temperature. With present population, housing vacancy rate and house traits, climate change will increase 5%\u223c7% of residential electricity consumption in near future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Nufq_to8ts0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723000641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:It1GzVJAh2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
