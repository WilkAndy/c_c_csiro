NBCSs are integral part of many countries\u2019 roadmaps to reach net zero GHG emissions by mid century in compliance with the Paris Agreement climate goals. Implementation of NBCSs not only affects cycling of CO 2 and other GHGs in the Earth system, but impacts the energy balance at the Earth\u2019s surface through biophysical effects including changes in reflectivity (albedo), surface roughness and the water cycle, with effects on surface temperature. Furthermore, storage of the sequestered CO 2 in above-ground biomass is often vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, with the risk of re-release after a few decades. Yet, frameworks that seek to balance residual GHG emissions with nature-based \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:i91s68tWr-MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-10823.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
