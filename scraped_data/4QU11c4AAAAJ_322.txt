Instead, countries frequently include natural and indirect human-induced CO 2 fluxes on managed land in their estimates of CO 2 fluxes from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF), mostly due to methodological constraints. Comparisons of anthropogenic LULUCF flux estimates from global models and from NGHGI reports thus reveal a substantial gap. Globally, this gap could be successfully reconciled by considering the different definitions used by global models and by NGHGI reports. Recent improvements in LULUCF flux modelling enable such a reconciliation now also at the country-level.We separate natural and land-use \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:C-Rn0OCouf8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-7116.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
