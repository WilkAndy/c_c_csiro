To support the initiative of The REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP-2), we built a synthesis of the Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) terrestrial carbon budget for 2010-2019 based on top-down and bottom-up approaches. Major carbon flux components in the bottom-up budget (eg, net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration) were simulated by CABLE model, Biome-BGC model and Cewn simulations. In addition, this budget include carbon flux components from the land-ocean aquatic continuum, such as inland waters, estuaries, blue carbon ecosystems, and continental shelves and carbon fluxes embodied in trade (export and import) of crops, woods, livestock and fossil fuel. We reconciled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WIXB4To3Tx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-15006.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
