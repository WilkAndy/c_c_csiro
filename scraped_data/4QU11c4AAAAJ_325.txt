Particular focus will be placed in trying to understand the behaviour of the carbon cycle under a continuous warming of the planet, and under possible low emissions scenarios which will rapidly change the strength of carbon sinks and even reverse them. Key topics include carbon-climate feedbacks, the symmetry (or otherwise) of the carbon cycle to increase CO2 and decrease CO2, and responses to climate extremes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:cB__R-XWw9UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFM.B52A..01C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
