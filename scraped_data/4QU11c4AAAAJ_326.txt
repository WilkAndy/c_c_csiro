Climate change mitigation and adaptation requires action by individual countries, municipalities, cities, and their citizens. These actions require a diverse range of information. Current efforts responding to the need for these carbon observations are, however, fragmented. There is a need to coordinate observations on carbon, GHG measurements, and ecosystem processes related to carbon cycle dynamics. The GEO Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Initiative (GEO\u2010C) was launched to further support continuity and coherence of the ongoing efforts and facilitate their cooperation and interoperability. The GEO\u2010C Initiative (1) supports the development of a holistic cross\u2010domain, global carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:wGzT3bKASkAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119536789.ch12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:quMLL9dJke0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
