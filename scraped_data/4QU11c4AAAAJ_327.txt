Sci.", "abstract": "With the focus of climate policy shifting from pledges to implementation, there is an increasing need to track progress on climate change mitigation at country level, especially for the land-use sector. Despite new tools and models offering unprecedented monitoring opportunities, striking differences remain in estimations of anthropogenic land-use CO2 fluxes between the national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) used to assess compliance with the Paris Agreement, and the Global Carbon Budget and IPCC assessment reports, both based on global bookkeeping models (BMs)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:8RAEygVn5_EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://addi.ehu.es/handle/10810/59813", "cites_per_year": {}}
