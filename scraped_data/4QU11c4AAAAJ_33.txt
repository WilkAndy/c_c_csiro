Here we present updated information on their present and near-future estimates. We calculate that global CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel burning decreased by 1.3% in 2009 owing to the global financial and economic crisis that started in 2008; this is half the decrease anticipated a year ago 1. If economic growth proceeds as expected 2, emissions are projected to increase by more than 3% in 2010, approaching the high emissions growth rates that were observed from 2000 to 2008 1, 3, 4. We estimate that recent CO 2 emissions from deforestation and other land-use changes (LUCs) have declined compared with the 1990s, primarily because of reduced rates of deforestation in the tropics 5 and a smaller contribution owing to forest regrowth elsewhere.Fossil fuel CO 2 emissions for the globe are computed from statistics on energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 755, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14987341327850848554", "cites_id": ["14987341327850848554"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KsEUBoi7_c8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 75, "2012": 116, "2013": 112, "2014": 75, "2015": 64, "2016": 48, "2017": 52, "2018": 41, "2019": 32, "2020": 35, "2021": 21, "2022": 46, "2023": 18}}
