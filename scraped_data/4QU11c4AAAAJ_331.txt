Bottom-up approaches can be categorized into inventory, bookkeeping, process-based modeling, and data-driven (i.e., remote sensing) methods. Activity data combined with emission factors, gain-loss, or stock-change analyses are the basis of each approach used to carry out the reporting and accounting. Uncertainties stem from data sources, model parameters, type of forcing, reporting level, and uncertainties between methods relate to definitions inherent to reporting requirements by the IPCC and UNFCCC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:hefNtdE4IMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128149522000101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZoH7iShedgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
