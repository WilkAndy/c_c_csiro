Meanwhile, as an arid or hyper-arid region, it is extremely sensitive to climate change, which will place the train on water scarcity, ecosystem degradation, food security and to a further extent in economic development, population growth, as well as political stability. To mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts, it is urgent to have a high-quality estimate of greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets of the natural and managed ecosystem in Central and West Asia, where the source/sink balance of GHGs remains large uncertainties. This study provides for the first time a comprehensive quantification of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide fluxes from various natural and human sectors (eg natural soil, agriculture, fossil fuel and industry) by compiling and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:bXQfdp6S9ecC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFM.B23B..04Q/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
