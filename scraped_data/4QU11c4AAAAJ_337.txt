Atmospheric N2O burden significantly increased since the preindustrial period, mainly because of the enhanced soil N2O emissions. The Arctic-Boreal region stores about half of the global soil N stock, and undergoes amplified climate change which enhances N mineralization and promotes nitrification and denitrification. Moreover, warming leads to permafrost loss, as a result, large quantities of previously frozen soil N stocks become substrate for N2O production. However, this non-carbon climate feedback hasnt been studied at the regional scale. Here, we quantifies historical soil N2O emissions from the Arctic-Boreal region using process-based ecosystem models and disentangles the contributions of different driving factors by setting a series of simulation experiments.
