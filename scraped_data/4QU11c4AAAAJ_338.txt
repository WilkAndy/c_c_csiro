Accurate quantification of regional land GHG budgets is the prerequisite for designing land-based mitigation efforts for East Asian countries. Under the framework of REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes, Phase 2 (RECCAP-2), this study provides a synthesis of East Asian land GHG budgets during 2000s and 2010s using both bottom-up (inventory, data-driven modelling and process-based modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversions) approaches. We found the terrestrial ecosystems of the East Asia is a significant land CO2 sink, mitigating a sizeable proportion of the regional anthropogenic CO2 emission.
