We use flux estimates based on top-down methods that use regional inversions of atmospheric data and bottom-up approaches that use inventory emissions and terrestrial ecosystem models. Top-down methods include the assimilation of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)(version 9) data across Australia and atmospheric surface CO2 measurements across New Zealand. Both inversions run independently and use the best available bottom-up flux estimates. Over Australia, the major carbon flux components gross primary productivity, net ecosystem production, and ecosystem respiration are simulated by the Australian Community Land Surface Model (CABLE) in BIOS3 set-up \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:V_vSwabWVtYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFM.B23B..03V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
