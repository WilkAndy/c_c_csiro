In particular, we will discuss how the feedback was handled in and prior to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the Special Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere (SROCC), the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 \u00baC (SR1. 5), and the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), with a focus on the evolution of the use of the permafrost carbon feedback in quantifying remaining carbon budgets for keeping global warming below specified levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WzTVkKNmPSkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFM.B43D..01K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
