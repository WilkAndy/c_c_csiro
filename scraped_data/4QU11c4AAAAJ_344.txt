We present results from an improved physiology scheme embedded in the land surface model CABLE, which extends the standard Farquhar et al. 1980 representation of photosynthesis by three mechanisms: 1) mesophyll conductance, which reduces the CO 2 concentration available for photosynthesis, 2) photosynthetic acclimation to temperature, which adjusts the temperature response of biochemical rates depending on growth temperature, and 3) photosynthetic coordination, which regulates the within-canopy distribution of nitrogen to achieve a more balanced limitation of canopy photosynthesis by light-and Rubisco limited rates.
