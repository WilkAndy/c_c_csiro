Productivity data are needed for vegetation and carbon model parameterisation, calibration and validation. Several methods can be used to estimate pasture productivity at various spatial and temporal scales, ranging from in situ measurements to satellite-based approaches and biogeochemical modelling. However, there is a barrier to implementing national vegetation and carbon modelling schemes because of the lack of digitised and readily available data derived from field observations, not because of the lack of modelling expertise. Our main goal in this paper is to explore the potential for consolidation of existing NPP and biomass databases for Australian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:eH23hyXCXa4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.839452639285217", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CKgQVgfiBogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
