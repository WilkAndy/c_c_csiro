Over the past 150 years, increasing atmospheric N 2 O concentrations have contributed to stratospheric ozone depletion 1 and climate change 2, with the current rate of increase estimated at 2 per cent per decade. Existing national inventories do not provide a full picture of N 2 O emissions, owing to their omission of natural sources and limitations in methodology for attributing anthropogenic sources. Here we present a global N 2 O inventory that incorporates both natural and anthropogenic sources and accounts for the interaction between nitrogen additions and the biochemical processes that control N 2 O emissions. We use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of flux measurements, process-based land and ocean modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversion) approaches to provide a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:6ZzL7HXColQC", "num_citations": 686, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10407399746018945938", "cites_id": ["10407399746018945938"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586%E2%80%93020%E2%80%932780%E2%80%930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kivzoO2CbpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 14, "2021": 183, "2022": 321, "2023": 162}}
