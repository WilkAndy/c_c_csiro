The concentration of CH4 in the atmosphere today is about 2.5 times higher than in 1750 (Saunois et al. 2016a). The increase in atmospheric CH4 has arisen from human activities in agriculture, energy production, and waste disposal, and from changes in natural CH4 sources and sinks (Saunois et al. 2016a, b, 2017; Turner et al. 2019). Based on top-down atmospheric inversions, global CH4 emissions for the decade of 2003\u201312 were an estimated~ 420 Tg C yr\u20131 (range 405\u2013426 Tg C yr\u20131)(Saunois et al. 2016a). However, some analyses suggest that uncertainties in global CH4 sources and sinks are higher than those for CO2, and uncertainties from natural sources exceed those from anthropogenic emissions (Saunois et al. 2016a). In particular, the largest source of uncertainty in the global CH4 budget is related to emissions from wetlands and inland waters (Saunois et al. 2016a; Melton et al. 2013; Bastviken et al. 2011). Wetland CH4 emissions may contribute as much as 25%\u201340% of the global total and are a leading source of interannual variability in total atmospheric CH4 concentrations (Bousquet et al. 2006; Chen and Prinn 2006; Saunois et al. 2016a)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:H7nrzBkawXsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://escholarship.org/content/qt81j4z42j/qt81j4z42j_noSplash_33fb04058ad85a34fcf4f44499ae6c25.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gb1ZCVj7TXIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
