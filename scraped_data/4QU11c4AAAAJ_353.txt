Since the early 1980s, East Asia (including China, Mongolia, Japan, South Korea and North Korea) has experienced rapid agricultural and industrial developments, accompanied by increased fertilizer use, manure application and atmospheric N deposition; however, the trend and drivers of the associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in this region remain uncertain. Here we use bottom-up (BU: Terrestrial Biosphere Models, emission inventories, and statistical models) and top-down (TD: three inversion frameworks) approaches to estimate the magnitude and trend of N2O emissions in East Asia between 1980 and 2016 and quantify the contributions of different drivers. The results suggest that, for East Asia total emissions, the BU ensemble mean (1.7 Tg N-N2O yr-1) is close to the TD ensemble mean (1.6 Tg N-N2O yr-1) over 2007-2016.
