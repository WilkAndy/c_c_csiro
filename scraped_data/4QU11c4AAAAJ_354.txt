Although a wide variety of efforts have been made to estimate N 2 O emissions from different sectors, the magnitude and trend of the global N 2 O budget and the underlying controls remain largely uncertain. To establish an improved global N 2 O budget with the capacity to update it at regular intervals, the GCP (Global Carbon Project) in collaboration with INI (International Nitrogen Initiative) initialized a new assessment of global and regional N 2 O budgets in 2016. In the past three years, we have synthesized different sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission/sink estimates based on Bottom-Up (BU) and Top-Down (TD) approaches, which involves more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:wUn16MOA3RoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B34D..03T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
