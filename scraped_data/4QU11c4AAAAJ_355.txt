We will explore major questions and uncertainties in carbon cycle science through the lens of the Global Carbon Project (globalcarbonproject. org). Will forests and the oceans continue to soak up carbon dioxide? Is there evidence for runaway methane loss in the Arctic? Will decarbonization finally outpace global energy growth? Stay tuned."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B13C..03J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
