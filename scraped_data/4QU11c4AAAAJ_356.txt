Here, we re-evaluate global cropland-N 2 O emissions in 1961-2014, using N-rate-dependent emission factors (EF) upscaled from 1,206 field observations in 180 global distributed sites and high-resolution N inputs disaggregated from sub-national surveys covering 15,593 administrative units. Our results confirm IPCC Tier 1 default EF for upland crops in 1990-2014, but give a~ 15% lower EF in 1961-1989 and a~ 67% larger EF for paddy rice over the full period. Associated emissions (0.82\u00b10.34 Tg N yr-1) are probably one quarter lower than IPCC Tier 1 global inventories but close to Tier 3 estimates. The use of survey-based gridded N input data contributes 58% of this emission reduction, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:m4fbC6XIj1kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B34D..04Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
