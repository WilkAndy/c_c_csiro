Anthropogenic activities, especially nitrogen addition to agricultural soils, are the major sources excess N 2 O to the atmosphere. Here, we synthesize the North American N 2 O emissions based on bottom-up (BU: Terrestrial Biosphere Models, emission inventories, and statistical models) and top-down (TD: three inversion frameworks) approaches over the period of 1980-2016. The regional land N 2 O emissions estimated by BU is~ 1.6 (0.9-2.6) Tg N 2 ON yr-1, which is~ 0.2 Tg N 2 ON yr-1 higher than that by TD with a much smaller uncertainty range (1.1-1.5 Tg N 2 ON yr-1) over 2007-2016. Natural soil emission (~ 0.6 Tg N 2 ON yr-1) averagely accounts for 37% of regional total amount and shows no changing trend.
