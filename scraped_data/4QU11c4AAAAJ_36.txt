Yet, the interconnected avenues through which climate extremes drive ecological and physiological processes and alter the carbon balance are poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on carbon cycle relevant responses of ecosystems to extreme climatic events. Given that impacts of climate extremes are considered disturbances, we assume the respective general disturbance\u2010induced mechanisms and processes to also operate in an extreme context. The paucity of well\u2010defined studies currently renders a quantitative meta\u2010analysis impossible, but permits us to develop a deductive framework for identifying the main mechanisms (and coupling thereof) through which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 684, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9451930976765348219", "cites_id": ["9451930976765348219"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ewmcFyUBLIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 45, "2017": 72, "2018": 94, "2019": 84, "2020": 99, "2021": 112, "2022": 102, "2023": 64}}
