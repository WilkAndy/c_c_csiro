Here we assessed the effects of multiple anthropogenic and natural factors, including nitrogen fertilizer application, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, manure nitrogen application, land cover change, climate change and rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration, on global soil N 2 O emission for the period 1861-2016 using a standard simulation protocol with seven process-based terrestrial biosphere models. Results suggest global soil N 2 O emissions have increased from 6.3\u00b11.1 Tg N 2 ON yr-1 in the pre-industrial period (the 1860s) to 10.0\u00b12.0 Tg N 2 ON yr-1 in the recent decade (2007-2016). Cropland soil emissions, in particular, increased from 0.3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Y0-TYkg6YM4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B24C..08T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
