Global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP)\u2014the rate of carbon fixation by photosynthesis\u2014has risen by (31\u00b15)% since 1900 4. This increase remains to be attributed. Here we show that this increase in GPP is predominantly driven by CO 2.. We reconcile leaf-level and global atmospheric constraints on trends in modelled biospheric activity to reveal a global CO 2 fertilisation effect on photosynthesis of 30% since 1900, or 47% for a doubling of c a above the pre-industrial level. Our historic value is nearly twice as high as current estimates 3, 5 (17\u00b14)% that do not use the full range of available constraints. Consequently, under a future low emissions scenario 6, our projected natural land \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:hQUaER0FWQ4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B54A..04C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
