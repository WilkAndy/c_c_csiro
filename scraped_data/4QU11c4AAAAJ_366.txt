Additionally, ENSO affects key regions and processes that are sources of uncertainty in future C-cycle projections; thus, it is worth testing whether process-based models are able to simulate the response to the land C-cycle to ENSO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:YTuZlYwrTOUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMGC13B..03B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
