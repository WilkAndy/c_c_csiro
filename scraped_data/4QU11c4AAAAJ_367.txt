But the rapidly-increasing N load from human activities to the earth system has led to severe environmental impacts, from water and air pollution on local and regional scales to ozone depletion and climate change on a global scale, threatening ecosystems and human health. In some regions, however, not enough N is associated with soil mining and fertility loss. Therefore, it is critical to track N budgets accurately, including inputs and outputs, of crop production systems for the sustainable N management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:t-hv7AR41mYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMGC23H1293Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
