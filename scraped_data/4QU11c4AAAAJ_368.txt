Since the industrial revolution, atmospheric concentrations of methane have increased by more than 150% and methane is now the second leading greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Given the shorter lifetime of methane in the atmosphere, combined with a more potent radiative forcing than carbon dioxide, and its role in reactive chemistry and tropospheric ozone formation, methane is under intense scrutiny. Despite this, the decadal scale dynamics of the growth of methane in the atmosphere has proven challenging to fully understand. For example, from 1999-2006, methane concentrations remained stable in the atmosphere, but in 2007, the growth of methane rose abruptly and has continued to increase through 2018. Both the period of stabilization and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMPA41C1333P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
