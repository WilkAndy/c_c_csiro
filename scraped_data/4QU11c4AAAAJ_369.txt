At the same time, rising CO 2 has significant fertilization effects by enhancing terrestrial uptake of CO 2 and by increasing ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), ie the carbon uptake per unit of water loss (evapotranspiration, E), which in turn may affect the hydrological cycle. Therefore, quantifying the responses of the coupled carbon and water cycles to current global warming and rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration is crucial for predicting future climate changes, water availability, food production and the ability to manage the biosphere for climate mitigation and adaptation. In a recent study, we developed an analytical model to quantify the coupling between global water and carbon cycles.
