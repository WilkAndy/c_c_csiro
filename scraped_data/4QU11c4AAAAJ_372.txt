The concentration of CH 4 in the atmosphere today is two-and-a-half-times higher than in 1750 due to human activities in agriculture, energy, and waste disposal, and from changes in natural CH 4 sources and sinks. Uncertainties around global CH 4 sources and sinks remain quite large, and much higher than those for CO 2, with uncertainties from natural sources exceeding those from anthropogenic emissions. In particular, one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the global CH 4 budget is related to emissions from wetlands and inland waters. Wetland CH 4 emissions may contribute as much as 25-40% of the global total and are a leading source of interannual variability in atmospheric CH 4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B43D..08K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
