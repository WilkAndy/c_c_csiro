Current hypotheses for explaining the changes in atmospheric CH 4 growth rates have often shown to be conflicting with each other from the different perspectives of methodologies (eg top-down and bottom-up) and observations (eg CH 4, \u03b4 13 C-CH 4, and ethane). This is mainly due to the large discrepancy in estimates of CH 4 sources between bottom-up and top-down approaches and the uncertainty in the inter-annual variations of hydroxyl radical (OH) chemical methane sink. This challenges the scientific consensus on the drivers of the atmospheric CH 4 growth rate and, more importantly, the possible solutions for managing realistic pathways to mitigate climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:RtRctb2lSbAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B41H2799Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
