The research community has spent significant efforts to understand behaviors of terrestrial ecosystems under a steady rise in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and temperature during the recent decades and deepen knowledge about the regional and global patterns of terrestrial CO 2 sinks and sources with top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches (terrestrial biosphere and inverse models, respectively). However, current estimates of the terrestrial CO 2 budgets by those approaches remain inconsistent. In the recent IPCC Assessment Report (AR5), the two modelling approaches exhibited contrasting CO 2 sink-source patterns in the tropics; the biosphere models indicated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:s9ia6_kGH2AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B23L2692K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
