It is characterized by large interannual variability in rainfall, and this drives significant variability in Australian carbon fluxes, particularly in semi-arid and savanna ecosystems. With its vast area, Australia may have a large potential for low-cost, land-based carbon mitigation, through protection of existing carbon stocks and revegetation. However the mitigation potential needs to be assessed with consideration of nutrients, water, and biophysical feedbacks in the context of a changing and variable climate. In order to provide a realistic assessment of the potential for land-based carbon mitigation in Australia from a biophysical perspective and its vulnerability to future climate change, we require a model with accurate representation of biomass accumulation and turnover, mediated by tree demography and disturbance, and their responses to rising CO2, changing climate, nutrient \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..2018757T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
