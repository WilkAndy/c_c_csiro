RECCAP-1, which was carried out from 2011 to 2014, delivered an unprecedented synthesis of the mean carbon balance and change over the period 1990-2009 for all subcontinents and ocean basins. The global coverage provided, for the first time, opportunities to link regional budgets with the global carbon budget, to investigate trends in global and regional fluxes [1]. In RECCAP-1, remote-sensing data with global coverage and high-frequency were under-utilized, since at the time data driven C budget models using remote-sensing and other forcing data were in early stages.
