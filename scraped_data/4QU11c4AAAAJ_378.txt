Here I'll show a number of diagnostics to characterize changes in the global carbon cycle, including: 1) the continued growth in atmospheric CO2 despite an apparent stabilization in the growth of fossil fuel emissions and the likely emissions decline from land use change; 2) the growth in the land and ocean sinks in response to the rise in excess atmospheric CO2 with large annual and decadal variability; and 3) key drivers of these trends including the global greening, spatial distribution of carbons sinks, and responses to inter-annual variability. Efforts to attribute driving processes to the growing sinks require a strong CO2 fertilization effect on vegetation growth and emerging trends show an under realized role of semiarid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFMGC13N..03C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
