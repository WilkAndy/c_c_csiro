High-resolution mapping of N2O emission provides valuable information for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This study adopted an update fuel consumption database, collected experimental emission factors from the literature, took into account the impacts of combustion technologies, combustion equipment and emission reduction measures on emission factors, and used the methods recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Based on these, a global emission inventory was compiled with high spatial (0.1\u00d7 0.1), temporal (monthly), and source (65 sources) resolutions for the period 1960 to 2014. The estimated emissions for period 1970-2008 were three times higher than EDGAR. N2O emissions experience an increasing trend (38 Gg N yr-2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.B13B1771W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
