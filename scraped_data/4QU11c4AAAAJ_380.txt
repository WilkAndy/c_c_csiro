In this study, we parameterized and calibrated the global land ecosystem model (The Dynamic Land Ecosystem model; DLEM) to simulate the spatio-temporal variations in N2O emissions from both intensively managed and extensively managed grasslands during 1961-2014. In addition, we attributed total N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems to different sources including manure/mineral fertilizer N application, manure N deposition and climate change. The DLEM simulations with multiple environmental changes and nitrogen input in the form of manure deposition and manure/fertilizer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.B13B1775D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
