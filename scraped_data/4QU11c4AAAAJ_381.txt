Responses to shorter term environmental variations are easier to quantify and may be linked to spatial variations to further our understanding on long term changes and responses. Here we focus on tropical ecosystems, using empirical datasets and various models to understand how tropical ecosystems, from semi-arid shrub lands to moist forests, may respond to future environmental changes. Key patterns in terms of interannual variations and spatial variations in empirical datasets are isolated and compared to ecosystem models. The models, which generally agree well in terms of responses to environmental drivers, are then used to extrapolate observed patterns downstream through the carbon cycle or in time. This way we assess the patterns where data and models agree, allowing us to constrain future changes while identifying key \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFMGC14A..08A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
