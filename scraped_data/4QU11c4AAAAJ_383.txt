In the sense of greenhouse gases, N2O ranks third behind CO2 and CH4. In the sense of ozone depletion, N2O stands alone. In order to identify the cause of these increases and hopefully reverse them, we need to have a thorough understanding of the sources and sinks (aka the budget) of N2O and how they can be altered. A bottom-up approach to the budget evaluates individual biogeochemical sources of N2O from the land and ocean; whereas, a top-down approach uses atmospheric observations of the variability, combined with modeling of the atmospheric chemistry and transport, to infer the magnitude of sources and sinks throughout the Earth system. This paper reviews top-down approaches using atmospheric data; a similar top-down approach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ziOE8S1-AIUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.B21H..01T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
