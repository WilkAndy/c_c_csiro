Atmospheric observations include a large variety of in-situ and remote-sensed observations from the surface or from space. These data are assimilated in atmospheric inversion to infer methane emissions and sinks (top-down approaches). In parallel, a large international effort is conducted to model processes emitting methane at the surface (eg wetland emissions) or destroying methane in the atmosphere (eg OH radicals), but also to compile inventories of anthropogenic emissions (bottom-up approaches). Large uncertainties remain in the spatio-temporal quantification of methane sources and sinks. Here, we present a synthesis of global and regional methane emissions and sinks for the period \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1910360B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
