In Australia, fire emissions constitute a large flux of carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere of approximately 1.3 times larger than the annual fossil fuel emissions. In addition, fire plays a big role in determining the composition of vegetation which in turn affects land-atmosphere fluxes. Annualy, up to 4% of the vegetated land-surface area is burned which amounts to up to 3% of global NPP and results in the reslease of about 2 Pg carbon into the atmosphere. There are indications that burned area has decreased globally over recent decades but so far there is not a clear trend in the development in fire-intensity and fuel availability. Net emissions from wildfires are not generally included in global and regional carbon budgets, because it is assumed that gross fire emissions are in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1916336N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
