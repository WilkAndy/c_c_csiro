Both the variability and carbon balance trend of the savannah-shrubland biome are characterised by shifting phenology, mediated by changes in the seasonality and relative contributions to ecosystem productivity of woody vegetation elements and grasses. Shifts in water availability associated with the impacts of global circulation systems on the distribution and amount of rainfall are a key driver of vegetation response in these ecosystems, which tolerate drought, but spring to life, becoming highly productive, during episodes of ample water supply.
