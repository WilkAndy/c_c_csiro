Earth system models (ESMs) that estimate future climate and vegetation show little agreement in simulations in Amazonia. Here we show that evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP) and above ground biomass in both models and empirical data align on an emergent hydrologically determined relationship that describes a functional relationship with annual precipitation (P). The physical relationship describes the potential for plant productivity and has a breakpoint at 2000 mm annual precipitation, where the system transitions between water and radiation limitation of annual ET. While ESM GPP is generally underestimated due to a low-bias in their internally generated P, their response to annual precipitation generally matches empirical data. It is different for biomass: ESMs show some ability in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.B34C..07A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
