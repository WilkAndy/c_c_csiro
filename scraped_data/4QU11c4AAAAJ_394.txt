The Global Carbon Project (GCP) and International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), recognizing the increasing role of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the human perturbation of the climate system and ozone depletion, agree to collaborate in a research effort to establish, improve, and update regularly the global N2O budget. The GCP has a well established reputation working on the global carbon budget (http://www. globalcarbonproject. org/carbonbudget) and global methane budget (http://www. globalcarbonproject. org/methanebudget). The INI is the only project that coordinates scientific and best practices in fertilizer use with a well-established global network of contributors and links to major stakeholders.
