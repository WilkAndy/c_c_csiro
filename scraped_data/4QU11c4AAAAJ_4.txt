Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 biomes, and fitted the depth coefficient \u03b2 to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). \u03b2 is a simple numerical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y=1-\u03b2d, where d = depth and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of \u03b2 correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (\u03b2=0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80\u201390% of roots in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 3162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=271267104325217288", "cites_id": ["271267104325217288"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00333714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CKyNgP67wwMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 20, "1999": 29, "2000": 51, "2001": 53, "2002": 54, "2003": 78, "2004": 75, "2005": 77, "2006": 101, "2007": 122, "2008": 115, "2009": 130, "2010": 140, "2011": 148, "2012": 167, "2013": 172, "2014": 190, "2015": 154, "2016": 187, "2017": 183, "2018": 170, "2019": 156, "2020": 161, "2021": 199, "2022": 141, "2023": 58}}
