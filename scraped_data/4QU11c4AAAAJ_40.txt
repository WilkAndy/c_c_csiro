The inclusion of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks in a legally binding emissions reduction framework is significant (1). However, it creates a number of problems that, if not corrected, will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 607, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11599533140241954018", "cites_id": ["11599533140241954018"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.280.5368.1393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4jR-IO_R-aAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 7, "1999": 31, "2000": 38, "2001": 56, "2002": 33, "2003": 38, "2004": 39, "2005": 36, "2006": 33, "2007": 20, "2008": 30, "2009": 12, "2010": 21, "2011": 18, "2012": 16, "2013": 24, "2014": 28, "2015": 27, "2016": 19, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 14, "2020": 11, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
