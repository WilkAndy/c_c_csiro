While theory of WUE is quite advanced at leaf-scale, but quite limited at ecosystem scale because of the complexity of interactions among vegetation, soil and climate. In this study, we developed one simple equation for estimating ecosystem WUE with 2 parameters and 5 variables. Using this simple model, we can explain why ecosystem WUE peaks at about 60N, 20N and tropical region globally. Estimated global ecosystem WUE agrees very well with other independent estimates in both magnitude and spatial variability. We also demonstrated that this model can be used to predict quite accurately the global gross primary production (GPP) when estimates of ecosystem water use are available. We estimated global mean annual GPP as 120.7\u00b110.1 Pg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..1810857C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
