However, warming from increasing biogenic emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) resulting from human activities may negate the cooling effect of CO2 uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. Terrestrial fluxes of individual GHGs have been studied intensively, but the net balance of the three major GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) remains uncertain. Here we use bottom-up (BU: eg, inventory, statistical extrapolation of local flux measurements, process-based modeling) and top-down (TD: atmospheric inversions) approaches to quantify net terrestrial biogenic fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O from natural ecosystems, croplands, and other biogenic sectors. After subtracting modeled estimates of pre-industrial fluxes from contemporary biogenic fluxes, we find the biogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.B21M..03T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
