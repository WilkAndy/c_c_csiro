Furthermore, the probable changes of fire behaviour under a changing climate are still poorly understood and require further investigation. In this presentation we introduce the fire-model BLAZE (BLAZe induced land-atmosphere flux Estimator), designed for a novel approach to simulate fire-frequencies, fire-intensities, fire related fluxes and the responses in vegetation. Fire frequencies are prescribed using SIMFIRE (Knorr et al., 2014) or GFED3 (eg Giglio et al., 2013). Fire-Line-Intensity (FLI) is computed from meteorological information and fuel loads which are state variables within the C-cycle component of CABLE (Community Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMGC33E1350N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
