With a lifetime around 10 years in the atmosphere and a diversity of emission types, methane is an important target for climate change mitigation. Observations of atmospheric methane began in 1978, reached global coverage after 1983, and now include a large variety of in-situ and remote-sensed observations from the surface or from space. These data are assimilated in atmospheric inversion to infer methane emissions and sinks (top-down). In parallel, a large international effort is conducted to model processes (bottom-up) emitting methane at the surface (eg wetland emissions) or destroying methane in the atmosphere (eg OH radicals). Although sources and sinks of methane are identified, large uncertainties remain in their spatio-temporal quantification \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.B21M..02B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
