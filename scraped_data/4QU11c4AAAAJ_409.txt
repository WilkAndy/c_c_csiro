Here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates as well as consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1389478", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e6vNj7LSETAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
