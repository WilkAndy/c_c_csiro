Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data-products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \u00b11\u03c3. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gases inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries\u2019 climate progress. For the year 2020, EFOS declined by 5.4 % relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 \u00b1 0.5 GtC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:SpPTWFSNUtQC", "num_citations": 557, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14474132630882932199", "cites_id": ["14474132630882932199"], "pub_url": "https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/1917/2022/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:59Wqx_By3sgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 296, "2023": 248}}
