This finding opens biophysical questions concerning (1) its theoretical basis,(2) the treatment of non-CO2 forcings, and (3) uncertainty specifications. Beyond these biophysical issues, a profound global policy question is raised:(4) how can a quota on cumulative emissions be shared? Here, an integrated survey of all four issues is attempted.(1) Proportionality between T and Q is an emergent property of a linear carbon-climate system forced by exponentially increasing CO2 emissions. This idealisation broadly explains past but not future near-proportionality between T and Q: in future, the roles of non-CO2 forcings and carbon-climate nonlinearities become important, and trajectory dependence becomes stronger.(2) The warming effects of short-lived non-CO2 forcers depend on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMGC22B..04R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
