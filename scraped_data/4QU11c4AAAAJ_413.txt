The objective of RECCAP was to establish the mean carbon balance of 10 land regions (Africa, the Arctic tundra, Australia, Europe, Russia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and North America) and 4 major ocean basins (Atlantic and Arctic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern oceans) for the period 1990-2009. The fundamental tenet of RECCAP was to establish carbon budgets in each region by comparing and reconciling multiple bottom-up flux estimates with top-down estimates. Bottom-up flux approaches include estimates from ensembles of process-based land and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.B13M..04C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
