Atmospheric methane has contributed about 20% of the climate forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases since pre-industrial times. It also influences the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and the production of tropospheric ozone, through its reaction with OH radicals. With a rather short lifetime of 9-10 years in the atmosphere, methane is an interesting target for climate change mitigation. Direct measurements of atmospheric methane began in 1978, reached global coverage after 1983, and now include a large variety of observations: in-situ samples collected regularly at the surface or with aircrafts, continuous measurements at the surface or in the low troposphere with tall towers, remotely-sensed atmospheric columns retrieved from the surface or from space since 2003. Although sources and sinks of methane are identified, large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.A24B..01B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
