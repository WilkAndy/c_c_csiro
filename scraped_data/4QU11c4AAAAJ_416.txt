Two weeks later, the 9th International Carbon Dioxide Conference (ICDC9; http://icdc9.org) took place in Beijing. Started by Charles D. Keeling and Hans Oeschger in 1981 and held once every 4\u2009years, the ICDC series has helped to transform carbon cycle research into a multidisciplinary field that encompasses major areas in Earth and environmental sciences, as well as energy and other socioeconomic domains, as evident in the composition of the more than 500 attendees of the meeting."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013EO460008", "cites_per_year": {}}
