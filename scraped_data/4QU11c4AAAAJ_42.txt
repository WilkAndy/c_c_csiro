The data do not support the hypothesis that changes in leaf litter chemistry often associated with growing plants under elevated [CO\u2082] have an impact on decomposition processes. A meta-analysis of data from naturally senesced leaves in field experiments showed that the nitrogen (N) concentration in leaf litter was 7.1% lower in elevated [CO\u2082] compared to that in ambient [CO\u2082]. This statistically significant difference was: (1) usually not significant in individual experiments, (2) much less than that often observed in green leaves, and (3) less in leaves with an N concentration indicative of complete N resorption. Under ideal conditions, the efficiency with which N is resorbed during leaf senescence was found not to be altered by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 530, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4520975937404949700", "cites_id": ["4520975937404949700"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/4222911", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xFQcc6m7vT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 17, "2003": 26, "2004": 32, "2005": 36, "2006": 42, "2007": 38, "2008": 31, "2009": 36, "2010": 29, "2011": 25, "2012": 23, "2013": 25, "2014": 15, "2015": 20, "2016": 21, "2017": 17, "2018": 21, "2019": 19, "2020": 22, "2021": 14, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
