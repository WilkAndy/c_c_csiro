Previous studies have highlighted the occurrence and intensity of El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as important drivers of CGR variability, but the underlying biogeophysical mechanisms governing such connections remain unclear. In this study we identify a strong and persistent coupling (r2\u2248 0.5) between interannual variations of CGR and tropical land-surface air-temperature (LSAT) over the past 50 years, with a 1 C tropical LSAT anomaly leading to a 3.5\u00b10.6 PgC/yr CGR anomaly. We infer that the LSAT-CGR coupling is mainly contributed by the additive responses of heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and net primary production (NPP) to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.B51B0494W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
