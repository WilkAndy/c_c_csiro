Flux estimates were based on top-down methods that use inversions of atmospheric data, and 5 bottom-up methods that use field observations, satellite data, and terrestrial ecosystem models. Based on atmospheric CO2 inversions, the net biospheric CO2 flux in South Asia (equivalent to the Net Biome Productivity, NBP) was a sink, estimated at\u2212 104\u00b1150 Tg C yr\u2212 1 during 2007\u20132008. Based on the bottom-up approach, the net biospheric CO2 flux is estimated to be\u2212 191\u00b1193 Tg C yr\u2212 1 during the period 10 of 2000\u20132009. This last net flux results from the following flux components:(1) the Net Ecosystem Productivity, NEP (net primary production minus heterotrophic respiration) of\u2212 220\u00b1186 Tg C yr\u2212 1 (2) the annual net carbon flux from land-use change of\u2212 14\u00b150 Tg C yr\u2212 1, which resulted from a sink of\u2212 16 Tg C yr\u2212 1 due to the establishment of tree plantations and wood harvest, and a source of 2TgCyr\u2212 1 due to the expan-15 sion of croplands;(3) the riverine export flux from terrestrial ecosystems to the coastal oceans of+ 42.9 Tg C yr\u2212 1; and (4) the net CO2 emission due to biomass burning of+ 44.1\u00b113.7 Tg C yr\u2212 1. Including the emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels of 444 Tg C yr\u2212 1 for the decades of 2000s, we estimate a net CO2 land-to-atmosphere flux of 297 Tg C yr\u2212 1. In addition to CO2, a fraction of the sequestered carbon in terrestrial 20 ecosystems is released to the atmosphere as CH4.
