Permafrost thaw, and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon, is considered one of the likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world. Yet, the rate and form of release is highly uncertain but crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon cycle feedback this century and beyond. Here we report on the formation of a new research coordination network (RCN) whose objective is to link biological C cycle research with networks focused on the thermal state of permafrost. We found that published literature in the SCI identified with the search terms \u2018permafrost\u2019and \u2018carbon\u2019have increased dramatically in the last decade. Of total publications including those keywords, 86% were published since 2000, 65% since 2005, and 36% since 2008. Interconnection through this RCN is designed to produce new knowledge through research synthesis that can be used to quantify the role of permafrost carbon in driving climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16819181963150230269&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
