Permafrost thaw, and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon, is considered one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world. Yet, the rate and form of release is highly uncertain but crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon cycle feedback this century and beyond. Here we report on the formation of a new research coordination network (RCN) whose objective is to link biological C cycle research with well-developed networks in the physical sciences focused on the thermal state of permafrost. We found that published literature in the Science Citation Index identified with the search terms' permafrost'and'carbon'have increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFMGC43C0942S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
