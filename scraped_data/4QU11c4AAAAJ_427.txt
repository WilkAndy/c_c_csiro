We assess five vulnerabilities:(1) effects of increasing CO on the partition of anthropogenic carbon between atmospheric, land and ocean reservoirs;(2) effects of climate change (quantified by temperature) on CO fluxes;(3) uncertainty in climate sensitivity;(4) non-CO radiative forcing and (5) anthropogenic CO emissions. Our analysis uses a physically based expression for, the peak warming associated with a cumulative anthropogenic CO emission to the time of peak warming. The approximations in this expression are evaluated using a non-linear box model of the carbon-climate system, forced with capped emissions trajectories described by an analytic form satisfying integral and smoothness constraints.
