We will attempt to reconcile a number of bottom-up and top-down flux estimates including:(1) net ecosystem production (with attribution to gross primary production and respiration) using 5 land surface models applied globally and 1 model applied regionally at high resolution (CABLE);(2) Land use change fluxes from the Australian National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS);(3) Fire emissions from the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED); and (4) net carbon fluxes between land and atmosphere as seen by a range of CO2 atmospheric inversions. Model outputs will be ranked by their performance against continental and regional observations and weighted accordingly for model averages."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.B31F0371C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
