First, we will present the new update of the global carbon-CO2 budget covering 1958-2009, including an analysis of the impact of the global financial crisis, new estimates on the emissions from land use change, and ensemble model results on the strength and dynamics of the ocean and land sinks. Second, we will discuss the requirements to make these annual updates a routing operation and to become more regionally explicit, in addition to the extension of the budget to include CH4-carbon."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFMED43B..07C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
