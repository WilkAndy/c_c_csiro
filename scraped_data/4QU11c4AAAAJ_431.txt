Current international negotiations are exploring the feasibility of new accounting rules, especially when dealing with land-atmosphere fluxes. Here we attempt to attribute the increase in the atmospheric CO2 burden to regional emissions from fossil fuel and land-use change, and removal by regional land sinks and the ocean. Through its regional approach, this study extends the \u2018Brazilian Proposal\u2019, which proposed to assign national emission targets based on each country's historical responsibility for the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. A carbon-cycle box model is used to attribute the increase of CO2 above pre-industrial levels to four emitting and absorbing regions, namely \u201cOECD\u201d,\u201cFormer Soviet Union\u201d,\u201cAfrica and Latin America\u201d, and \u201cAsia and Oceania\u201d. The model includes prescribed fossil-fuel and cement \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.A24A..08G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
