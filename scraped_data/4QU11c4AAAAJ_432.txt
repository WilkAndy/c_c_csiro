Under the \u201cREgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes\u201d, we focus on analyzing the carbon budget of the Southeast (SE) Asia region. Following the large 1997/98 El Ni\u00f1o event, anomalous CO2 growth rate (~ 2.5 ppm/yr) in the atmosphere is measured. Studies suggest forest and peat fires resulted in a carbon emission rate of 1-2 Pg-C/yr from the SE Asia alone. We plan to combine estimates of carbon fluxes from multiple sources, eg, from atmospheric inverse modeling, ecosystem model simulations, emissions from fire, and land use change based on remote sensing data products, and field observations, to establish the mean annual CO2-C budget for the past 10 years. We will also attempt \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.B34C..01P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
