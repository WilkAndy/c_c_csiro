Here we combine forest inventory data from the world\u2019s boreal, temperate and tropical forests to quantify the global forest carbon stock and how these stocks have changed over two time periods, 1990-2000 and 2000-2007. We compare these estimates with modeled estimates of the land sink after accounting for ocean and atmosphere constraints. Excluding tropical deforestation, our inventory-based estimates of the global carbon sequestration in forests indicate a consistent carbon sink in forest biomass and soils: more than 2 PgC yr-1 over the two periods. More than half of this sink is in the tropics. Despite the relative stability of the forest sink, our data suggest important regional differences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.B34C..03B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
