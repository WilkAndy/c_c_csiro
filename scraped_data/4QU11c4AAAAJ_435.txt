Whether rainforests will continue to be a net sink for carbon (C) in the future is an important and open question. The current expectation that rainforests will increasingly absorb anthropogenic C emissions in this century is largely based on coupled global modelling with some support from field studies. However, by considering long-term demographic processes such as tree mortality, we report that the capacity of rainforests to store C is more likely to decrease with global warming by approximately 20 Pg C per degree of warming, implying more rapid growth of global atmospheric CO2 and consequent climate change than is now anticipated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1307/6/4/042003/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lrSy-tFKGCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
