These decisions are mainly driven by business profit, environmental commitment, civil responsibility, and leadership goals. The recently established voluntary carbon market is gaining momentum as growth in the demand for CO2 reductions is outpacing the wider introduction of lowcarbon technologies in transport, energy production and manufacturing.While there are concerns related to the voluntary and unregulated nature of this market, new robust standards, reporting and verification, along with broad project implementation are raising confidence in the system. The impact of voluntary carbon offsets is increasing as the economic analysis of the carbon market gains wider acceptance and the support of more speculative investors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/reports/GCP_Report_No.6.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WGNBT25uqRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
