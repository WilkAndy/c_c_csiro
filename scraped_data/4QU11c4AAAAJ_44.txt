One consequence not so apparent is the altered structure of plants belowground. This paper examines such belowground changes, emphasizing the interaction of altered root distributions with other factors and their treatment in models. Shifts of woody and herbaceous vegetation with deforestation, afforestation, and woody plant encroachment typically alter the depth and distribution of plant roots, influencing soil nutrients, the water balance, and net primary productivity (NPP). For example, our analysis of global soil data sets shows that the major plant nutrients C, N, P, and K are more shallowly distributed than are Ca, Mg, and Na, but patterns for each element vary with the dominant vegetation type. After controlling for climate, soil C and N are distributed more deeply in arid shrublands than in arid grasslands, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 493, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10181074369505402916", "cites_id": ["10181074369505402916"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0470:BCOVCA]2.0.CO;2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JCA0ijJxSo0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 12, "2001": 8, "2002": 11, "2003": 9, "2004": 30, "2005": 13, "2006": 16, "2007": 21, "2008": 21, "2009": 16, "2010": 26, "2011": 31, "2012": 43, "2013": 31, "2014": 20, "2015": 22, "2016": 25, "2017": 25, "2018": 26, "2019": 20, "2020": 23, "2021": 14, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
