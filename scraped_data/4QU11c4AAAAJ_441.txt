Primary energy was used at the rate of 45,717,000 TOE/yr in 1981 and 174,692,000 TOE/yr in 1997 (Korea Energy Economics Institute 1998), indicating that CO2 emission of South Korea has increased rapidly.Many people presume that forest is a major sink of CO2 in Korea. Since approximately 65% of national land area is covered with forests and most of forests were destroyed during the Korean War in the early 1950s, those have been actively reforested since the 1960s. For example, forest woody biomass stock of South Korea is 60 million m3 in 1964 and increased to 284 million m3 in 1993. As planted trees are younger than 40 years in South Koran and still growing. forests may be removing a large amount of atmospheric CO2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.apn-gcr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/239d5a2c4d7d386af7aba40b92bbcf51.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1z_ekJgoMxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
