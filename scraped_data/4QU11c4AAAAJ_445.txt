According to the Kyoto Protocol, Annex 1 countries can reduce emissions by limiting fossil fuel consumption or by increasing net carbon sequestration in terrestrial carbon sinks. The inclusion of terrestrial carbon sources and sinks in a legally binding emissions reduction framework is significant (1). However, it creates a number of problems that, if not corrected, will seriously limit the protocol's effectiveness as follows:* The protocol limits the allowable terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon to strictly defined cases of\" afforestation, reforestation and deforestation\"(2) since 1990 (the\" Kyoto forests\"; see figure at right). There are, however, many more ways in which appropriate management of the terrestrial biosphere, especially of soils, can substantially reduce the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gases.* The 1990 estimates of carbon emissions, which form the baseline for all emission reduction targets of the protocol, exclude sinks to terrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, sources and sinks from the"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46495400/The_terrestrial_carbon_cycle_Implication20160614-12471-hyegv9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2DQvRGaaaZ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
