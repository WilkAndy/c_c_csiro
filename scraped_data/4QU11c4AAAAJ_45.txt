Existing global estimates of aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) based on field survey data provide brief snapshots that are mainly limited to forest ecosystems,,,. Here we use an entirely new remote sensing approach to derive global ABC estimates for both forest and non-forest biomes during the past two decades from satellite passive microwave observations. We estimate a global average ABC of 362 PgC over the period 1998\u20132002, of which 65% is in forests and 17% in savannahs. Over the period 1993\u20132012, an estimated \u22120.07 PgC yr\u22121 ABC was lost globally, mostly resulting from the loss of tropical forests (\u22120.26 PgC yr\u22121) and net gains in mixed forests over boreal and temperate regions (+0.13 PgC yr\u22121) and tropical savannahs and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 490, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2003456135816930898", "cites_id": ["2003456135816930898"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UuZxor20zRsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 18, "2016": 52, "2017": 52, "2018": 64, "2019": 63, "2020": 70, "2021": 67, "2022": 75, "2023": 25}}
