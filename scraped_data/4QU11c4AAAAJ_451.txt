Global temperature data used are a mean of four different global data sets as described in IPCC AR6 Section 2.3. 1.1. 3 and Table 2.3. The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) is defined as the three-month mean of ERSSTv5 sea surface temperature anomalies in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region (5 N to 5 S, 120 W to 170 W), based on a rolling 30-year base period updated every 5 years (https://origin. cpc. ncep. noaa. gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_ v5. php/). Moderate and strong El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) events in this figure are defined as those where the NOAA Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index is+ 1.2 C or above (\u2212 1.2 C or below) in at least one three-month period during the 12 months from July to June, with weak events being those which do not meet that criterion. Based on data from the World Meteorological Organization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:DIubQTN3OvUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/2022/documents/2022-state-of-the-climate-references-web.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G-5tdIZdyBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
