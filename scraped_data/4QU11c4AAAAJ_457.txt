An international conference on negative emissions technologies was conceived to meet the need for a broader understanding of the possibilities and challenges facing these technologies. The International Conference on Negative CO2 Emissions was held in May 22-24, 2018, at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. The conference was organized by Chalmers with support from the Global Carbon Project, the City of Gothenburg, Nordic Energy Research, ECOERA, the Center for Carbon Removal, G\u00f6teborg Energi, Stockholm Exergi, and the International Energy Agency, ie IEAGHG, IEAIETS and IEA Bioenergy. The purpose of the conference was to bring together a wide range of scientific and technological disciplines and stakeholders, in order to engage in various aspects of research relating to negative CO2 emissions. This included various negative emission technologies, socio-economic and climate modelling, and climate policies and incentives. The conference was a major scientific event and the first in a conference series. The next conference will be held in the spring of 2020. This paper reports highlights and important messages from the conference."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3366362", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nYwACBQvzsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
