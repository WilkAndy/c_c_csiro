Sites worldwide measuring CH4 fluxes using the eddy covariance method. Sites were included based on information contained in regional networks and FLUXNET, information provided directly by the site PI, or obtained from the literature. Start and end dates were derived from information contained in regional networks, provided by site PIs, or estimated from the literature (dates were excluded if reliable information could not be identified from those sources). Biome was based on the classification of Olson et al.(2001) and extracted using site coordinates. Vegetation type was based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) definition.* Sites currently included in the database (additional information on these sites provided in Table A1);** sites that will be included in the database in the future based on the results of a survey sent to the FLUXNET community on 20 Jun 2018. As indicated in the main paper, this synthesis activity in an open initiative and all members of the flux community are invited to join the effort."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:YPNY0knpFBYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://sarawaktropi.my/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6p.-2019_Knox-et-al_FLUXNET-CH4-synthesis-activity-Objectives-Observations-and-Future-Directions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IU8avFKuhHYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
