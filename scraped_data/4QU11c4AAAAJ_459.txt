The consequences of this warming for primary ecosystem processes are not yet understood, and have become the focus of an emergent field of ecological research. This proposal seeks support to bring together a multi-disciplinary, international group of scientists to synthesize data from existing temperature manipulation and natural gradient studies to develop a conceptual and mechanistic framework in which to evaluate the effects of elevated temperature, both alone and in combination with other vectors of global change, on terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, we will use this forum to discuss and launch a new GCTE Ecosystem Warming Network, which will have far reaching effects in supporting and promoting future information exchange, technology transfer, and synthesis efforts in ecosystem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:rCNdntzdTkkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13430805533382126457&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eauXIHnOY7oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
