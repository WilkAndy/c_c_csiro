Anthropogenic activities such as land-use change, agriculture and waste management have altered terrestrial biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes, and the resulting increases in methane and nitrous oxide emissions in particular can contribute to climate change,. The terrestrial biogenic fluxes of individual greenhouse gases have been studied extensively,,, but the net biogenic greenhouse gas balance resulting from anthropogenic activities and its effect on the climate system remains uncertain. Here we use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of local flux measurements, and process-based modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversions) approaches to quantify the global net biogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 483, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=849455400988081678", "cites_id": ["849455400988081678"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16946", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Dn5uxC_fyQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 26, "2017": 61, "2018": 60, "2019": 67, "2020": 74, "2021": 76, "2022": 79, "2023": 37}}
