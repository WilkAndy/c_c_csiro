Compiling from the most recent scientific studies and adding research where needed, the balances of carbon dioxide [1] and of methane [2] have been made available. With support of the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), GCP currently addresses the third of the most important anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide (N2O). Numerous previous studies have addressed the sources and sinks of atmospheric N2O. The most important source is its release from soils as a consequence of microbial conversion of reactive nitrogen compounds, with a focus on tropical soils (where high temperature and humidity accelerate the production process) and on soils with a high availability of reactive nitrogen compounds, from eg plant fertilizers [3]. In order to better understand the influencing factors of its formation it seems useful to specifically address soil and vegetation processes by terrestrial biosphere modelling.The Nitrous Oxide Model-Intercomparison Project (NMIP) brings together 10 different terrestrial biosphere models to globally combine and compare results. The underlying concepts of this comparison [4] and detailed outcomes [5] of this exercise have been published. Not only do the ensemble of models provide a detailed overview on spatial and temporal scale of biosphere emissions, differentiated by biome, furthermore a coordinated effort of model simulations allows to single out contributing factors responsible for the emissions.
