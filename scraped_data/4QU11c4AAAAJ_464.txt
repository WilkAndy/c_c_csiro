The findings also indicate that natural carbon sinks, which play an important role in buffering the impact of rising emissions from human activity, have not been able to keep pace with rising CO2 levels. On average only 45% of each year\u2019s emissions remain in the atmosphere. The remaining 55% is absorbed by land and ocean sinks.In their breakdown, the researchers determined that human activities have released 500 Pg of carbon (1 Pg= 1 petagram= 1 billion tonnes= 1015 grams) to the atmosphere in the form of CO2 since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution around 1750. These emissions have led to an increase of 38% in atmospheric CO2, from 280 ppm in 1750 to 387 ppm in 2009, and contributed 63% of all anthropogenic radiative forcing to date. Currently, CO2 emissions are responsible for 80% of the growth of anthropogenic radiative forcing. The total CO2 emission flux from human activities was almost 10 Pg carbon per year (Pg C/year) in 2008, made up of 8.7 Pg C/year from fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities, and the rest from net land use change (LUC). The dominant CO2 emissions contribution from fossil fuels has accelerated in recent years, increasing at an average growth rate of 3.4%/year during the period 2000\u20132008, compared to 1.1%/year during the 1990s and an average of 2%/year since 1970. This growth rate was above the average of the most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=6263f5453eafe90501650060786d192d4f7b604f", "cites_per_year": {}}
