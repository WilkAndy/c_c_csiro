It thus represents a consensus on key questions and research strategies for the next decade of carbon cycle science. The document aims to reflect this consensus for individual researchers and teams seeking to orient their work towards a mutually agreed agenda.International Global Environmental Change Research Programmes: The IGBP, IHDP, WCRP and other partners in the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership (IGOS-P) all have considerable existing and planned research on the carbon cycle that will contribute to this Framework. This document specifies strategies by which integrative carbon cycle research can draw upon, support, enhance and add value to these existing projects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7064553636743821017&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2TbPXhpWCmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
