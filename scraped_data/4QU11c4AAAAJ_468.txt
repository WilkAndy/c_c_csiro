Geographically, 471\u00b193 PgC (55%) is stored in tropical forests, with 272\u00b123 PgC (32%) in boreal and 119\u00b16 PgC (13%) in temperate forests. The C stock density in tropical and boreal forests is comparable (242 versus 239 Mg C ha\u20131), while the density in temperate forests is about 60% of the other two biomes (155 Mg C ha\u20131). Although tropical and boreal forests store the most carbon, there is a fundamental difference in their carbon structures: tropical forests have 56% of carbon stored in biomass and 32% in soil, while boreal forests have only 20% in biomass and 60% in soil. The average annual change in the C stock of established forests (Table 1) indicates a large uptake of 2.5\u00b10.4 PgC yr\u20131 for 1990-1999 and a similar uptake of 2.3\u00b10.5 PgC yr\u20131 for 2000-2007. Adding to those the C uptakes in tropical regrowth forests indicates a persistent global gross forest C sink of 4.0\u00b10.7 PgC yr\u20131 over the two periods (Tables 1 and 2). Despite the consistency of the global C sink since 1990, our analysis revealed important regional and temporal differences in sink sizes. The C sink in temperate forests increased by 17% in 2000-2007 compared to 1990-1999, in contrast to C uptake in intact tropical forests that decreased by 23%(but non-significantly). Boreal forests, on average, showed little difference between the two time periods (Fig. 1). Subtracting C emission losses from tropical deforestation and degradation, the global net forest C sink was 1.0\u00b10.8 and 1.2\u00b10.9 PgC yr\u20131 for 1990-1999 and 2000-2007 (Table 1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=8d23508f5b76158a1685cf7ec5bf3ebc642f51fb", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TjEc5LV74zEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
