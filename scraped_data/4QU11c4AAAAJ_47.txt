We translate this global carbon quota to regional and national scales, on a spectrum of sharing principles that extends from continuation of the present distribution of emissions to an equal per-capita distribution of cumulative emissions. A blend of these endpoints emerges as the most viable option. For a carbon quota consistent with a 2 \u00b0C warming limit (relative to pre-industrial levels), the necessary long-term mitigation rates are very challenging (typically over 5% per year), both because of strong limits on future emissions from the global carbon quota and also the likely short-term persistence in emissions growth in many regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 432, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=344574824672966664", "cites_id": ["344574824672966664"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2384", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CLgsN_osyAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 48, "2016": 53, "2017": 56, "2018": 48, "2019": 47, "2020": 57, "2021": 46, "2022": 47, "2023": 20}}
