This will be achieved through cooperation between scientists from South and Southeast Asia, and experts from other parts of the world. Mean estimates of the GHGs balance at the regional level and attribution to flux components will be valuable information for climate policy development in the region, particularly of mitigation policies. Several workshops and personnel visits among the participating institutions are planned for improving exchange of observational data, training on numerical model, and analysis tools."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.apn-gcr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5253b0bd84994dd722042caa88c18ef2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CNi0xWA1NesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
