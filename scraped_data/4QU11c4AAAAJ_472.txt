The approach is encoded in a model called Populations-Order-Physiology (POP). We demonstrate the behaviour and performance of POP coupled to the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE) applied along the Northern Australian Tropical Transect, featuring gradients in rainfall and fire disturbance. The model is able to simultaneously reproduce observation-based estimates of key functional and structural variables along the transect, namely gross primary production, tree foliage projective cover, basal area and maximum tree height. Prospects for the use of POP to address current vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12638316216923826664&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6KnNfKNRZK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
