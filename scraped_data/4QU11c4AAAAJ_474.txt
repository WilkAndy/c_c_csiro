Hence it is necessary to consider atmospheric CO2 mitigation in the context of the Earth system as a whole, and its long-term sustainability.\u201cSustainability\u201d and \u201csustainable development\u201d have been defined in a number of ways. The Brundtland Report (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987) defined sustainable development as \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d In practice, definitions of sustainable development hinge on several key issues: what has to be sustained, what has to be developed, for how long, and with what tradeoffs. It is necessary to consider economic, social, and environmental dimensions and to accommodate the different perspectives of each dimension as well as the interrelations between them. For the purposes of this chapter, we will follow the consensus of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (1996), which identified the major challenges for global sustainable development as (1) combating poverty;(2) protecting the quality and supply of freshwater resources;(3) combating desertification and drought;(4) combating deforestation;(5) promoting sustainable agriculture and rural development; and (6) conserving biological diversity. To this list may be added the goal of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of preventing dangerous anthropogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0803d18aa46d3854f94d70bf74cfacf2b1054dba", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0lj3S2UeMh4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
