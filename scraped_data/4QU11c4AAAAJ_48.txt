This relationship, however, may change over time following alternations in other environmental factors. Here we show that above 30\u00b0N, the strength of the relationship between the interannual variability of growing season NDVI and temperature (partial correlation coefficient RNDVI-GT) declined substantially between 1982 and 2011. This decrease in RNDVI-GT is mainly observed in temperate and arctic ecosystems, and is also partly reproduced by process-based ecosystem model results. In the temperate ecosystem, the decrease in RNDVI-GT coincides with an increase in drought. In the arctic ecosystem, it may be related to a nonlinear response of photosynthesis to temperature, increase of hot extreme days and shrub expansion over grass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 421, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18108733307167774887", "cites_id": ["18108733307167774887"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pxgFqv8kT_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 20, "2016": 27, "2017": 44, "2018": 38, "2019": 58, "2020": 61, "2021": 60, "2022": 75, "2023": 35}}
