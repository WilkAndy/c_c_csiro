Three processes contribute to this rapid increase. Two of these processes concern emissions. Recent growth of the world economy combined with an increase in its carbon intensity have led to rapid growth in fossil fuel CO2 emissions since 2000: comparing the 1990s with 2000\u20132006, the emissions growth rate increased from 1.3% to 3.3% y\u22121. The third process is indicated by increasing evidence (P = 0.89) for a long-term (50-year) increase in the airborne fraction (AF) of CO2 emissions, implying a decline in the efficiency of CO2 sinks on land and oceans in absorbing anthropogenic emissions. Since 2000, the contributions of these three factors to the increase in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate have been \u224865 \u00b1 16% from increasing global economic activity, 17 \u00b1 6% from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 2832, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6459196787990790860,14278200188074456839,11452255084384024700", "cites_id": ["6459196787990790860", "14278200188074456839", "11452255084384024700"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0702737104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zAKJokGto1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 14, "2008": 148, "2009": 225, "2010": 214, "2011": 242, "2012": 195, "2013": 246, "2014": 196, "2015": 213, "2016": 202, "2017": 161, "2018": 131, "2019": 126, "2020": 132, "2021": 138, "2022": 126, "2023": 61}}
