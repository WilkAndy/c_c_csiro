Furthermore, humans have severely disrupted the carbon cycle in ways that will alter the climate system and directly affect terrestrial metabolism. Changes in terrestrial metabolism may well be as important an indicator of global change as the changing temperature signal. Improving our understanding of the carbon cycle at various spatial and temporal scales will require the integration of multiple, complementary and independent methods that are used by different research communities. Tools such as air sampling networks, inverse numerical methods, and satellite data (top-down approaches) allow us to study the strength and location of the global- and continental-scale carbon sources and sinks. Bottom-up studies provide estimates of carbon fluxes at finer spatial scales and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 396, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5258229420711576134", "cites_id": ["5258229420711576134"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s100210000014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RoIFgcz7-EgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 9, "2002": 18, "2003": 23, "2004": 35, "2005": 31, "2006": 22, "2007": 18, "2008": 24, "2009": 16, "2010": 13, "2011": 18, "2012": 11, "2013": 22, "2014": 18, "2015": 12, "2016": 18, "2017": 12, "2018": 21, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
