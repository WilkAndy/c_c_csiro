The integrated assessment community has quantified anthropogenic emissions for the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios, each of which represents a different future socio-economic projection and political environment. Here, we provide the greenhouse gas concentrations for these SSP scenarios \u2013 using the reduced-complexity climate\u2013carbon-cycle model MAGICC7.0. We extend historical, observationally based concentration data with SSP concentration projections from 2015 to 2500 for 43 greenhouse gases with monthly and latitudinal resolution. CO2 concentrations by 2100 range from 393 to 1135 ppm for the lowest (SSP1-1.9) and highest (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios, respectively. We also provide the concentration extensions beyond 2100 based on assumptions regarding the trajectories of fossil fuels and land use change emissions, net negative emissions, and the fraction of non-CO2 emissions. By 2150, CO2 concentrations in the lowest emission scenario are approximately 350 ppm and approximately plateau at that level until 2500, whereas the highest fossil-fuel-driven scenario projects CO2 concentrations of 1737 ppm and reaches concentrations beyond 2000 ppm by 2250. We estimate that the share of CO2 in the total radiative forcing contribution of all considered 43 long-lived greenhouse gases increases from 66 % for the present day to roughly 68 % to 85 % by the time of maximum forcing in the 21st century. For this estimation, we updated simple radiative forcing parameterizations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WWeOtg8bX_EC", "num_citations": 393, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2334518993122291646", "cites_id": ["2334518993122291646"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/3571/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vu90yqfgZSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 22, "2021": 66, "2022": 188, "2023": 112}}
