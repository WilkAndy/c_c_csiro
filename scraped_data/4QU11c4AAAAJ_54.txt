While this is widely accepted, there is a relatively poor understanding of the different types of nonlinearities, how they manifest under various conditions, and whether they reflect a climate system driven by astronomical forcings, by internal feedbacks, or by a combination of both. In this paper, after a brief tutorial on the basics of climate nonlinearity, we provide a number of illustrative examples and highlight key mechanisms that give rise to nonlinear behavior, address scale and methodological issues, suggest a robust alternative to prediction that is based on using integrated assessments within the framework of vulnerability studies and, lastly, recommend a number of research priorities and the establishment of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 387, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9261749676686464392", "cites_id": ["9261749676686464392"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:CLIM.0000037493.89489.3f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iFV8lUJYiIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 11, "2005": 16, "2006": 13, "2007": 25, "2008": 19, "2009": 31, "2010": 32, "2011": 22, "2012": 20, "2013": 20, "2014": 22, "2015": 30, "2016": 24, "2017": 19, "2018": 7, "2019": 20, "2020": 13, "2021": 15, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
