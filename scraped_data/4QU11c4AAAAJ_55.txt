Yet, details are missing on how to track progress towards the \u2018Paris goal\u2019, inform the five-yearly \u2018global stocktake\u2019, and increase the ambition of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We develop a nested structure of key indicators to track progress through time. Global emissions, track aggregated progress, country-level decompositions track emerging trends,, that link directly to NDCs, and technology diffusion,, indicates future reductions. We find the recent slowdown in global emissions growth is due to reduced growth in coal use since 2011, primarily in China and secondarily in the United States. The slowdown is projected to continue in 2016, with global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry similar to the 2015 level of 36\u2009GtCO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 370, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14551946796609063665", "cites_id": ["14551946796609063665"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8UpEEoPm8skJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 32, "2018": 65, "2019": 63, "2020": 70, "2021": 54, "2022": 62, "2023": 14}}
