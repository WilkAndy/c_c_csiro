The terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, yet the mechanisms responsible for its enhancement, and implications for the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, remain unclear. Here using global carbon budget estimates, ground, atmospheric and satellite observations, and multiple global vegetation models, we report a recent pause in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, and a decline in the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remain in the atmosphere, despite increasing anthropogenic emissions. We attribute the observed decline to increases in the terrestrial sink during the past decade, associated with the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on vegetation and the slowdown in the rate of warming on global respiration. The pause in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate provides further \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 346, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18021771893718052298,1564919246509415130", "cites_id": ["18021771893718052298", "1564919246509415130"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yu0uzA0yGvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 21, "2018": 49, "2019": 58, "2020": 63, "2021": 55, "2022": 63, "2023": 29}}
