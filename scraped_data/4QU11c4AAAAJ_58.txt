The reasons for this renewed growth are still unclear, primarily because of uncertainties in the global methane budget. New analysis suggests that the recent rapid rise in global methane concentrations is predominantly biogenic-most likely from agriculture-with smaller contributions from fossil fuel use and possibly wetlands. Additional attention is urgently needed to quantify and reduce methane emissions. Methane mitigation offers rapid climate benefits and economic, health and agricultural co-benefits that are highly complementary to CO 2 mitigation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 338, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7147475823069148872", "cites_id": ["7147475823069148872"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/12/120207?TB_iframe=true&width=921.6&height=921.6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yLa6YmTvMGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 35, "2018": 42, "2019": 65, "2020": 52, "2021": 56, "2022": 60, "2023": 24}}
