The overall amount, rate, and form of C released to the atmosphere in a warmer world will influence the strength of the permafrost C feedback to climate change. We used a survey to quantify variability in the perception of the vulnerability of permafrost C to climate change. Experts were asked to provide quantitative estimates of permafrost change in response to four scenarios of warming. For the highest warming scenario (RCP 8.5), experts hypothesized that C release from permafrost zone soils could be 19\u201345 Pg C by 2040, 162\u2013288 Pg C by 2100, and 381\u2013616 Pg C by 2300 in CO2 equivalent using 100-year CH4 global warming potential (GWP). These values become 50 % larger using 20-year CH4 GWP, with a third to a half of expected climate forcing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 326, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9750908922166236084", "cites_id": ["9750908922166236084"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0730-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tNPnjgAwUocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 30, "2015": 36, "2016": 49, "2017": 34, "2018": 32, "2019": 36, "2020": 22, "2021": 35, "2022": 31, "2023": 9}}
