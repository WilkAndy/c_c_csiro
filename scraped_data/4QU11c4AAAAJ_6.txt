Our knowledge of the carbon cycle within the oceans, terrestrial ecosystems, and the atmosphere is sufficiently extensive to permit us to conclude that although natural processes can potentially slow the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2, there is no natural \u201csavior\u201d waiting to assimilate all the anthropogenically produced CO2 in the coming century. Our knowledge is insufficient to describe the interactions between the components of the Earth system and the relationship between the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical and climatological processes. Overcoming this limitation requires a systems approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 2579, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16607535234407660328", "cites_id": ["16607535234407660328"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.290.5490.291", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KPumIU7ReeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 33, "2002": 47, "2003": 50, "2004": 72, "2005": 65, "2006": 87, "2007": 55, "2008": 77, "2009": 76, "2010": 92, "2011": 129, "2012": 107, "2013": 164, "2014": 172, "2015": 150, "2016": 192, "2017": 141, "2018": 154, "2019": 185, "2020": 162, "2021": 149, "2022": 119, "2023": 75}}
