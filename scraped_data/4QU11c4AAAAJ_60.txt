However, forestry also influences land\u2010surface properties, including albedo (the fraction of incident sunlight reflected back to space), surface roughness, and evapotranspiration, all of which affect the amount and forms of energy transfer to the atmosphere. In some circumstances, these biophysical feedbacks can result in local climate warming, thereby counteracting the effects of carbon sequestration on global mean temperature and reducing or eliminating the net value of climate\u2010change mitigation projects. Here, we review published and emerging research that suggests ways in which forestry projects can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 311, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3426833157512913875", "cites_id": ["3426833157512913875"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/090179", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:02MWwpmOji8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 11, "2012": 14, "2013": 31, "2014": 25, "2015": 25, "2016": 25, "2017": 25, "2018": 34, "2019": 19, "2020": 28, "2021": 23, "2022": 32, "2023": 14}}
