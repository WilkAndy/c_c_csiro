Global emissions need to peak and decline rapidly to limit climate change to well below 2\u2009\u00b0C of warming,, which is one of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Untangling the reasons underlying recent changes in emissions trajectories is critical to guide efforts to attain those goals. Here we analyse the drivers of decreasing CO2 emissions in a group of 18 developed economies that have decarbonized over the period 2005\u20132015. We show that within this group, the displacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy and decreases in energy use explain decreasing CO2 emissions. However, the decrease in energy use can be explained at least in part by a lower growth in gross domestic product. Correlation analysis suggests that policies on renewable energy are supporting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C", "num_citations": 301, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7151954703398264008", "cites_id": ["7151954703398264008"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0419-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yNy8-ejYQGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 26, "2020": 64, "2021": 82, "2022": 89, "2023": 37}}
