Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and \u2013 partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols \u2013 are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project \u2013 Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850\u20132014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 282, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3952701045142516073,464389946023385453", "cites_id": ["3952701045142516073", "464389946023385453"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/2057/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:afEIg6jQ2jYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 18, "2019": 34, "2020": 62, "2021": 66, "2022": 70, "2023": 28}}
