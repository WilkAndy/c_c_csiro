As part of that contribution, this Technical Summary (TS) is designed to bridge between the comprehensive assessment of the WGI Chapters and its Summary for Policymakers (SPM). It is primarily built from the Executive Summaries of the individual chapters and atlas and provides a synthesis of key findings based on multiple lines of evidence (e.g., analyses of observations, models, paleoclimate information and understanding of physical, chemical and biological processes and components of the climate system). All the findings and figures here are supported by and traceable to the underlying chapters, with relevant chapter sections indicated in curly brackets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC", "num_citations": 271, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15842115928417691374", "cites_id": ["15842115928417691374"], "pub_url": "https://elib.dlr.de/137584", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7ubkc4CA2tsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 14, "2022": 150, "2023": 106}}
