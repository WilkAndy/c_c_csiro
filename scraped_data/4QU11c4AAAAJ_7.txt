The area of all soils in the northern permafrost region is approximately 18,782 \u00d7 103 km2, or approximately 16% of the global soil area. In the northern permafrost region, organic soils (peatlands) and cryoturbated permafrost\u2010affected mineral soils have the highest mean soil organic carbon contents (32.2\u201369.6 kg m\u22122). Here we report a new estimate of the carbon pools in soils of the northern permafrost region, including deeper layers and pools not accounted for in previous analyses. Carbon pools were estimated to be 191.29 Pg for the 0\u201330 cm depth, 495.80 Pg for the 0\u2013100 cm depth, and 1024.00 Pg for the 0\u2013300 cm depth. Our estimate for the first meter of soil alone is about double that reported for this region in previous analyses.
