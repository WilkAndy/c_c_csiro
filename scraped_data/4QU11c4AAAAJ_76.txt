This includes the Kyoto Protocol and/or other greenhouse strategies implemented by individual countries. However, the sustainability of C sinks and pools has not been carefully studied with either empirical or theoretical approaches. This study was intended to develop a conceptual framework to define the sustainability based on C influx and residence time (\u03c4). The latter \u03c4 quantifies the capacity for C storage in various plant and soil pools. We estimated \u03c4 via inverse analysis of multiple data sets from a Free\u2010Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Duke Forest, North Carolina, United States. This study suggested that estimated residence times at elevated CO2 decreased for plant C pools and increased for litter and soil pools \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 230, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10895306560608512087", "cites_id": ["10895306560608512087"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002GB001923", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V6gNUJfnM5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 14, "2006": 13, "2007": 4, "2008": 13, "2009": 12, "2010": 6, "2011": 12, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 13, "2015": 17, "2016": 12, "2017": 14, "2018": 15, "2019": 10, "2020": 14, "2021": 9, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
