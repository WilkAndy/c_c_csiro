The chapter principally examines the environmental factors that are predicted to change in the coming decades to a century: atmospheric CO2, temperature, water availability, N deposition, UV-B and tropospheric ozone. Major emphasis, however, is placed on atmospheric CO2 since there is no controversy that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has changed substantially since the onset of the industrial revolution and that it will continue to rise into the near future as nations struggle to control their carbon emissions. Various modelling exercises are also presented to show the complex nature of the interactions among multiple global change drivers, which can lead to feedbacks, both positive and negative, on ecosystem responses.Ecosystem physiology is a relatively new field that has arisen from the need to understand and predict how ecosystems will respond to the changing global environment. It is concerned with the interacting physiological processes that determine exchanges of carbon, energy, water and nutrients of whole ecosys-"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 225, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9037227419632213008", "cites_id": ["9037227419632213008"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=e7g21URRcQ0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA117&dq=info:EByZ9XSuan0J:scholar.google.com&ots=GNhGkw_Owy&sig=vU5WG5GXX7UE5X1L5Wyv0674540", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EByZ9XSuan0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 11, "2000": 17, "2001": 26, "2002": 25, "2003": 20, "2004": 9, "2005": 19, "2006": 12, "2007": 12, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 10, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
