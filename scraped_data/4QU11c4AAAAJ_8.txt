The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 2512, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=594673162172483671,80928640798263753,6176542720409979477", "cites_id": ["594673162172483671", "80928640798263753", "6176542720409979477"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004420000544", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V8i_HBe0QAgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 9, "2002": 30, "2003": 25, "2004": 64, "2005": 61, "2006": 58, "2007": 81, "2008": 80, "2009": 85, "2010": 103, "2011": 133, "2012": 152, "2013": 173, "2014": 179, "2015": 157, "2016": 184, "2017": 161, "2018": 146, "2019": 143, "2020": 132, "2021": 131, "2022": 145, "2023": 56}}
