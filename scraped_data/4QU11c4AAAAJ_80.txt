Building an integrated carbon observation system requires transformational advances from the existing sparse, exploratory framework towards a dense, robust, and sustained system in all components: anthropogenic emissions, the atmosphere, the ocean, and the terrestrial biosphere. The paper is addressed to scientists, policymakers, and funding agencies who need to have a global picture of the current state of the (diverse) carbon observations. We identify the current state of carbon observations, and the needs and notional requirements for a global integrated carbon observation system that can be built in the next decade. A key conclusion is the substantial expansion of the ground-based observation networks required to reach the high spatial resolution for CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and for carbon stocks for addressing policy-relevant objectives, and attributing flux changes to underlying processes in each region. In order to establish flux and stock diagnostics over areas such as the southern oceans, tropical forests, and the Arctic, in situ observations will have to be complemented with remote-sensing measurements. Remote sensing offers the advantage of dense spatial coverage and frequent revisit. A key challenge is to bring remote-sensing measurements to a level of long-term consistency and accuracy so that they can be efficiently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11895232536826429324", "cites_id": ["11895232536826429324"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/3547/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jD819vdaFKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 16, "2016": 19, "2017": 31, "2018": 30, "2019": 14, "2020": 23, "2021": 27, "2022": 36, "2023": 12}}
