Its strength is highly variable year-to-year ranging from 0.3 to 5.0 Pg C yr\u20131; an amount of significant magnitude compared to the emission of about 7 Pg C yr\u20131 from fossil fuel burning (Prentice et al. 2001; Schimel et al. 2001; Sabine et al. 2004). Uncertainties associated with C emissions from land-use change are large. On average, the terrestrial C sink is responsible for removing from the atmosphere approximately one third of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion, thereby slowing the build-up of atmospheric CO2. The ocean sink is of similar magnitude (Sabine et al. 2004). Given the international efforts to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate (ie, Kyoto Protocol, C trading markets), the terrestrial C sink can be viewed as a subsidy to our global economy worth trillions of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9300791907479395425", "cites_id": ["9300791907479395425"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-32730-1_6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YRwjT_YME4EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 11, "2008": 19, "2009": 18, "2010": 17, "2011": 23, "2012": 20, "2013": 16, "2014": 13, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
