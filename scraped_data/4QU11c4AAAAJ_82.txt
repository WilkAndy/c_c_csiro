MethodsWe use the same data and approaches to estimate CH 4 emissions as in Saunois et al (2020). One approach we use is a top-down (TD) ensemble of 11 inversions using atmospheric CH 4 concentrations to constrain total possible emissions and partition them to primary sources. The TD inversions were constrained by surface observations for the period 2000\u20132006, and by surface and/or satellite observations in 2017. Prior fluxes, treatment of observations, and optimization configurations varied somewhat across the 11 inversions as described in the supplementary material of Saunois et al (2020). Most of the inversions considered the same OH field, constant over time, attributing changes in methane atmospheric concentrations to altered emissions rather than to atmospheric oxidative capacity. Consequently, the inferred changes in methane emissions would be higher if OH is increasing in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:kUhpeDhEZMUC", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17290667798338930268", "cites_id": ["17290667798338930268"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab9ed2;", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XAZHscDK9O8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 11, "2021": 81, "2022": 91, "2023": 35}}
