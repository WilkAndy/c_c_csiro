The book also explores new research developments on spatial thresholds and nonlinearities, the key role of urban development in global biogeochemical processes, and the integration of natural and social sciences to address complex problems of the human-environment system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 211, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8852263359312448358", "cites_id": ["8852263359312448358"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HOw-Sj5R_ekC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:ZksGvp-O2XoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=kziPKu7JEp&sig=TGbv6CMq5uN99YaAqLTXtSSZfVE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZksGvp-O2XoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 14, "2008": 9, "2009": 10, "2010": 19, "2011": 9, "2012": 13, "2013": 9, "2014": 13, "2015": 14, "2016": 15, "2017": 19, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 8}}
