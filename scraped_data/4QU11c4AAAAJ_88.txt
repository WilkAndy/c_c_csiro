The pervasive disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have radically altered the trajectory of global CO2 emissions. Contradictory effects of the post-COVID-19 investments in fossil fuel-based infrastructure and the recent strengthening of climate targets must be addressed with new policy choices to sustain a decline in global emissions in the post-COVID-19 era."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:Ej9njvOgR2oC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17211810046626949392", "cites_id": ["17211810046626949392"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01001-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EOmymgui3O4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 53, "2022": 112, "2023": 43}}
