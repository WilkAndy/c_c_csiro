However, it will take a number of years before we can better attribute quantitative estimates of the contribution of various C processes to the net C balance. In a policy context, factoring out natural and indirect human-induced effects on C sources and sinks from the direct human-induced influences, is seen as a requirement of a C accounting approach that establishes a clear and unambiguous connection between human activities and the assignment of C credits and debits. We present options for factoring out various groups of influences including climate variability, CO2 and N fertilization, and legacies from forest management. These are: (i) selecting longer accounting or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 205, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11131338030861558482", "cites_id": ["11131338030861558482"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901107000238", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0qJMdPZ0epoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 10, "2009": 15, "2010": 11, "2011": 13, "2012": 12, "2013": 7, "2014": 22, "2015": 11, "2016": 13, "2017": 12, "2018": 17, "2019": 9, "2020": 18, "2021": 14, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
