The emissions growth rate since 2000 was greater than for the most fossil-fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s. Global emissions growth since 2000 was driven by a cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply. The growth rate in emissions is strongest in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 2332, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15454478548503526096", "cites_id": ["15454478548503526096"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0700609104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0HpyyFtWedYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 40, "2008": 152, "2009": 217, "2010": 222, "2011": 170, "2012": 157, "2013": 219, "2014": 160, "2015": 136, "2016": 144, "2017": 143, "2018": 115, "2019": 87, "2020": 113, "2021": 82, "2022": 81, "2023": 31}}
