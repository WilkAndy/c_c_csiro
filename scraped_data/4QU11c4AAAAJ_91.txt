Here, we assessed the effects of multiple anthropogenic and natural factors, including nitrogen fertilizer (N) application, atmospheric N deposition, manure N application, land cover change, climate change, and rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, on global soil N2O emissions for the period 1861\u20132016 using a standard simulation protocol with seven process\u2010based terrestrial biosphere models. Results suggest global soil N2O emissions have increased from 6.3 \u00b1 1.1 Tg N2O\u2010N/year in the preindustrial period (the 1860s) to 10.0 \u00b1 2.0 Tg N2O\u2010N/year in the recent decade (2007\u20132016). Cropland soil emissions increased from 0.3 Tg N2O\u2010N/year to 3.3 Tg N2O\u2010N/year over the same period, accounting for 82% of the total increase.
