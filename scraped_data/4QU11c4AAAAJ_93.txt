Land-based biological carbon mitigation strategies are considered an important and viable pathway towards climate stabilization. However, to satisfy the growing demands for food, wood products, energy, climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation\u2014all of which compete for increasingly limited quantities of biomass and land\u2014the deployment of mitigation strategies must be driven by sustainable and integrated land management. If executed accordingly, through avoided emissions and carbon sequestration, biological carbon and bioenergy mitigation could save up to 38 billion tonnes of carbon and 3\u20138% of estimated energy consumption, respectively, by 2050."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4921849395013915046", "cites_id": ["4921849395013915046"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6282", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ppHGm_LrTUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 12, "2016": 23, "2017": 28, "2018": 21, "2019": 26, "2020": 22, "2021": 27, "2022": 28, "2023": 9}}
