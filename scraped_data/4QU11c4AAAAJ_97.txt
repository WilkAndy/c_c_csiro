However, despite growing research interest, uncertainties remain on some fundamental issues, such as the contributions of different regions, constituent fluxes and climatic factors to carbon cycle IAV. Here we overviewed the literature on carbon cycle IAV about current understanding of these issues. Observations and models of the carbon cycle unanimously show the dominance of tropical land ecosystems to the signal of global carbon cycle IAV, where tropical semiarid ecosystems contribute as much as the combination of all other tropical ecosystems. Vegetation photosynthesis contributes more than ecosystem respiration to IAV of the global net land carbon flux, but large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10872696730311349782", "cites_id": ["10872696730311349782"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/GCB.14884", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FlbC-BGU45YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 12, "2021": 53, "2022": 75, "2023": 35}}
