Below-ground responses to elevated [CO2] are important because the capacity of soils for long-term carbon sequestration. We draw the following conclusions: (i) several ecosystems exposed to elevated [CO2] showed sustained increased CO2 uptake at the plot level for many years. A few systems, however, showed complete down-regulation of net CO2 uptake after several years of elevated [CO2] exposure; (ii) under elevated [CO2], a greater proportion of fixed carbon is generally allocated below-ground, potentially increasing the capacity of below-ground sinks; and (iii) some of the increased capacity of these sinks may lead to increased long-term soil carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4QU11c4AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3493992947080743216", "cites_id": ["3493992947080743216"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00017102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MMl3yhIofTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 5, "1998": 5, "1999": 13, "2000": 15, "2001": 18, "2002": 11, "2003": 3, "2004": 9, "2005": 6, "2006": 12, "2007": 13, "2008": 5, "2009": 13, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
