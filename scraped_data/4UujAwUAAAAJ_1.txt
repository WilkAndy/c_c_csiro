The widely used practice of determining the band gap of the coating directly from the diffuse reflectance is found to be inaccurate, since the diffuse reflectance depends on parameters such as the thickness, refractive index and surface roughness of the coating. However, it is shown that the absorption coefficient can be derived from the diffuse reflectance using an inversion method; the band gap can then be obtained from the absorption coefficient. Finally, the diffuse reflectance of carbon-doped TiO2 presented by Khan et al. [Science 297 (2002) 2243-2245] is analysed; it is found that while the band-gap wavelength is extended into the visible region, it is overestimated. Moreover, light at visible wavelengths is only very weakly absorbed, and is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 942, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7477566427282780785", "cites_id": ["7477566427282780785"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024807001948", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cbKTOgynxWcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 10, "2009": 18, "2010": 16, "2011": 29, "2012": 32, "2013": 45, "2014": 77, "2015": 85, "2016": 88, "2017": 84, "2018": 94, "2019": 93, "2020": 79, "2021": 75, "2022": 82, "2023": 32}}
