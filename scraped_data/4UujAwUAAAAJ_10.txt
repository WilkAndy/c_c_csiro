The presence of metal vapour can have a major influence on the properties of the arc and the size and shape of the weld pool. Previous experimental and computational works on the production and transport of metal vapour in welding arcs, in particular those relevant to gas\u2013metal arc welding and gas\u2013tungsten arc welding, are reviewed. The influence of metal vapour on the thermodynamic, transport and radiative properties of plasmas is discussed. The effect of metal vapour on the distributions of temperature, current density and heat flux in arcs is examined in terms of these thermophysical properties. Different approaches to treating diffusion of metal vapour in plasmas, and the production of vapour from molten metal, are compared.
