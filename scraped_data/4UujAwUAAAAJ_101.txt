Special attention is paid on investigating the evolution of thermophysical properties of C5F10O-CO2 mixtures with different mixing ratios and with different pressures; both the mixing ratio and pressure significantly affect the properties. This is explained mainly in terms of the changes in the temperatures at which the dissociation and ionization reactions take place. Comparisons of different thermophysical properties of C5F10O-CO2 mixtures with those of SF6 are also carried out. It is found that most of the thermophysical properties of the C5F10O-CO2 mixtures, such as thermal conductivity, viscosity, and electrical conductivity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11366117297795032962", "cites_id": ["11366117297795032962"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5006635", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gud-SnaPvJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 14, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 6}}
