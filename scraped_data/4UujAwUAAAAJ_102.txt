The non-equilibrium composition is characterized by departures from both thermal and chemical equilibrium. In thermal non-equilibrium process, the electron temperature (T e) is not equal to the heavy-particle temperature (T h), while for chemical non-equilibrium, a chemical kinetic model is adopted. In order to evaluate the reasonableness and reliability of the non-equilibrium composition, calculation methods for equilibrium composition based on Gibbs free energy minimization and kinetic composition in a one-temperature kinetic model are first considered. Based on the one-temperature kinetic model, a two-temperature kinetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11337161560135919152", "cites_id": ["11337161560135919152"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/49/10/105502/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MGYdQV-wVZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
