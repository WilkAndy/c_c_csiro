However, in this method, the electron temperature is perturbed due to strong heating of the electrons by the incident laser beam. This heating was taken into account by measuring the electron temperature as a function of the laser pulse energy, and linearly extrapolating the results to zero pulse energy to obtain an unperturbed electron temperature. In the present paper, calculations show that the laser heating process has a highly nonlinear dependence on laser power, and that the usual linear extrapolation leads to an overestimate of the electron temperature, typically by 5000 K. The nonlinearity occurs due to the strong dependence on electron temperature of the absorption of laser energy and of the collisional and radiative cooling of the heated electrons \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7254058706527620233", "cites_id": ["7254058706527620233"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.69.016408", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iYxovvWXq2QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
