As in previous calculations of combined diffusion coefficients for a one-temperature plasma, chemical equilibrium is assumed, and a plasma in a mixture of two homonuclear nonreacting gases is treated. Expressions for ambipolar diffusion in a two-temperature plasma are derived. Coupling between the electrons and the heavy species is retained in the calculations. It is confirmed that the values of the diffusion coefficients are consistent with mass conservation, in contrast to previous calculations that were based on a theory in which the electrons and heavy species were decoupled. Illustrative results are presented for a thermal plasma in different mixtures of argon and hydrogen at 1 bar, for temperatures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18131016388613907160", "cites_id": ["18131016388613907160"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.056407", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2CIe3FdPnvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 1}}
