Unlike dispersed carbon nanotubes, these vertically-aligned arrays have the ability to support or inhibit bacteria biofilms. Here, we show that by treating the carbon nanotube arrays with plasma, different effects on biofilms of Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) can be observed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7434903781735284371", "cites_id": ["7434903781735284371"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ra/c4ra08187k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kz6KAZkVLmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
