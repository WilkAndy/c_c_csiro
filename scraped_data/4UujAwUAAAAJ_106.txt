It greatly simplifies the treatment of diffusion for many gas mixtures without sacrificing accuracy. Here, three subjects that are important in the implementation of the combined diffusion coefficient method are considered. First, it is shown that different expressions for the combined diffusion coefficients, arising from different definitions for the stoichiometric coefficients that assign the electrons to the two gases, are equivalent. Second, an approach is presented for calculating certain partial differential terms in the combined temperature and pressure diffusion coefficients that can cause difficulties. Finally, a method for applying the combined diffusion coefficients in computational models, which typically require diffusion to be expressed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16310492879186397682", "cites_id": ["16310492879186397682"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/srep04304.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8olxX9uCWuIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
