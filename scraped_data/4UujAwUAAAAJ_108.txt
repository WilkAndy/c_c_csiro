The mathematical model consists of a two-temperature fluid dynamics model and a chemical kinetics model that takes into account the effect of local chemical nonequilibrium. Computations are carried out for the rf plasma running at 11.7 kW and 27 kPa for different Ar\u2013H2 mixtures and for pure argon. Predicted results for the electron and heavy-species temperatures, the species densities, as well as the degree of thermal and chemical nonequilibrium, are presented in detail. It is found that the electron and hydrogen atom densities in the reactor and in the near-wall region of the torch are strongly altered by nonequilibrium effects. The hydrogen atom density remains high in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1811387397710080424", "cites_id": ["1811387397710080424"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-007-9055-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qOkgtz1XIxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 5}}
