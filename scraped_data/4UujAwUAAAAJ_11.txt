The current status of the research field is discussed and examples of superior performance and competitive advantage of plasma processes and techniques are given. These examples are selected to represent a range of applications of two major types of plasmas suitable for nanoscale synthesis and processing, namely thermally non-equilibrium and thermal plasmas. Major concepts and terminology used in the field are introduced. The paper also pinpoints the major challenges facing plasma-aided nanofabrication and identifies some emerging topics for future research."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13461986699025062751", "cites_id": ["13461986699025062751"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/40/8/S01/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xxts_pOV0roJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 9, "2008": 35, "2009": 48, "2010": 32, "2011": 33, "2012": 22, "2013": 9, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 10, "2018": 14, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 6}}
