The basic properties of each wave type are outlined, and previous theoretical and experimental studies briefly reviewed. Evidence is presented that excitation of waves in the edge plasma by the antenna is responsible for the edge heating, and possibly indirectly the increase in impurities, generally observed during ICRH. It is shown that the torsional Alfv\u00e9n wave and ion Bernstein wave may contribute to these effects under certain ICRH conditions. The surface modes of the compressional Alfv\u00e9n wave are identified as a possible cause major of edge heating during all ICRH regimes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18275908847444172200", "cites_id": ["18275908847444172200"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092037969090067G", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qB1UT0QSof0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
