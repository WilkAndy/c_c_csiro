The present paper reports detailed observations of the initiation or birth of ball lightning. In two cases, navigation crew of aircraft saw ball lightning form at the windscreen inside the cockpit of their planes. In the first case, the ball lightning occurred during a thunderstorm, with much lightning activity outside of the plane. In the second case, large \u201chorns\u201d of electrical corona were seen outside of the plane at the surface of the radome, just prior to the formation of the ball lightning. A third case reports ball lightning formed inside of a house, during a thunderstorm, at a closed glass window. It is proposed, based on two\u2010dimensional calculations of electron and ion transport, that ball lightning in these cases is driven and formed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16523899879027709633", "cites_id": ["16523899879027709633"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2012JD017921", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wRaRgWSvUOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
