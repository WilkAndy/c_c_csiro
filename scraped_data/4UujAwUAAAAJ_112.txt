A double-gas-shielded system, using both CO2 and an inert gas, is employed for the arc torch; this minimizes consumption of the tungsten electrode and gives arc stability equivalent to an argon TIG arc for 1800s operation. The arc voltage of the CO2-shielded arc is about 19V for an arc current of 150A and an arc gap of 3mm, which is much higher than the 12V obtained for an argon TIG arc. The CO2 constricts the arc, resulting in an increase in the maximum heat flux density at the anode surface by a factor of about 10 relative to the TIG arc. The penetration depth of stainless steel melted by the CO2-shielded arc is much larger than that for the argon TIG arc. It is concluded that the greater heating power of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5904591656851967865", "cites_id": ["5904591656851967865"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042207X06000534", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eY9l-tNS8VEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
