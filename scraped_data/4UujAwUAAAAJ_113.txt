They also protect the workpiece from the influence of the air during the welding process. This paper models gas metal arc welding (GMAW) processes using an in-house simulation code. It investigates the effects of the gas composition on the temperature distribution in the arc and on the molten pool dynamics in gas metal arc welding of steels. Pure argon, pure CO 2 and different mixtures of argon and CO 2 are considered in the study. The model is validated by comparing the calculated weld profiles with physical weld measurements. The numerical calculations reveal that gas composition greatly affects the arc temperature profile, heat transfer to the workpiece, and consequently the weld dimension. As the CO 2 content in the shielding gas increases, a more constricted arc plasma with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11253158484743572977", "cites_id": ["11253158484743572977"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/47/46/465202/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8U1QJAVAK5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
