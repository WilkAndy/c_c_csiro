The whole region of gas tungsten arc welding, namely, tungsten cathode, arc plasma and weld pool is treated in a unified numerical model. A viscosity approximation is used to express the diffusion coefficient in terms of the viscosities of shielding gas and iron vapour. The time dependent two-dimensional distributions of temperature, velocity and iron vapour concentration are predicted, together with the weld penetration as function of time for a 150 A arc at atmospheric pressure. It is shown that the thermal plasma in a gas tungsten arc is markedly influenced by iron vapour from the weld pool surface and the concentration of iron vapour in the plasma is dependent on the temperature of the weld pool surface."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10469756047476612574", "cites_id": ["10469756047476612574"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03266686", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3l3XbqcLTJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
