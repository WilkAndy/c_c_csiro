However, there are few studies on the thermal stability of the C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 gas mixture. In this paper, the characteristics and mechanism of the thermal decomposition of C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 gas mixture are analyzed by both experiment and calculation. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is applied to detect the decomposition products at different temperatures and pressures. The measurements show that the C 4 F 7 N/CO 2 mixture undergoes significant decomposition above about 700 C and the main products are CO, C 2 F 6, C 3 F 6, C 3 F 8, C 2 F 3 N, C 3 F 5 N and C 2 N 2. Previous studies have explored the possible decomposition pathways of C 4 F 7 N and predicted the free radicals produced after the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3434456295655222007", "cites_id": ["3434456295655222007"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab56a0/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9yoi682jqS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 15, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
