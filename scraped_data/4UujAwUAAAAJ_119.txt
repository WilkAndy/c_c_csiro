Arc voltage, arc current as well as pressure variations at two different locations within the container are measured for electrode gap lengths of 10, 30 and 50 mm with peak current ranging from 1 to 20 kA of direct current (dc). The fraction of electric arc energy leading to pressure rise in the fault arc, which is known as the thermal transfer coefficient (k p), is also obtained according to the experimental data. The arc motion is recorded during the whole arcing by high-speed camera. The radiation intensities of the spectral lines at wavelengths of 510.64 and 515.39 nm of the Cu atom originated from the copper electrodes are detected by spectrometer, from which the arc temperature is obtained by means of the two-line method.
