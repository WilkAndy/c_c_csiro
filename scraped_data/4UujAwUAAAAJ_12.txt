The current status and future challenges are presented using a three-dimensional framework. The first and the largest dimension covers the most important classes of nanoscale objects (nanostructures, nanofeatures and nanoassemblies/nanoarchitectures) and materials systems, namely carbon nanotubes, nanofibres, graphene, graphene nanoribbons, graphene nanoflakes, nanodiamond and related carbon-based nanostructures; metal, silicon and other inorganic nanoparticles and nanostructures; soft organic nanomaterials; nano-biomaterials; biological objects and nanoscale plasma etching. In the second dimension, we discuss the most common types of plasmas and plasma reactors used in nanoscale plasma synthesis and processing. These include low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 258, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12272000390792641223", "cites_id": ["12272000390792641223"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/44/17/174001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x3qm6FXnTqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 11, "2012": 29, "2013": 34, "2014": 31, "2015": 28, "2016": 30, "2017": 15, "2018": 23, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 17, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
