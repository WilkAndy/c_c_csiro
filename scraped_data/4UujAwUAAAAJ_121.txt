Equilibrium particle concentrations and thermodynamic properties including mass density, molar weight, entropy, enthalpy and specific heat at constant pressure, sonic velocity, and heat capacity ratio are determined by the method of Gibbs free energy minimization, using species data from standard thermodynamic tables. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed in the temperature range from 400 to 30,000 K for pressures of 0.10, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 atm. The properties of the reacting mixture are affected by the possible occurrence of solid carbon formation at low temperature, and therefore attention is paid to the influence of the carbon phase transition by comparing the results obtained with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13784030892052989128", "cites_id": ["13784030892052989128"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-011-9327-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yETUvRC3Sr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
