The computational model used in this study is based on computational fluid dynamics methods and implemented using the finite volume approach on a 3D computational domain. The wire electrode, the arc plasma and the workpiece are treated as a self-consistent system. Important welding parameters, including arc current, wire feed rate, workpiece thickness, welding speed and geometry, as well as the metal alloy types used for the wire and workpiece, were implemented as adjustable parameters. By tuning these parameters, the performance of the arc welding can be predicted, and different settings can be compared to optimize welding performance.A benchmarking study of the arc model against experimental measurements is presented to demonstrate the model's capabilities in the prediction of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12801635873282183094", "cites_id": ["12801635873282183094"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X19307541", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ts_hMgCMqLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
