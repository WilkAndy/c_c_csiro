In this paper, three different ablation models for the capillary discharge are studied. First, based on a recently developed two-layer kinetic model that takes into account the structure of the sheath in the plasma-wall transition region, ablation characteristics of two typical materials used in the ETC gun plasma generator, polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene, are calculated. These data are required for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma modeling, and for analysis of the characteristics of different materials from the viewpoint of capillary material selection. Then, using discharge parameters of a typical ETC plasma generator working cycle, three widely used ablation models are compared and analyzed. These models are the two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16308452049059431064", "cites_id": ["16308452049059431064"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5420011/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mMKtlLtCU-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
