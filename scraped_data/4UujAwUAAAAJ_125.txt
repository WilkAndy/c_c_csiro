A DT is generally considered as comprising a physical entity, its virtual replica, and two-way digital data communications in-between. Its primary purpose is to leverage the process intelligence captured within digital models\u2014or usually their faster-solving surrogates\u2014towards generating increased value from the physical entities. The surrogate models are created using machine learning based on data obtained from the field, experiments and digital models, which may be physics-based or statistics-based. Anomaly detection and correction, and diagnostic closed-loop process control are examples of how a process DT can be deployed. In the manufacturing industry, its use can achieve improvements in product quality and process productivity. Metal additive manufacturing (AM) stands to gain tremendously from the use of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9626596689633071107", "cites_id": ["9626596689633071107"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7639/ac09fb/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A9CHca-KmIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
