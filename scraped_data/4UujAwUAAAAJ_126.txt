Numerical simulation of the plasma torch operating in the current of 160 A with a mixture of 70% nitrogen and 30% argon in volume at three different gas flow rates (8.5 SLPM, 10 SLPM and 14 SLPM) are performed in a 3D domain. The renormalization group method is employed to model the turbulent flow inside the plasma torch, particularly the torch's novel channel structure. The results show that a narrow circular gap at the boundary layer of the cathode led to a region of high flow constriction and large pressure and velocity gradients. The anode counts with a novel trumpet-like structure that separates the flow in the channel and induces turbulent fluctuations in the direction transverse to the flow, which can disrupt and decrease \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11857252726380488912", "cites_id": ["11857252726380488912"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab228b/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0OjwP4hsjaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
