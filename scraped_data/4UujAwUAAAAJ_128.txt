CO 2 has been investigated as a candidate based on its arc interruption performance. The hot gas in the circuit breaker after current zero, with a complicated species composition caused by the dissociation and many other reactions, will lead to the electrical breakdown, which is one of the major concerns in assessing the arc interruption performance. Despite this, little research has been reported on the dielectric strength of hot CO 2. In this paper, the dielectric properties of hot CO 2 related to the dielectric recovery phase of the circuit breaker were investigated in the temperature range from 300 to 4000 K and in the pressure range from 0.01 to 1.0 MPa. Under the assumptions of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and local chemical equilibrium (LCE), the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4328407897827292969", "cites_id": ["4328407897827292969"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/48/5/055201/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Kbf92AyYETwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
