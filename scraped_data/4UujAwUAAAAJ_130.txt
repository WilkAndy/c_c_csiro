These coefficients replace the 1/2q(q\u22121) independent ordinary diffusion coefficients and the q\u22121 independent thermal diffusion coefficients required in previous treatments to describe diffusion in a q\u2010species gas mixture. A sample calculation for a mixture of dissociating nitrogen and oxygen is presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7000982605026079335", "cites_id": ["7000982605026079335"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.465378", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z7JEI5Z8KGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
