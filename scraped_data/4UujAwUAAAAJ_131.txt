A particle tracking velocimetry algorithm has been introduced to measure the sputtering velocity distribution. Erosion of both tungsten\u2013copper and tungsten\u2013ceria electrodes is studied; in both cases electrode erosion is found to be dominated by droplet splashing rather than metal evaporation. Erosion is directly influenced by both melting and the formation of plasma jets, and can be reduced by the tuning of the plasma jet and electrode material. The results provide an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the long lifetime of tungsten\u2013copper electrodes, and may provide a path for the design of the electrode system subjected to electric arc to minimize erosion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7544974906160518039", "cites_id": ["7544974906160518039"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aa92fb/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lxPvwLMitWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
