The Australian PLASCONTM system is described and its current commercial implementations are listed. An overview is given of the research and development program that was required for the PLASCON system to reach its current status. The program included experimental trials to determine optimum conditions for destruction, materials and component testing, and a theoretical component consisting of thermochemical, chemical kinetic and fluid dynamic modelling. The application of PLASCON to the destruction of ozone\u2010depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons and halons is discussed as an example. The conversion of the input ozone\u2010depleting substance to CF3Cl (CFC\u201013), a more stable ozone\u2010depleting substance, is an example of a problem that was successfully addressed in this case.
