The combined diffusion coefficient method, extended to three-gas mixtures, is used to treat helium\u2013chromium\u2013iron and helium\u2013manganese\u2013iron plasmas. It is found that all metal vapours penetrate to the arc centre and reach the cathode, with iron vapour confined near the cathode tip, while chromium and manganese vapours accumulate about 1.5 mm above the tip. The predicted distributions of chromium, manganese and iron show reasonable agreement with published photographic images and radial distributions of atomic line emission intensities. The results are also consistent with published measurements of the deposition of the metals on the cathode surface.
