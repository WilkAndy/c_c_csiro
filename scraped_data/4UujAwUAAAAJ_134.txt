Electrons, ions, molecular ions (), neutral atoms including the ground and excited argon atoms (Ar*) are treated as separate species in the plasma mixture. The chemical reactions considered are excitation, de-excitation, ionization and recombination processes, in which reactions involving excited argon atoms (Ar*) and molecular ions () are taken into account. The relative importance of different production and loss processes in determining the densities of excited argon atoms and ions is calculated inside the constrictor and expansion portion of the nozzle. The roles of the excited argon atoms and molecular ions are investigated. It is found that excited argon atoms play an important role in the ionization of argon atoms in the core of plasma arc, while \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13768458737914822589", "cites_id": ["13768458737914822589"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-013-9501-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vT8JEkZkE78J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
