It is shown from statistical mechanical considerations based on the Boltzmann equation and the H\u2010theorem that it is (i) not possible for a plasma to have more than one temperature in equilibrium in the absence of external forces and gradients, and (ii) not possible to draw conclusions about the change in entropy of a plasma in the presence of external forces and gradients. Derivations of the two\u2010temperature Saha equation, and more generally calculations of the composition of a multi\u2010temperature plasma, that are based on entropy maximization are therefore invalid.
