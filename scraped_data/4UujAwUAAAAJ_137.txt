Microwave cool plasmas generated at low pressures, between 0.1 and 2mbar, are generally believed to induce only weak heating of food surfaces, with effective temperatures below 60\u00b0C, and, therefore, to be suitable for the treatment of thermo-labile materials. Measurement techniques suitable for determining the temperature of product surfaces undergoing plasma treatment are essential to confirm that the temperature is acceptably low, and for effective process control. The harsh environment in the plasma treatment chamber, including the low pressure and the presence of electromagnetic fields, electrons and other reactive species, such as ions, excited molecules and radicals, poses a challenge to establishing reliable and reproducible techniques for surface temperature measurement.
