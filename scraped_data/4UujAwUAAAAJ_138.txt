Conservation equations for mass, momentum, electron energy, heavy-species energy, each species, and the electromagnetic field were developed and solved self-consistently. The transient behavior of the mass fraction of each species was determined by including chemical kinetics source terms in the species conservation equations. Fourteen chemical reactions involving seven species (, Ar, , , , H, and ) were considered. The transport properties were evaluated based on the local species densities using the first-order approximation of the Chapman-Enskog method.
