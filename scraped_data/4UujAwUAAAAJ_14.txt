The calculation of composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients is described. Particular attention is given to the calculation of diffusion coefficients, which is a significant problem in mixed-gas plasmas. The combined diffusion coefficient formulation is shown to be a useful method for the treatment of diffusion. Computational fluid dynamic modelling of thermal plasmas in gas mixtures is considered, using the examples of demixing in welding arcs, the turbulent mixing of atmospheric air into a plasma jet and a plasma waste destruction process. Diagnostic techniques for mixed-gas plasmas, in particular emission spectroscopy, laser scattering and laser-induced fluorescence, are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 247, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14453172662564990175", "cites_id": ["14453172662564990175"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/34/20/201/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:36yS3fX7k8gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 11, "2008": 15, "2009": 13, "2010": 18, "2011": 15, "2012": 16, "2013": 17, "2014": 16, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 16, "2020": 15, "2021": 10, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
