Special attention is paid to the interaction between the plasma and the capillary in two-dimensional geometry. The mass exchange process is taken into account by adopting a kinetic ablation model and a revised deposition model. The momentum and energy exchange processes associated with the ablated and deposited mass are also considered. By solving this model, key plasma parameters are calculated and presented in the paper. It is shown that distinct two-dimensional features exist in the distribution of these plasma parameters. Further, the calculated temperature results are consistent with previously presented measurements"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15231425637350538933", "cites_id": ["15231425637350538933"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3658812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tX4O6erkYNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
