This paper is devoted to the calculation of transport properties of mixtures of water and carbon at high temperature. The transport properties, including electron diffusion coefficient, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity are obtained by using the Chapman\u2013Enskog method expanded to the third-order approximation (second-order for viscosity), taking only elastic processes into account. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for atmospheric pressure plasmas in the temperature range from 400 to 30,000 K for pressures of 0. 10, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10.0 atm. with the results obtained are compared to those of previously published studies, and the reasons for discrepancies are analyzed.
