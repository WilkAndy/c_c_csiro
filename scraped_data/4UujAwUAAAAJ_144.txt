Aluminium wires with 0.1 mm diameter and 13 cm length (low mass) and 0.4 mm diameter and 11 cm length (high mass) were used, for which the vaporization energy of the wire was, respectively, far below and comparable to the initial stored energy of the power-supply capacitors. A numerical model was used to study the nanoparticle formation within the exploding wire plasmas. The model is based on a moment method and was modified according to the specific requirements of EEW\u2014rapid expansion of the exploding wire and a high concentration of monomers\u2014to take into consideration the quenching due to mechanical work on the surrounding medium, the energy release during the vapour\u2013liquid phase transition, and the coagulation of liquid particles.
