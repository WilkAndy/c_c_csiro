The model considers the energy conservations of the heavy particles and the electrons separately. Compared with the 1-T model, the 2-T model obtains the plasma shapes more similar to the arc appearances. Furthermore, the heavy particle temperature of the 2-T model shows good agreement with the experimental results. For a pure helium arc, the electron temperature is much higher than the heavy particle temperature, whereas both temperatures are almost identical for a pure argon arc. Thermal non-equilibrium of a pure helium arc is discussed in terms of the energy exchange between heavy particles and electrons. It is found that ions and atoms of a pure helium arc cannot exchange their energy sufficiently with electrons because the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4466243044845524475", "cites_id": ["4466243044845524475"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40194-016-0391-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-5WT2GJI-z0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
