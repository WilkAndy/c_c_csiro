The all-speed SIMPLE algorithm is employed to solve the governing equations, which take into account the effects of compressibility, Lorentz force and Joule heating, as well as the temperature-and pressure-dependence of the gas properties. The temperature, velocity and Mach number distributions calculated within the thruster nozzle obtained with different propellant gases are compared for the same thruster structure, dimensions, inlet-gas stagnant pressure and arc currents. The temperature distributions in the solid region of the anode-nozzle wall are also given. It is found that the flow and energy conversion processes in the thruster nozzle show many similar features for all three propellants. For example, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2455446540724739640", "cites_id": ["2455446540724739640"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1009-0630/12/6/11/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OB7ciJ5_EyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
