Flame oxidation (pyrolysis) of titanium sheet has been suggested as a method to produce carbon doped TiO2 with a reduced band gap. In the present study, films were prepared using this and other thermal oxidation techniques and the photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency of the resultant materials was examined using a xenon lamp. The oxide films were characterised physically, optically and electrochemically. Incident photon conversion efficiency measurements indicated no significant reduction in the band gap offilms prepared using a hydrocarbon flame compared to rutile TiO2. Furthermore, these films were found to have an efficiency comparable to that offilms produced in a carbon free flame (hydrogen/oxygen). The results suggest that flame \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3393305601094813957,14233824080634345528", "cites_id": ["3393305601094813957", "14233824080634345528"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/apj.5500140105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BYmZN3dxFy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
