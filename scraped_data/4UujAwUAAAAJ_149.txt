In order to optimize the use of fossil-fuel energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, finding effective ways to convert CH4 into fuels and chemicals has become a research focus in academic circles and industry. Activating the strong C(sp3)\u2013H bond (434 kJ mol\u22121) in CH4 under mild conditions is one of the most rigorous challenges. The use of a plasma for dissociating CH4 to CH3 free radicals has advantages over conventional pyrolysis approaches. This work aims to increase the CH3 production rate at low temperature by use of a nanosecond repetitively pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasma with optimization of several parameters, including pulse rise time, pulse width and pulse repetition frequency. The maximum CH4 conversion reaches 31.9% when the pulse repetition \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11142205217962322268", "cites_id": ["11142205217962322268"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/se/d0se01593h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XOkln5wQoZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
