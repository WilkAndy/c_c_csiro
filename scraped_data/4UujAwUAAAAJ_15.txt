Combined ordinary, pressure, temperature, and electric field diffusion coefficients are also given for the mixtures. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for atmospheric pressure plasmas in the temperature range from 300 to 30,000 K. The results are compared with those of previously published studies. Generally, the agreement is reasonable; those discrepancies that exist are attributed to the improved values of some of the collision integrals used here in calculating the transport coefficients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 237, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16358642353165656216", "cites_id": ["16358642353165656216"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007099926249", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mGAZZIySBeMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 8, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 8, "2008": 16, "2009": 13, "2010": 13, "2011": 3, "2012": 18, "2013": 15, "2014": 10, "2015": 17, "2016": 14, "2017": 16, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 20, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 8}}
