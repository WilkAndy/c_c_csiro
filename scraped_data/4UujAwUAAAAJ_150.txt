To understand the transport mechanisms of metal vapour in a TIG arc, an axisymmetric computational model is developed that includes the tungsten cathode, stainless-steel anode workpiece and the arc plasma region self-consistently. The combined diffusion coefficient method, which calculates diffusion coefficients due to mole fraction gradients (ordinary diffusion), temperature gradients, pressure gradients and the electric field is used to treat iron\u2013chromium\u2013argon and iron\u2013chromium\u2013helium plasmas. It was found that in both cases, metal vapours can reach the cathode region. The effect of different diffusion coefficients on metal vapour transport was investigated. It was found that ordinary diffusion is the main driving force for upward metal vapour diffusion away from the anode workpiece in an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8631201287949914956", "cites_id": ["8631201287949914956"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X19306559", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TBMmYdcvyHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
