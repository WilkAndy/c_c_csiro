The arc plasma, the wire electrode and the workpiece are included in the computational domain self-consistently. The flow in the arc plasma and in the weld pool are calculated in three dimensions using equations of computational fluid dynamics, modified to take into account plasma effects and coupled to electromagnetic equations. The formation of metal vapour from the wire electrode and workpiece is considered, as is the mixing of the wire electrode alloy with the workpiece alloy in the weld pool. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed, and the model runs on standard desktop or laptop computers.The computational model is described, and results are presented for lap-fillet weld geometry. The importance of including the arc in the computational domain is shown. The predictions of the model show \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15383073951309330145", "cites_id": ["15383073951309330145"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X17300392", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4XZbdUGoe9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
