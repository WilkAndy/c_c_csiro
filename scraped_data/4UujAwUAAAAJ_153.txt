This paper is devoted to the calculation of four combined diffusion coefficients, namely, the combined ordinary diffusion coefficient, combined electric field diffusion coefficient, combined temperature diffusion coefficient, and combined pressure diffusion coefficient in SF6-Cu mixtures at temperatures up to 30\u2009000\u2009K. These four coefficients describe diffusion due to composition gradients, applied electric fields, temperature gradients, and pressure gradients, respectively. The influence of copper fluoride and sulfide species on the diffusion coefficients is shown to be negligible. The effect of copper proportion and gas pressures on these diffusion coefficients is investigated. It is shown that increasing the proportion of copper generally increases the magnitude of the four diffusion coefficients, except for copper \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9886608134203584797", "cites_id": ["9886608134203584797"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4897371", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HTGxcLdJNIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
