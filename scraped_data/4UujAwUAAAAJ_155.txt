SF 6\u2013Cu plasmas are frequently formed, particularly in high-voltage circuit breaker arcs and fault current arcs, due to erosion of the Cu components. In this paper, calculated values of the thermodynamic and transport properties of plasmas in SF 6\u2013Cu mixtures are presented for both thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. The composition is determined by the two-temperature Saha equation and Guldberg\u2013Waage equation in the form derived by van de Sanden. The composition and the thermodynamic properties are evaluated through a classical statistical mechanics approach. For the transport coefficients, the simplified Chapman\u2013Enskog method developed by Devoto, which decouples the electrons and heavy species, has been applied using the most recent collision integrals \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6291593909890567128", "cites_id": ["6291593909890567128"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/48/41/415205/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2MsJplM7UFcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
