Eight such treatments are identified. Three allow calculation of the diffusion of each individual species present; the other five require the species derived from a given gas to be combined. The accuracy of each of the treatments is assessed through comparison with full multicomponent diffusion calculations and experimental results. Of the first group, the self-consistent effective binary diffusion coefficient method is found to be the most accurate under conditions relevant to thermal plasmas, and its use is recommended in cases when the diffusion of individual species is calculated. In cases in which the species can be combined into gases, the combined diffusion coefficient formulation, which gives the same results as the full multicomponent diffusion coefficient treatment under conditions in which local chemical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4990698285393691067", "cites_id": ["4990698285393691067"], "pub_url": "https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/57d172397126f956,064e3b7051583747,2be9f5db44c6b019.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u8EKEqaFQkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
