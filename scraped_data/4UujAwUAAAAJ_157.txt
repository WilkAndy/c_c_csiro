Simulations of arcs in argon\u2013nitrogen and argon\u2013helium mixtures demonstrated that demixing can have a major influence on the composition of the arc in both the central and edge regions. Convection suppressed the change in composition in the central 0.5 mm of the argon\u2013nitrogen arc only. Furthermore, demixing was found to have only a relatively minor effect on temperature and axial velocity, but it significantly altered thermal transport in the argon\u2013nitrogen mixture. It is concluded that demixing can be important in both chemical and thermal applications of mixed\u2010gas arcs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11544158342600452386", "cites_id": ["11544158342600452386"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.118049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IumPWdkWNaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 6, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
