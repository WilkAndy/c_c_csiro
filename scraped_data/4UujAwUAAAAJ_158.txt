The application of heated forced air alone was found to dry the leaves more rapidly than the stems. Supplementing heated forced air with radio-frequency power throughout the drying process increased the overall (trying rate, but did not increase the evenness of drying. Similarly, applying radio-frequency power to partially-dried alfalfa was not effective in levelling the moisture contents of the stems and leaves. Measurements of the dielectric properties of alfalfa in the frequency range 0.5 to 50 MHz are presented in an Appendix."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15170537745944276023", "cites_id": ["15170537745944276023"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08327823.1992.11688195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N-yp9rOTiNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
