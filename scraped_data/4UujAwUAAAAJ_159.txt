The use of SF6 is being reduced because of its high global warming potential. To describe the physical and chemical processes occurring in the arc plasma in circuit breakers, both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and nonlocal chemical equilibrium (LCE) conditions have to be considered. The plasma composition of the arc core region can be calculated under the assumption of LTE by the method of minimization of the Gibbs free energy. The plasma composition of the arc boundary region or during the arc ignition period is not in LTE or LCE, so the use of a chemical kinetic model that considers the effects of the energy barrier in chemical reactions is required.
