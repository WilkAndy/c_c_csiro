We found that the presence of the glass spheres decreased the breakdown voltage, but that the ozone production rate was smaller at higher voltages than for a conventional air-gap ozonizer. The character of the discharge was found to range between a steady glow and short-lived filaments, depending on the sphere diameter, the width of the discharge gap, the voltage, the gas flow, and the discharge gas. We present images of the different discharge types."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10231620019300766776", "cites_id": ["10231620019300766776"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1003983/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OJQytzIE_o0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
