Over the last decade, low-pressure (50\u2013200 Pa) plasma spray - physical vapor deposition (PS - PVD) has been recognized as a promising method for obtaining advanced high-temperature performance thermal barrier coatings on gas turbines or aircraft engines. However, challenges still exist in experimental measurements and numerical modeling inside very large supersonic fluid fields (at the meter scale) with multiple phases (at micron- or nano-scale) at temperatures over 12000 K and velocities of over 6000 m/s. The plasma spray flow and heat and mass transfer in a closed chamber are not fully understood owing to the complicated interaction of the supersonic flow, swirling flow, phase transition \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:DkZNVXde3BIC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1180316287495625822", "cites_id": ["1180316287495625822"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542529321001425", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XtzI7mhTYRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 12}}
