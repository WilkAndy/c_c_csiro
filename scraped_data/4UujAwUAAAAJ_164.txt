Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a transformative digital technology poised to disrupt manufacturing and supply chains across major industries. Here we critically examine relevant insights into current and emerging applications of plasma nanotechnology in printing, including 3D printing. Plasma devices operated at atmospheric pressure coupled with printing processes may help strengthen 3D printing as an emerging fabrication technology that morphs diverse metal powders, polymers, plastics and other materials into digitally designed 3D shapes and patterns. We discuss how plasma applications may help overcome current limitations of 3D printing in various fields, e.g., limitations of sculpting composite materials, lack of mechanical strength and the need for post-processing.
