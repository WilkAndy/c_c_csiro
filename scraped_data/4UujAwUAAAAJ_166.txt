Computational models of thermal plasma applications typically consider the influence of the plasma on the surface, but often neglect the effect of the surface on the plasma. In many cases, however, it is not possible to accurately model the plasma process without taking the two\u2010way interactions into account. This is demonstrated using examples from arc welding, plasma cutting, plasma\u2010particle interactions, such as occur in plasma spheroidization, plasma nanoparticle production and plasma spraying, and high\u2010 and low\u2010voltage circuit breakers. Vaporization of metal, ceramic and polymer surfaces, transfer of heat and momentum from the plasma to particles and droplets, and changes in the surface shape are all shown to affect the properties of the plasma."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6926391999281130874", "cites_id": ["6926391999281130874"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppap.201600177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:em1CZNN8H2AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
