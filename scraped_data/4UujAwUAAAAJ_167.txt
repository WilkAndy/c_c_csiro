A new method (method A) has recently been developed, based on the modified Chapman\u2013Enskog solution of the species Boltzmann equations. This method retains coupling between electrons and heavy species by including the electron\u2013heavy-species collision term in the heavy-species Boltzmann equation. In this paper, the properties of 2-T argon plasmas calculated using the three methods are compared. The viscosity, electrical conductivity and translational thermal conductivity obtained using all three methods are very similar. method B does not allow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5190563910202393730", "cites_id": ["5190563910202393730"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0963-0252/24/3/035011/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:goSTI2CWCEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
