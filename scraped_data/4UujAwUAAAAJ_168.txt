CO 2 is one of the most likely candidates for an environment-friendly arc-quenching medium to replace SF 6 in high-voltage circuit breakers. Initially, the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is derived by solving the Boltzmann equation under the zero-dimensional two-term spherical harmonic approximation. Then the reduced ionization and attachment coefficients are obtained, based on the calculated EEDF. Finally, the critical reduced electric field strength (E/N) cr, which is defined as the value for which total ionization reactions are equal to total attachment reactions, is obtained and analysed. The results demonstrate the superior breakdown properties of a 50% CO 2\u201350% O 2 mixture to those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14456705839603972171", "cites_id": ["14456705839603972171"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/47/32/325203/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S_jov12JoMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
