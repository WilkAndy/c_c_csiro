This model describes in a self-consistent manner the gas flow and heat transfer, the coupling of the electric energy deposited into the plasma, and the reaction kinetics including the contribution of excited species. It is found that the plasma is far from thermodynamic equilibrium in the entire argon plasma flow expansion process through a nozzle. Significant temperature discrepancies between electrons and heavy species are found in the cooler outer region. The dominant chemical kinetic processes in different plasma gas expansion regions are presented and discussed. It is noted that although the number density of excited argon atoms (Ar*) is much lower than that of other species in the argon plasma, Ar* play important roles in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=748023628198889600", "cites_id": ["748023628198889600"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/46/50/505205/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gMhk0oaDYQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
