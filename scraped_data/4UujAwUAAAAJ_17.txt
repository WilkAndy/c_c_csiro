The influence of thermophysical properties on the parameters of tungsten\u2013inert-gas (TIG) welding arcs, particularly those that affect the weld pool, is investigated using a two-dimensional model in which the arc, anode and cathode are included self-consistently. The effect of changing each of six thermophysical properties on the characteristics of an argon TIG arc is assessed. The influence of the product of specific heat and mass density is found to be particularly important in determining the arc constriction. By examining the influence of the different properties on the heat flux density, current density and shear stress at the anode, it is concluded that the weld pool depth can be increased by using shielding gases with high specific heat, thermal conductivity and viscosity.
