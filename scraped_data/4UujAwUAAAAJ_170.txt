They neglect vaporization and assume an argon atmosphere for the arc region, as it is common practice for models of gas tungsten arc welding. These models predict temperatures above 20 000 K and a temperature distribution similar to tungsten inert gas (TIG) arcs. However, current spectroscopic temperature measurements in GMAW arcs demonstrate much lower arc temperatures. In contrast to TIG arcs they found a central local minimum of the radial temperature distribution. The paper presents a GMAW arc model that considers metal vapour and which is in a very good agreement with experimentally observed temperatures. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the local central minimum in the radial temperature and the radial electric current density distributions for the first time. The axially symmetric model of the welding torch, the work piece, the wire and the arc (fluid domain) implements MHD as well as turbulent mixing and thermal demixing of metal vapour in argon. The mass fraction of iron vapour obtained from the simulation shows an accumulation in the arc core and another accumulation on the fringes of the arc at 2000 to 5000 K. The demixing effects lead to very low concentrations of iron between these two regions. Sensitive analyses demonstrate the influence of the transport and radiation properties of metal vapour, and the evaporation rate relative to the wire feed. Finally the model predictions are compared with the measuring results of Zieli\u0144ska \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8178262585091320847", "cites_id": ["8178262585091320847"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony-Murphy-10/publication/226243533_Numerical_investigations_of_arc_behaviour_in_gas_metal_arc_welding_using_ANSYS_CFX/links/53e814fc0cf25d674ea7fb50/Numerical-investigations-of-arc-behaviour-in-gas-metal-arc-welding-using-ANSYS-CFX.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D2w8qH0Gf3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
