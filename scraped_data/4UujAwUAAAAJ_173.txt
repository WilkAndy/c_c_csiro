It is found that the degree of ionization of the carbon flux strongly affects the kinetics of nanotube and nanocone nucleation on partially saturated catalyst patterns. The use of highly ionized carbon flux allows formation of a nanotube array with a very narrow height distribution of half-width 7 nm. Similar results are obtained for carbon nanocone arrays, with an even narrower height distribution, using a highly ionized carbon flux. As the deposition time increases, nanostructure arrays develop without widening the height distribution when the flux ionization degree is high, in contrast to the fairly broad nanostructure height distributions obtained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13458825415897954271", "cites_id": ["13458825415897954271"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2996272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:37eYaGhax7oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
