Detailed argon chemical kinetic processes and self-consistent effective binary diffusion coefficient approximation treatment of diffusion are coupled with a single-fluid, two-temperature model to investigate the plasma characteristics of the near-anode region. The diffuse and constricted arc attachment modes to the anode are obtained self-consistently by changing the gas flow rates. The results show that the high current density and associated self-induced magnetic field of the constricted arc attachment give rise to a large Lorentz force near the anode, resulting in an anode jet. The convection process dominated by the cathode jet is conducive to the radial transport of electrons in the diffuse arc attachment mode, while in the constricted arc attachment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3132174298009711940", "cites_id": ["3132174298009711940"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-019-10027-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RDV61-23dysJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 6}}
