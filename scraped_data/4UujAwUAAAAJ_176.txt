In particular, existing models failed to reproduce the highly transient (down to several tens of nanoseconds) physical interactions between solid, liquid, vapor plume and plasma occurring in the welding process. These interactions control the key physical processes of laser-arc hybrid welding and play dominant roles in process defect formation and final joint quality. Development of a unified model for laser-arc hybrid welding capable of modeling the multiphase physical interactions is faced with three major challenges. The first is how to decouple the highly correlated and mesoscopic interactions between the solid, liquid, vapor plume and plasma phases. The second and third are respectively the numerical treatments of the nonlinear discontinuous sheath layer between the arc plasma \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:7H_MAutzIkAC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15130989148226126641", "cites_id": ["15130989148226126641"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612519300714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MQNPgHYS_NEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
