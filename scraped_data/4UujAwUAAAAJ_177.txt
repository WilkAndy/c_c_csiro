In this paper, an extension of this method to allow treatment of diffusion of a three-gas mixture has been achieved, provided that the gases are homonuclear and do not react with each other, and satisfy local chemical equilibrium. Formulas for the combined diffusion coefficients are presented, and combined diffusion coefficients for different mixtures of helium, argon and carbon at temperatures up to 30 000 K and at atmosphere pressure are calculated as an example."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6311353490851700350", "cites_id": ["6311353490851700350"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0963-0252/23/6/065044/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fh4jmo9ullcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
