Here, using nitrogen and water as raw materials, a nonthermal plasma catalysis approach is demonstrated as an effective power\u2010to\u2010chemicals conversion strategy for ammonia production. By sustaining a highly reactive environment, successful plasma\u2010catalytic production of NH3 was achieved from the dissociation of N2 and H2O under mild conditions. Plasma\u2010induced vibrational excitation is found to decrease the N2 and H2O dissociation barriers, with the presence of matched catalysts in the nonthermal plasma discharge reactor contributing significantly to molecular dissociation on the catalyst surface. Density functional theory calculations for the activation energy barrier for the dissociation suggest that ruthenium catalysts supported on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=354984795669894989", "cites_id": ["354984795669894989"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eem2.12344", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TZeRdsoo7QQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 11}}
