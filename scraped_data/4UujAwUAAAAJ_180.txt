This letter proposes a mud-like EM composed of nitromethane, aluminium and copper oxide powder, which can be detonated directly by a tungsten wire explosion. The detonation and successive deflagration result in notably enhanced SWs: with 2.8 g EM, the SW amplitude, impulse and energy are respectively increased by 1.7, 2.1, and 7.9 times compared to an optimal underwater EWE. A direct thermal initiation mechanism for the detonation process is proposed, with the exploding wire, the Joule heating along the current path in the EM and the Al/CuO thermite reaction all serving as heat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14772844092130533680", "cites_id": ["14772844092130533680"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac3174/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MCGrkW6vA80J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
