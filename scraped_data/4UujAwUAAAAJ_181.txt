Industrial applications are already seen in oil-well unblocking and stratum stimulation, and research is currently underway to apply UEWEs in electro-hydraulic forming, exploitation of unconventional gas and oil resources, etc. The emerging new applications call for a review on UEWE research from the perspective of an efficient SW source. This review paper considers the physical processes and numerical simulation methods, electrical and SW characteristics, and current and potential applications, and provides suggestions for future research directions. The code (XJ_UEWE01) developed by the authors to solve a coupling model of UEWE is included. The paper will provide students and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14061828305454397497", "cites_id": ["14061828305454397497"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac10a3/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OXgkT1emJcMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
