C5-perfluorinated ketone (C 5 F 10 O or C5-PFK) has excellent insulation properties and environmental characteristics, and has been chosen as an alternative gas to SF 6. Calculation of thermal decomposition is usually based on local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and local chemical equilibrium assumptions. However, the composition may not reach chemical equilibrium, particularly at lower temperatures and high rates of temperature increase. In order to compare the chemical non-equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium compositions, a chemical kinetic model is used to calculate time evolution of composition; this considers the effects of the energy barrier in chemical reactions. To obtain the required data for the model, which is necessary because of the limited research on reaction \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15551437469335636200", "cites_id": ["15551437469335636200"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aade62/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6EhzuvvN0dcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
