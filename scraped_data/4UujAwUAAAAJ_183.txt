The widely used kinetic ablation model (model-K) only considers monatomic vapor. A revised model (model-Z) was introduced by taking into account the polyatomic vapor\u2019s internal degrees of freedom, as well as the temperature dependence of the average particle mass. In this work, both temperature and pressure dependence of average particle mass and the specific heat ratio  are taken into account, producing an improved version of model-Z (denoted model-). Ablation data calculated by model-K and model- for two typical capillary materials are presented. Compared to model-K, model- predicts an increased ablation rate at lower plasma temperature and higher plasma density, and a decreased rate for the opposite conditions. Finally, based on the plasma parameters in a typical discharge cycle, all three models are used to calculate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=547193793489509951", "cites_id": ["547193793489509951"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3465316", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P549JNsFmAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
