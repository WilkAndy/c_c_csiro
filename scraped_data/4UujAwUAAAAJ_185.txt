The authors examine the effect of replacing the vacuum layer by a region of low density plasma. The low density region has little effect on negative m surface waves, but introduces an ion cyclotron resonance and a waveguide cut-off for positive m modes. These effects are associated with the fact that positive m modes are left hand polarised near the plasma edge. Dispersion relations for stepped and parabolic density profiles are examined. A profile with N discrete steps and a vacuum boundary supports a discrete spectrum of N+ 1 first radial modes. When N is large, these modes can be identified as N localised torsional wave modes plus one surface wave mode."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5835301711043624949", "cites_id": ["5835301711043624949"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0741-3335/28/3/006/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9f_7S_0n-1AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
