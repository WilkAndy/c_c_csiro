Hence, more fundamental research is needed to understand these mechanisms. This can be obtained by both modelling and experiments. This foundations paper describes the fundamental insights in plasma catalysis, as well as efforts to gain more insights by modelling and experiments. Furthermore, it discusses the state-of-the-art of the major plasma catalysis applications, as well as successes and challenges of technology transfer of these applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=669832802010215354", "cites_id": ["669832802010215354"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6595/ac5f8e/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ujO5bmK5SwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 8}}
