This study aims to clarify the fume formation process theoretically through numerical analysis. A fume formation model consisting of a homogeneous nucleation model, a heterogeneous condensation model, and a coagulation model was coupled with a GMA welding model. A series of processes such as evaporation of metal vapor from molten metal, transport of the metal vapor in the arc, fume formation from the metal vapor, and transport of the fume to the surrounding was investigated by employing this coupled simulation model. In this paper, the influence on the fume formation process of changing the shielding gas from Ar to CO2 and the associated change in arc characteristics, leading to different droplet formation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12021102897986367552", "cites_id": ["12021102897986367552"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40194-018-0656-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QHDlKmWJ06YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
