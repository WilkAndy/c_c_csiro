A three-dimensional (3-D) model of arc motion under the effect of external magnetic field is built based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. By adopting the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package based on the control-volume method, the above MHD equations are solved. For the media of air-10% PA and air-10% POM, the distributions of stationary temperature and electrical potential and the transient motion processes are compared with those of air arc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9457058890770402659", "cites_id": ["9457058890770402659"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1009-0630/8/6/12/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y81RnPQ4PoMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
