An equation to calculate the PTFE concentration in the mixture is introduced together with overall mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations for the mixture. The thermodynamic and transport properties of SF/sub 6/-PTFE vapor mixture calculated by the transport theory are given. An empirical relationship between radiation reabsorption factor and the relevant arcing parameters (nozzle size and instantaneous arcing current) has been employed to make predictions. The features of temperature, pressure, PTFE mass concentration, and flow fields during the whole arcing period are discussed. It is shown that the energy brought into the expansion volume by the hot PTFE vapor is mainly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7019697398542618510", "cites_id": ["7019697398542618510"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1024273/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:js_djpf5amEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 13, "2008": 6, "2009": 12, "2010": 14, "2011": 2, "2012": 14, "2013": 16, "2014": 17, "2015": 17, "2016": 13, "2017": 16, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
