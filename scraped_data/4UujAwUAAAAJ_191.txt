Motivated by the fact that the chemical reactions in plasma-based CH 4 conversion are dominated and regulated by the energetic electrons and various radicals, the temporal evolution of the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) and its relation to hydrogen (H) radical generation in an atmospheric-pressure CH 4 needle\u2013plane discharge plasma have been investigated numerically. The simulations are carried out using one-dimensional particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo collision and fluid dynamic models. It can be shown that during the formation and development of the streamer, a characteristic time exists, before and after which the evolution characteristic of the EEDF is reversed. This is mainly attributed to the competition between the energies continuously obtained from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:VN7nJs4JPk0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4936972454809560290", "cites_id": ["4936972454809560290"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/abca61/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4uTPWkqmg0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
