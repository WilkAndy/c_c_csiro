Plasma flows in arcjet thruster with different input mole ratios of nitrogen to hydrogen are modelled. It is found that species separation due to nonequilibrium chemical kinetic processes occurs mainly in the regions where the dissociation and ionization of nitrogen and hydrogen species take place. The enrichment of nitrogen molecules at the fringes of the arc and hydrogen molecules near the anode wall of the thruster occurs mainly because the recombination processes of these two gases occur in different temperature ranges. In the expansion portion of the thruster nozzle, the gas residence times are of the same order as some chemical kinetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2048398228071584903", "cites_id": ["2048398228071584903"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-017-9807-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hxS_5lVfbRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
