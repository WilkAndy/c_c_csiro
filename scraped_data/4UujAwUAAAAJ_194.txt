A fume formation model consisting of heterogeneous condensation model, homogeneous nucleation model and coagulation model considering Brownian force and Coulomb force as driving force of particle has been developed and coupled with a GMA welding model. A series of processes from evaporation of metal vapor to fume formation from the metal vapor was totally investigated by employing this simulation model. This study aims to visualize the fume formation process and clarify the fume formation mechanism theoretically through numerical analysis. Furthermore, the reliability of the simulation model was also evaluated through comparison of the simulation result with experimental result. As a result, it was also clarified that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5415448875811887735", "cites_id": ["5415448875811887735"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897212005294", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d1oObg-KJ0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
