The measured images were converted into the spectral intensity distributions at the central cross-section of the arc plasma by image processing and Abel inversion. The transient transport process of metal vapours inside the arc plasma are discussed in terms of the diffusion coefficients of metal vapour. The metal vapour generated from the weld pool surface was transported into the arc plasma and to the region near the tungsten electrode within a few seconds. As time passed, the metal vapour spectral intensities gradually increased near the weld pool surface, near the electrode and in the intermediate region. In contrast, the He I spectral intensity was weak and the He I distribution shrunk toward the centre of the arc. This is because the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3171155379649436666", "cites_id": ["3171155379649436666"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab9ce4/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-tuSKwQ1AiwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
