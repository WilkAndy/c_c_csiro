The SF 6-decomposition byproducts induced by the partial discharge are closely related to the insulation state of electrical equipment, so understanding the decomposition mechanisms of the byproducts is very important. In order to analyze the chemical processes and the generation mechanisms of the products of decomposition, two coupled 0D chemical kinetic models were developed and an experiment platform was established to verify the simulation results. The measured and predicted concentrations of SOF 2, SO 2 F 2 and SO 2 were compared and found to have a reasonable agreement. The time-dependent generation mechanisms of SOF 4 and HF were also predicted by the simulation model. The influence of moisture and oxygen impurities was examined; their presence increased the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12660993571755075290", "cites_id": ["12660993571755075290"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aacccd/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2ib3m5LitK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
