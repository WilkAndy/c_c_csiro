At the present experimental conditions, the metal transfer process was a spray transfer type with 100%Ar shielding gas. On the other hand, with 85%Ar + 15%CO2 shielding gas, the metal transfer process was a globular transfer type in which the arc length was shorter, the width was narrower and the time interval of the droplet separation was longer. For both shielding gases, the metal plasma region near the arc central axis exhibited 6500\u20137500 K, which was lower than the argon plasma region. With 85%Ar + 15%CO2 shielding gas, when the metal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4919653413330306551", "cites_id": ["4919653413330306551"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09507116.2016.1223220", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:90WXx7YeRkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
