In this paper, the influence of the choice of light source on measured photoconversion efficiencies for semiconductor photoelectrodes is examined. Measurements of efficiency performed under xenon lamp and solar illumination are compared with efficiencies calculated by integrating the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) over the lamp and solar spectra. It is shown that use of a xenon lamp as the light source can lead to a large overestimate of the photoconversion efficiency, relative to that obtained under standard AM1.5 solar illumination. The overestimate is greater when a water filter is fitted to the xenon lamp, and when a wide-band gap semiconductor such as TiO2 is used as the photoelectrode. Achievable photoconversion efficiencies using rutile TiO2 are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 941, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11068753886880697681", "cites_id": ["11068753886880697681"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319906000632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UY2_7QMdnJkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 14, "2008": 18, "2009": 28, "2010": 42, "2011": 47, "2012": 58, "2013": 64, "2014": 78, "2015": 93, "2016": 80, "2017": 88, "2018": 74, "2019": 66, "2020": 71, "2021": 50, "2022": 45, "2023": 19}}
