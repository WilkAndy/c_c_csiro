However, the mechanism of AGP-induced cancer cell death is unknown. In this study, AGP is shown to up-regulate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induce apoptosis in melanoma but not normal melanocyte cells. By screening genes involved in apoptosis, we identify tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013family members as the most differentially expressed cellular genes upon AGP treatment of melanoma cells. TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) antagonist\u2013neutralizing antibody specifically inhibits AGP-induced apoptosis signal, regulating apoptosis signal\u2013regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activity and subsequent ASK1-dependent apoptosis.
