The model couples the chemical kinetics occurring in high-temperature mixtures of iron vapour, oxygen and argon with a moment model of the nucleation and growth by condensation of iron and iron oxide nanoparticles. Results are presented for different iron vapour concentrations, oxygen-to-argon ratios, and quench rates. It is found that the presence of oxygen has important effects on the gas-phase chemistry and the properties of the nanoparticles. FeO nanoparticles are preferentially nucleated, and have smaller diameter than the Fe nanoparticles that are produced in the absence of oxygen. The final composition of the nanoparticles depends on the relative concentrations of iron and oxygen in the plasma.
