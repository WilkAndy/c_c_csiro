It takes into account the phenomena including (1) the motion of the arc relative to the workpiece; (2) the energy, momentum and mass transported by droplets; (3) flow in the weld pool and deformation of its surface; (4) effects of metal vapour and (5) mixing of the wire and workpiece alloys. A graphical user interface has been added. The model predicts the depth and shape of the weld and heat-affected zone and arc and weld pool properties. Thermal histories of the workpiece, required to calculate residual stress and microstructure, are also predicted. Results for welding of aluminium alloy sheets in lap fillet geometry are presented. It is found that the arc temperature is relatively low, due to the high concentration of aluminium vapour, which radiates strongly.
