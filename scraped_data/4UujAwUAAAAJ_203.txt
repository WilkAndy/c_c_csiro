The intense and controllable gas heating within the extremely small dimensions of microdischarges has been exploited in micro-thruster technologies by incorporating a micro-nozzle to generate the thrust. This kind of micro-thruster has a significantly improved specific impulse performance compared to conventional cold gas thrusters, and can meet the requirements arising from the emerging development and application of micro-spacecraft. In this paper, we performed a self-consistent 2D particle-in-cell simulation, with a Monte Carlo collision model, of a microdischarge operating in a prototype micro-plasma thruster with a hollow cylinder geometry and a divergent micro \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10276005078610242695", "cites_id": ["10276005078610242695"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aa623f/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h2yspCy0m44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
