Iron vapour can be easily introduced into the central region of such a welding arc due to melting of an electrode containing iron. The high radiation emission can produce several effects contrary to the usual behaviour of arcs in pure argon. Firstly, a central cylindrical core of iron vapour will be highly radiating and calculations show that the central core can consequently be at a lower temperature than the surrounding argon plasma. Because this central core has higher radiation emission it can give the appearance of having a higher central temperature. Secondly, it is predicted that radiation cooling of the arc due to iron vapour reduces the arc temperature and has the effect of increasing the arc \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3060924349002612001", "cites_id": ["3060924349002612001"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03266742", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:If2kWnqWeioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
