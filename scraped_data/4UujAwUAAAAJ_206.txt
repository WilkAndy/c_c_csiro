The specific surface area of the porous vanadium/titanium oxides increased with increasing vanadium content to a maximum of 72 m2 g\u20131 at 6.6 at-% V, with a corresponding decrease in anatase crystal size (minimum of 12.4 nm), and c-axis lattice parameter (0.9475 nm). The optical band-gap decreased substantially from 3.10 eV for TiO2 to 2.53 eV on the addition of 9.7 at-% V. The adsorption capability of the oxides for aqueous methylene blue (pH ~6) increased significantly with increasing vanadium content (26.7 to 318.9 mg L\u20131 g\u20131 for 0 to 9.7 at-% V). The photodegradation of methylene blue was most efficient with the 0.9 at-% V-TiO2 sample for both UV and visible light irradiation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11990434754113187616", "cites_id": ["11990434754113187616"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch06405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IC9qfeGUZqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
