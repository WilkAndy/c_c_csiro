The three-gas combined diffusion coefficient method is used to treat diffusion of helium, argon, and iron vapour. Calculations for argon\u2013helium mixtures without metal vapour are performed; good agreement with previous numerical results is found. A transition from a helium-like to an argon-like arc occurs when the argon mole fraction increases above about 0.3. Calculations for a wide range of argon\u2013helium mixtures including iron vapour are then performed. Adding helium to argon alters the arc properties and affects the weld geometry. Iron vapour cools the arc for all argon\u2013helium mixtures. Iron vapour is present above the workpiece, near the cathode and in the arc fringes for very low argon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5023288116728723625", "cites_id": ["5023288116728723625"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40194-020-01053-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qXgOeu1NtkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
