Metal vapour emanating from the weld pool has important effects on the arc welding process. An axisymmetric computational model of the arc and weld pool is used to examine the transport and influence of iron vapour on an argon arc plasma. In contrast to previous studies that use approximate and incomplete treatments of diffusion, the present model incorporates the combined diffusion coefficient method, which takes into account all important driving forces. The influence of metal vapour is first examined for an arc current of 400 A. Metal vapour is predicted to be present in high concentrations above the anode and near the cathode tip, and in a lower concentration in the arc column. The presence of metal vapour in the arc is found to lead to a substantial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18269921637831081790", "cites_id": ["18269921637831081790"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab51f3/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pv8kce7Mi_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
