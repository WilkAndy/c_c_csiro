In this work, both an open-air ablation test and an interrupted burning test are conducted for three different propellants. A fused silica window, which is transparent in all relevant wavelengths, is utilized to investigate the role of the plasma radiation. Surface pitting of the propellants after interaction with the plasma is analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effect of pits on the plasma ignition is then studied and a possible formation mechanism of pits is proposed. The input heat flux and the surface temperature of the propellants are obtained by solving a pre-ignition plasma\u2013propellant interaction model. The results shed light on the pre-ignition plasma ignition mechanisms and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3330012703183723771", "cites_id": ["3330012703183723771"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/49/7/075201/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-9zNDumUNi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
