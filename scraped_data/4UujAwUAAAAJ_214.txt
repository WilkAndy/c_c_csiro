The influence of helium content in a ternary shielding gas (Ar\u2013CO2\u2013He) mixture on arc properties, metal transfer process, and weld bead profile was investigated by numerical simulation and experimental study. As the helium content increases, the arc temperature field becomes more constricted but the central high-temperature zone expands. The current density on the arc axis increases with increasing helium content. The heat flux density on the cathode increases as the helium content increases. The changes in the arc properties lead to the changes in the metal transfer. With increasing helium content, the droplet size increases and the transfer frequency decreases, with approximately linear dependence on helium content. When the helium content is increased from 0 to 25 vol%, the droplet diameter increases by about 80% and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1679721675138936468", "cites_id": ["1679721675138936468"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40194-018-0631-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lC4uyPaRTxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
