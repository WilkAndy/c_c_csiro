The pre-arcing time and arc voltage are related to the channel diameter and prospective current. The electrode erosion is analyzed, and an efficient method is proposed to reduce this phenomenon."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=588498692030505126", "cites_id": ["588498692030505126"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5934436/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pqBCQXHEKggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
