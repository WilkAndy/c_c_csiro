A feature of our work is that the electrode, arc plasma and workpiece are all included in the computational domain, and are treated self-consistently. We demonstrate the importance of including the arc plasma in the computational domain with three examples. First, we have examined the influence of the shielding gas composition on the arc and weld pool properties, and have related this to the thermophysical properties of the gas. This research has allowed improved shielding gases and welding processes to be developed. In a second example, the vaporisation of the weld pool metal, and the diffusion of the vapour into the arc plasma, have been simulated. The effect of the metal vapour can be very significant. It cools the plasma through increased radiative emission, and decreases the current density to the workpiece through increased electrical conductivity at lower temperatures. These effects in turn strongly influence the weld pool properties. Finally, we have investigated the influence of the electrode shape. Again we find that the effect on the arc parameters, and consequently the weld pool, is substantial."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=95609574390556559", "cites_id": ["95609574390556559"], "pub_url": "https://flair.monash.edu/intranet/proceedings/cfd2009/PDFs/066MUR.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j-esvmasUwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
