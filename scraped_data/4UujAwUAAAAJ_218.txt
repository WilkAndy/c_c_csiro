We have been able to consider important phenomena for the first time by developing a unified numerical simulation model incorporating relevant sub-models. These include the absorption of the radiant energy due to blackening of the lamp and the temporal variation in the lamp parameters. The validity of the numerical simulation model is first evaluated by comparison with experimental results. The basic characteristics of the lamp obtained using the model is found to be in good agreement with the experimental results and other research results. The influence of the bulb wall blackening is then examined. The temperature of the bulb is shown strongly affected by convective heat transfer from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5950549267000362096", "cites_id": ["5950549267000362096"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab257d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cIQE7geZlFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
