Attention is focused on the population of excited states of atomic iron as a result of excitation, de-excitation, ionization, recombination and spontaneous emission. Effective rate coefficients for ionization and recombination, required in non-equilibrium plasma transport models, are also obtained. The collisional-radiative model is applied to a thermal arc plasma. Input parameters for the collisional-radiative model are provided by a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a gas-metal welding arc, in which local thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed and the treatment of the transport of metal vapour is based on combined diffusion coefficients. The results clearly identify the conditions in the arc, under which the atomic state distribution satisfies the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15600172487414630286", "cites_id": ["15600172487414630286"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aa7090/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jscrWznyftgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
