As a consequence, numerous thermal-plasma-based processes have been developed to, for example, destroy pollutants, modify surfaces (eg cutting and welding), synthesize nanostructures and deposit functionalized nanostructured coatings. In many cases, departures from equilibrium (both thermal and chemical) occur in regions of such plasmas; for example, in electrode erosion phenomena or in the injection of a liquid into a plasma jet. This paper reviews the treatment of non-equilibrium phenomena in thermal plasma flows, in particular the methods of calculation of the composition and transport coefficients of non-equilibrium plasmas, which are required for modelling the above processes. The focus is on two-temperature plasmas, in which electrons and heavy species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13132539542557388193", "cites_id": ["13132539542557388193"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/41/18/183001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oW3ngCInQLYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 12, "2010": 6, "2011": 15, "2012": 17, "2013": 20, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 16, "2017": 17, "2018": 15, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
