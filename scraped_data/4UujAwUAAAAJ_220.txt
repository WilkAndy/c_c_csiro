The mathematical model of 3-dimentional air arc plasma considering the ablation of lateral walls is built based on magnetic hydro-dynamics (MHD). By adopting the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package based on control-volume method, the above MHD model is solved and the distribution of temperature field, concentration field, flow field and electrical potential field in the arc chamber are calculated. The simulation results indicate that the vapor concentration behind the arc column is higher than that in front of the arc column because of the existence of"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11258052957803589720,4384871555167831960", "cites_id": ["11258052957803589720", "4384871555167831960"], "pub_url": "https://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e91-c_8_1240", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WDBrdISjPJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
