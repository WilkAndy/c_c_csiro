Two effects are shown to contribute to this; first, demixing, which concentrates helium in the high-temperature region near the center of the arc, and second the fact that the radiative emission from helium, relative to that from argon, increases with temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3649246206494949785", "cites_id": ["3649246206494949785"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/763013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mcESHBe6pDIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
