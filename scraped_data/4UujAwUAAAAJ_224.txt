This is despite the solidification conditions being observed to be highly unsteady and non-equilibrium. These two assumptions lead to inaccurate predictions of the temperature evolution of the molten pool and thus microstructure predictions. To demonstrate this, an approach to scale-bridging computational models of the laser additive manufacturing process is presented, in which the temperature history is passed from a macroscale molten pool simulation to a microscale phase-field simulation. This linkage is achieved by volume mapping of the temperature field from the grid of the molten pool simulation to the grid of the microstructure simulation.
