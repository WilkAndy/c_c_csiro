A metal\u2013dielectric\u2013metal sandwich configuration, consisting of two molybdenum foils with slit openings of different lengths at the anode, separated by mica layers of different thicknesses d, was used in this study. The measurements were performed in carbon dioxide under pressures from 4 to 40 Torr. It was found that although breakdown curves in carbon dioxide generally follow the conventional Paschen's law, significant deviations occurred for the different cases in this study. The deviations may be due to the non-uniformity of electric field and the loss of charge carriers by diffusion to the inner wall of the slit. Current\u2013voltage characteristics of the micro-slit discharge for different slit lengths and different pressures are presented.
