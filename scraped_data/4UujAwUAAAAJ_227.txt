This paper is devoted to investigating the non-equilibrium characteristics of CO2 thermal plasmas, which have wide application in industry. A two-temperature chemical kinetic model with a comprehensive chemical system is developed to calculate the non-equilibrium characteristics of CO2 thermal plasmas for a wide temperature range, from 12,000 to 500 K, at atmospheric pressure. The non-equilibrium results are compared to the equilibrium composition obtained by Gibbs free energy minimization, and significant deviations are found at lower temperatures. Based on the dependence of molar fractions on temperature, the dominant species are determined in three temperature ranges. The dominant reactions are then obtained by considering their contribution to the generation and loss of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11521936193008571938", "cites_id": ["11521936193008571938"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-016-9719-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ihb-9Osj5p8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
