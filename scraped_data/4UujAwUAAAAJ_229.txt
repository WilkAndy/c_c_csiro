The distributions of temperature and mass fraction of iron vapor are calculated. The simulation results indicate that the arc splitting process is strongly influenced by the presence of iron vapor from the splitter plate. Images of arc simulation results are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13915912307077528782", "cites_id": ["13915912307077528782"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5960798/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zrzXfINAH8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
