The characteristics of the device are described. During the first phase of operation, 70 GHz ECF was used to generate and heat a'currentless' plasma which was maintained in quasi-steady state for typically 0.5 s. Effects of the magnetic configuration on the confinement and measures to deal with the observed plasma current (bootstrap current and ECF-driven current) were investigated. Preliminary results of transport analysis are presented and compared with predictions of transport models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4889172158145852428,10399709083804681460", "cites_id": ["4889172158145852428", "10399709083804681460"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0741-3335/31/10/008/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DHQDhCzU2UMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 7, "1991": 5, "1992": 9, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 11, "1996": 7, "1997": 6, "1998": 13, "1999": 10, "2000": 6, "2001": 7, "2002": 10, "2003": 10, "2004": 7, "2005": 10, "2006": 1, "2007": 9, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
