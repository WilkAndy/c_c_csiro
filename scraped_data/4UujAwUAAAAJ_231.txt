Especially, in order to consider the effect of chemical reaction between the arc plasma and the surface of the anode material, non-equilibrium property of the arc plasma should be considered without the LTE assumption, since it is required to understand precise property of the arc plasma close to the anode surface. Therefore, we have developed non-equilibrium simulation model of GTA. In this paper, the reliability of the model was confirmed for comparing the simulation result with the experimental result. Furthermore, it was found that the thickness of non-equilibrium region in case of 150A is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9518755049554778488", "cites_id": ["9518755049554778488"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897210004755", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eBmr-EhpGYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
