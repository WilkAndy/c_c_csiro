Particular attention is paid to the PLASCON process, based on an argon plasma produced by a dc plasma torch, which is used to destroy halons and chlorofluorocarbons in Australia and the UK. Three different approaches to modelling the destruction of ozone-depleting substances in a thermal plasma are presented: chemical equilibrium, chemical kinetic and fluid dynamic. Chemical equilibrium modelling does not accurately predict the products of the destruction process; however, the equilibrium mixing temperature is shown to be well correlated with the destruction and removal efficiency. The ratio of the feed rate to the plasma power also predicts the destruction and removal efficiency for a given oxidising gas. Chemical kinetic calculations are shown to give a good prediction of the products of the destruction process, while fluid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12952753405296534373", "cites_id": ["12952753405296534373"], "pub_url": "https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/57d172397126f956,199003e25b68b21b,1bf408ca2592adb6.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZWPucZhswbMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
