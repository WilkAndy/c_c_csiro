Electricity-driven plasma catalysis is receiving increasing attention as a sustainable technology for the efficient synthesis of ammonia. However, the current implementation of nonthermal plasma technology still faces several hurdles, particularly the extensive usage of energy-intensive H2, low energy efficiency and the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the plasma catalysis process. Here we propose a green chemical pathway of plasma catalysis from nitrogen and water for sustainable ammonia production. In order to understand the different characteristics of the N2/H2O plasma system and seek further improvements in ammonia synthesis, detailed plasma kinetics modelling is presented in comparison with the N2/H2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6921323951567754788", "cites_id": ["6921323951567754788"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/gc/d2gc02299k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JFaZlHZ7DWAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
