Unlike the calculation of LTE plasma composition, the calculation of 2T plasma composition still remains in dispute. Different researchers have chosen different methods which lead to different results. In this work, we compare two kinds of methods for calculating 2T plasma composition: the mass action law methods and extremum searching methods. The former methods include the two described by Potapov and van de Sanden et al mass action laws, respectively. The latter methods include those of searching minimum Gibbs free energy and maximum entropy of a plasma system respectively. The entropy maximization method is first reported in this work and has the same power as the commonly used Gibbs free energy minimization method. We demonstrate both mathematically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12085168973804151865", "cites_id": ["12085168973804151865"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab572d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OSQr1iYlt6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
