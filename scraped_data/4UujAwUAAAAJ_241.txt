The model takes into account formation of the particles from metal vapour by nucleation, growth of the particles by condensation of metal vapour and coagulation of the particles by collisions to form secondary particles. Results are obtained for both ballistic and Brownian motion of the particles. It is found that the growth of secondary particles is suppressed when the average particle charge becomes significant, because charging of the particle hinders collisions among secondary particles through the strong repulsive electrostatic force. Furthermore, deviations from LTE strongly affect the coagulation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7428215227272490590", "cites_id": ["7428215227272490590"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/46/22/224007/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xm65kGRSFmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
