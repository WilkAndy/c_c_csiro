The arc plasma is coupled with the electrodes self-consistently in the computational domain. The self-consistent effective binary diffusion coefficient approximation treatment of diffusion and a generalized form of Ohm's law are incorporated in the model. It is found the electric field has to undergo a reversal in front of the anode to preserve current conservation due to the strong diffusion current density. No field reversal is found in front of the cathode. The detailed chemical reaction processes are analyzed to understand the species density behaviour. Along the cathode surface, the maximum values of current density and heat flux density occur at the intersection of the flat tip and the conical surface. The distributions of different components of the current density and heat flux density change with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1298604171561250207", "cites_id": ["1298604171561250207"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/abb6a9/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n62_HZ2RBRIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
