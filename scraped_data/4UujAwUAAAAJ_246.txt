Simulation of these processes relies on accurate plasma property data, such as plasma composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients. Departures from LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) generally occur in some regions of helium plasmas. In this paper, properties are calculated allowing for different values of the electron temperature, T e, and heavy-species temperature, T h, at atmospheric pressure from 300 K to 30 000 K. The plasma composition is first calculated using the mass action law, and the two-temperature thermodynamic properties are then derived. The viscosity, diffusion coefficients, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the two-temperature helium thermal plasma are obtained using a recently-developed method that retains coupling between electrons and heavy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2720682610090336192", "cites_id": ["2720682610090336192"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aa5d25/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wF8ESWvOwSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1}}
