Computational modeling can assist with filling in some of these gaps by increasing in-depth understanding of these relationships and highlighting cause-and-effect. Additionally, it can capture the knowledge of materials scientists and engineers and apply established physics-based rules to simulate the processes and thus predict the final outcomes. Modeling can also help optimize processes. Some even predict that future generations of additive manufacturing machines will employ \u2018model-assisted feed forward algorithms\u2019 that would leapfrog feedback control methods.
