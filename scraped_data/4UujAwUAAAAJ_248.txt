A 3D large eddy simulation model of a non-transferred direct current hybrid water/argon plasma torch issuing in nitrogen atmosphere at 400 K was developed to compare three different models for the calculation of transport and thermodynamic properties of the ternary gas mixture. In the first model, thermodynamic and transport properties of the pure gases are used with mixing rules to estimate the mixture properties. In the second model, the properties of plasma gas (Ar/H2O) are calculated rigorously and mixing rules are used for estimating the properties of the mixture of plasma gas and nitrogen. In the third model, the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ternary gas mixture are calculated rigorously without any mixing rules.
