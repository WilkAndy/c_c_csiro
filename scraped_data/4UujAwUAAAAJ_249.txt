The successful production of the nanotubes and graphene in a single process was achieved by using a magnetically enhanced arc discharge in helium atmosphere between carbon and metal electrodes. A 3-D fluid model has been used to investigate the discharge parameters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12707740140510594087", "cites_id": ["12707740140510594087"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5782998/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J0QbTVT2WrAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
