In this study, we introduce a newly built experimental setup for pulsed Townsend measurements as well as the physical model for the acquisition of electron swarm parameters. The effective ionization rate coefficients, electron drift velocity, and density-normalized longitudinal diffusion coefficients in C4F7N and its mixtures with CO2 and N2 were obtained. The reduced critical electric field for pure C4F7N at 100\u2009Pa is determined to be 1002 Td, while it decreases with increasing pressure because of the effect of ion kinetics during the discharge process. C4F7N shows good synergism with CO2 and N2. To have a dielectric strength equivalent to that of SF6, the mixing ratio of C4F7N in its mixtures with CO2 and N2 should be 18% and 12%, respectively.
