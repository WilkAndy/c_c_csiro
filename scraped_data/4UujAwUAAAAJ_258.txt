The boundary conditions are for the electric potential, the two energy equations for electrons and heavy particles (ions and neutrals), and the two mass conservation equations for the working gas and the vapour of the wall material. In these boundary conditions, the plasma sheath formed at the wall is viewed as the interface between the plasma and the wall, the plasma composition is assumed to be determined by a generalized Saha equation adapted to the case , and the reactive gas is assumed to form a stoichiometric film at the wall. The derived boundary conditions allow the calculation of the heat flux from the plasma to the wall, the thermionic electron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18165018343675320979", "cites_id": ["18165018343675320979"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/49/37/375202/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k9o48fAbF_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
