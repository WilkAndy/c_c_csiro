Arcs in mixtures of argon with helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are modeled. It is found that demixing almost always has a large influence on arc composition, with the greatest changes occurring in the argon-helium and argon-hydrogen arcs. The influence of three different demixing processes is assessed. Demixing due to frictional forces is found to dominate in the high-temperature regions of the arc, while demixing due to mole fraction gradients is important in the regions where dissociation of the molecular gases occurs. Demixing due to thermal diffusion has a smaller effect. The effects of demixing on arc temperature and flow velocity are usually small. The heat flux to the anode is significantly increased near the axis by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8967071420377075814", "cites_id": ["8967071420377075814"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.55.7473", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZhAif_JvcXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 7, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 7, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 10, "2007": 14, "2008": 12, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
