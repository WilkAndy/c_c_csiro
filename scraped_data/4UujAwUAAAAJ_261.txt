Based on principles of calculating thermodynamic properties of arc plasmas, the species compositions of nitrogen and argon arc plasmas in equilibrium state as a function of temperature and pressure are obtained and the relevant statistic thermodynamic properties are further presented, where the thermodynamic properties of nitrogen and argon arc plasmas under different pressure conditions (0.01, 0.10, 0.30, 0.50 and 1.00 MPa) and in different temperature range (300~ 40000 K) are demonstrated and compared with previous literatures. It is shown that the statistic thermodynamic properties results in the temperature range of lower than 15000 K are in good agreement \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12062977863295932100", "cites_id": ["12062977863295932100"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP114419&sb=RECENT&n=9&rpp=10&page=371&tr=5096&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xJYnS3ROaKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
