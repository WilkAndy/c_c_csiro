While the influence of metal vapour has long been recognized, it is only recently that diagnostic and computational tools have been sufficiently well-developed to allow this influence to be more thoroughly examined and understood. Some unexpected findings have resulted: for example, that the presence of metal vapour in gas\u2013metal arc welding leads to local minima in the temperature and current density in the centre of the arc. It has become clear that the presence of metal vapour, as well as having intrinsic scientific interest, plays an important role in determining the values of critical parameters in industrial applications, such as the weld penetration in arc welding and the extinction time in circuit breakers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8226279134871654124", "cites_id": ["8226279134871654124"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/43/430301/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7I472UmdKXIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
