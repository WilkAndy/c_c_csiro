Sodium was selected as the alkaline element, and a standard wire without sodium (wire 1) and three wires with 0.028, 0.056, and 0.084 mass% sodium (wire 2, 3, and 4) were prototyped. They were observed using a high-speed video camera equipped with laser illumination, which clarified that the droplet transfer frequency tended to increase proportionally with the amount of sodium added. Subsequently, the line spectra of the iron atom (particularly the Fe I 537.1 nm line) and sodium atom (particularly the Na I 589.0 nm line) were primarily observed using a bandpass filter. Iron vapor evaporated from the droplet bottom, while sodium vapor mainly evaporated from the molten wire tip or the neck between the wire and the droplet because of its low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16082123299784018254", "cites_id": ["16082123299784018254"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612521004746", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TsmoNe8tL98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
