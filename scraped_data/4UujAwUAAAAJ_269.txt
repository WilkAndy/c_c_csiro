The analysis consisted of building a map of the dominant mechanisms for heating and cooling the arc in each zone as well as their relative importance in terms of volumetric power. It was found that the primary inputs of energy are due to convection near the anode and Joule heating near the cathode, while the main cooling mechanisms have a complex structure that can be described in the map from cathode to anode, composed of Thomson effect, convection, radiation and conduction. A systematic analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the arc current, arc length, and plasma gas on the map of dominant mechanisms. The gases considered were Ar and He. The main effect of current is on the intensities and extent of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17036941844478448675", "cites_id": ["17036941844478448675"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-021-10192-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I1Qgi1dgb-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
