These models predict temperatures above 20 000 K and a temperature distribution similar to GTAW arcs. However, spectroscopic temperature measurements in GMAW arcs demonstrate much lower arc temperatures. In contrast to measurements of GTAW arcs, they have shown the presence of a central local minimum of the radial temperature distribution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17123586574774913374", "cites_id": ["17123586574774913374"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/43/434008/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xkkb3kMzo-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 13, "2013": 17, "2014": 11, "2015": 12, "2016": 18, "2017": 14, "2018": 17, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
