However, highly transient physical phenomena that occur in these processes at different length scales are difficult to observe. Challenging and costly experiments are usually needed to obtain data for process understanding and improvement. Computational modelling of powder-bed fusion processes is therefore important from several points of view. These include better process understanding, optimisation of process parameters and component designs, prediction of component properties, qualification of components and to assist process control. Several physical processes have to be treated to develop a complete model, namely the raking of the powder bed surface, the transfer of energy from the laser or electron beam to the metal, the melting and solidification of the powder, the flow of liquid metal in the melt pool, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=342924748446670757", "cites_id": ["342924748446670757"], "pub_url": "https://www.scientific.net/MSF.1016.1031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pZ_a5z1QwgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
