The aluminium\u2013silicon alloy AA4043 is used for the wire electrode, and the aluminium\u2013magnesium alloy AA5754 for the workpiece. Detailed thermophysical property data for aluminium\u2013silicon\u2013magnesium alloys are given. Modelling results are presented for lap geometry, including different electrode angles, and for bead-on-plate geometry. It is found that the filler metal is concentrated in the region near the boundary of the fusion zone and the base metal. This concentration occurs because of the convective flow of the filler metal towards this boundary, which is in turn driven by the momentum transferred to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9423073318470879812", "cites_id": ["9423073318470879812"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612520307660", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RArr70F7xYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
