To achieve this, a novel welding torch with a dual gas nozzle has been developed. This special welding torch decreases the hydrogen source gas evaporated from a welding wire by the suction from the inner gas nozzle. In order to improve the suction efficiency of this evaporated gas, precise control of the suction gas flow is indispensable. In this paper, a simplified numerical simulation model of this process has been described. This model can take account of the evaporation of the hydrogen source gas from the wire while simulating the behavior of the shielding gas and the arc. Using this model, the effect of suction nozzle structure and torch operating conditions on suction gas flow pattern and suction efficiency was also investigated to understand the process mechanism. Furthermore, the diffusible hydrogen content in deposited metal was measured by chromatography as a validation step. Results show that some of the shielding gas introduced from a shielding nozzle was drawn inward and also branched into an upward flow that was sucked into the suction nozzle and a downward flow to a base metal. This branching height was defined as the suction limit height, which decisively governed the suction efficiency. As a result, in order to reduce the diffusible hydrogen, it was suggested that the suction limit height should be controlled towards below the wire position, where the evaporation rate of the hydrogen source gas peaks through optimization of the suction nozzle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15523544731495125863", "cites_id": ["15523544731495125863"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/679904", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z1Onn6-1btcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
