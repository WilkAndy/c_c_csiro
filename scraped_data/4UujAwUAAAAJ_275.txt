The diffusion of plasma species itself is described by the combined diffusion coefficients method in which the coefficients describe the diffusion of argon'gas,'with respect to water vapor'gas.'Diffusion processes due to the gradients of mass density, temperature, pressure, and an electric field have been considered in the model. Calculations for currents 150\u2013400 A with 15\u201322.5 standard liters per minute (slm) of argon reveal inhomogeneous mixing of argon and oxygen\u2013hydrogen species with the argon species prevailing near the arc axis. All the combined diffusion coefficients exhibit highly nonlinear distribution of their values within the discharge, depending on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5636264996025683765", "cites_id": ["5636264996025683765"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aa9f6f/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NU8U1CYJOE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
