In the condition of 1 % nitrogen-mixed shielding gas, nitrogen content of weld metal in a helium arc or an argon-hydrogen arc decreased compared to that of an argon arc. These changes in nitrogen content had a strong correlation with arc voltages for the respective shielding gases, so it was considered that nitrogen absorption in weld metal was affected by arc plasma heat source characteristics. The spectroscopic measurements of these arcs showed that the plasma temperature near the molten pool surface in the helium arc or the argon-hydrogen arc indicated around 6,500 K, while the plasma temperature in the argon arc achieved more than 10,000 K.
