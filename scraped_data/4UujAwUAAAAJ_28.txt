A key component of these models will be a detailed simulation of flow and heat transfer in and around the melt pool formed as the powder bed is melted. This paper reviews the burgeoning literature concerning melt pool simulation. The physical theory underlying the current benchmark models is first presented and the main approximations and assumptions discussed. The individual capabilities of the leading simulation groups around the world are listed in detail. Publications by less prominent research groups are also summarised. Finally, the overall status of melt pool simulation and the implications for model development are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 140, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5444678820821076450", "cites_id": ["5444678820821076450"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214860419305731", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4gkiV4pij0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 12, "2021": 51, "2022": 47, "2023": 28}}
