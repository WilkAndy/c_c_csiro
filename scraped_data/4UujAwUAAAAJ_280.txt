The whole region of gas tungsten arc welding, namely the tungsten cathode, arc plasma and weld pool, is treated using a unified numerical model. A viscosity approximation is used to express the diffusion coefficient in terms of the viscosities of the argon gas and the iron vapor. The time-dependent two-dimensional distributions of temperature, velocity and iron vapor concentration are predicted, together with the weld penetration as function of time for a 150 A arc at atmospheric pressure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1710129552125819114", "cites_id": ["1710129552125819114"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/52391418/Numerical_Simulation_of_Metal_Vapor_Beha20170330-28664-1jw5jsl.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6nhbWsSZuxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
