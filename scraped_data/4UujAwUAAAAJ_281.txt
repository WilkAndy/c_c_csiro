However, during the H-phase, which lasts for a few hundred milliseconds, the increasing density induces a variation in the loading resistance. This is reasonably accounted for in terms of an eigenmode effect, and is in agreement with theoretical predictions.(2) In long-pulse second-harmonic heating experiments a slowly changing isotope concentration (H concentration from 70% to 85%) is accompanied by a gradual decrease in loading resistance.(3) In 2 Omega CH heating experiments with repetitive pellet refueling, in which two confinement phases have been identified, it has been observed that the temporal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9150661224134507993", "cites_id": ["9150661224134507993"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0741-3335/33/2/005/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2X16rOat_X4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
