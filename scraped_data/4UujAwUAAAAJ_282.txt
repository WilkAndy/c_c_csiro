Educ. January 1986 21 14-18) S Brusca perpetrates several common misapplications of Bernoulli\u2019s equation. For example, it is claimed that a ping-pong ball suspended in mid-air by a blower is forced back into \u2018the low pressure region in the flow\u2019when it starts to fall into the region of \u2018normal atmospheric pressure outside of the flow\u2019. Bernoulli\u2019s equation is claimed to imply that a stream of moving air will be of lower pressure than the surrounding stationary air. Bernoulli\u2019s equation is a statement of the conservation of energy of a single stream of fluid. It may not be applied in cases where there is a source or a sink of energy. Thus, there is no justification for claiming that a jet of air will be of reduced pressure simply because it is moving. The kinetic energy of the air jet comes from the mechanical work done by the machine producing it, not from a reduction in pressure, or potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6149025954168820506", "cites_id": ["6149025954168820506"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9120/21/5/104/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GtPjwIa6VVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
