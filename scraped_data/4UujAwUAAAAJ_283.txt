The novel expressions capture the main magnetohydrodynamic arc characteristics (temperature, velocity, magnetic field) and also yield the main arc\u2013weld-pool interactions (heat flux, current density and pressure). The proposed correlations are validated against numerical results presented in this work and numerical and experimental results found in the literature. Simulated electric arcs conditions considered include arc currents and arc lengths in the range of 200\u2013300 A and 5\u201310 mm respectively, burning in Ar and Ar-He mixtures and arc lengths ranging from 7\u201310 mm for He."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4346058125971472567", "cites_id": ["4346058125971472567"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/abbfc7/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t8C609ZMUDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
