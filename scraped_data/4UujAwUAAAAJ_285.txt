For plasmas in contact with a metal cathode, a sheath of positive ions is formed over the cathode surface because electrons move away from the cathode. A sheath thickness of only 0.1 \u00b5m causes secondary electrons produced at the cathode surface to gain~ 12 V. The electron transit through this thin sheath is collision-less. These 12 V electrons produce excited states of atoms to a distance of approximately~ 10 \u00b5m from the cathode. Diffusion and direct transfer of these excited atoms back to the cathode in the almost collision free region next to the cathode is calculated to be in times of~ 10\u2212 8 s. This time is less than the radiative lifetimes of almost all atomic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11670787619908359204", "cites_id": ["11670787619908359204"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab3700/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JBSqfYH39qEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
