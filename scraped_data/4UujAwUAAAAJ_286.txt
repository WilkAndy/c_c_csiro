Capillary discharge plasmas have been widely used as electrothermal chemical (ETC) launch devices, fusion reactor pellet injectors and high heat flux sources for material studies. In the electro thermal chemical launcher, the mechanisms of the plasma-propellant interaction are critical, with many factors being of potential importance. In particular, the role of plasma radiation is disputed. We will report the effect of three different metal ions and radiation in the capillary discharge plasma on the plasma-propellant interactions. Conventionally, a capillary initiated by a metal wire of about 2 mg and with an ablative liner material (e.g. polyethylene) is used as the plasma generator. The plasma is mainly composed of CO, H + , C, etc. The proportion of metal ions was negligible. We have designed a new capillary discharge plasma generator with different metal powders of higher weight as the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2742266030873271511", "cites_id": ["2742266030873271511"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7534393/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:11zSCW18DiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
