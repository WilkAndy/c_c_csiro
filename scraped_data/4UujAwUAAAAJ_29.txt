The highly reactive electrons, ions, atoms, and radicals in the plasma significantly enhance the chemical kinetics, allowing ammonia to be produced at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. However, despite the promise of plasma catalysis, its performance is still well short of that of the Haber\u2013Bosch process. This is at least in part due to the lack of understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the plasma\u2013catalyst interactions. Gaining such an understanding is a prerequisite for exploiting the potential of plasma catalysis for ammonia production. In this perspective, we discuss possible benefits and synergies of the combination of plasma and catalyst.
