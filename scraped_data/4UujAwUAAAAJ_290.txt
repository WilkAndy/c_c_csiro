Their many applications can be divided into those that require relatively low power (of the order of kilowatts), such as arc welding, plasma cutting, plasma spraying and arc lighting, and those that typically operate at much high powers (in some cases up to several megawatts), including mineral processing, waste treatment and nanoparticle production [1]. The lower-power applications have the advantage, from the development viewpoint, that experimental systems are of approximately the same design, size and power as industrial systems. In contrast, laboratory experiments for the high-power applications typically use orders-of-magnitude less power than industrial systems.The subject of this special issue is the three small-scale thermal plasma applications that are most important in manufacturing: arc welding, plasma cutting and plasma spraying. All are well-established industrial technologies, with long histories and widespread implementation. Nevertheless, they remain the subject of continuing research and development, focussed on both improvement of existing processes, and development of relatively new variants, such as laser\u2013arc hybrid welding, and suspension and solution plasma spraying. In all three applications, an arc plasma is struck between two electrodes, typically at or close to atmospheric pressure. In arc welding and plasma cutting, the arc is transferred to a metal workpiece. In welding, the workpiece consists of two pieces of metal, which are partially melted and joined by the arc. In cutting, the power transferred by the arc, augmented in some cases by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9684149817148900133", "cites_id": ["9684149817148900133"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javad-Mostaghimi-2/publication/258261435_Arc_welding_plasma_cutting_and_plasma_spraying_PREFACE/links/55c89c8308aeca747d66efdf/Arc-welding-plasma-cutting-and-plasma-spraying-PREFACE.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JQPTKvMCZYYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
