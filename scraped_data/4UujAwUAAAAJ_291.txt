The reflection of light by the substrate was specifically considered and it was found that, depending on the incident angle and the polarization of the incident light, the reflected light can strongly affect the absorption efficiency of the nanoparticles. Therefore, the reflection plays an important role in the nanoparticle heating process. Heat transfer from the nanoparticles to the substrate was also investigated and it was found that the temperature of the nanoparticles and substrate is largest when the contact area between them is minimized."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4906032994323685558", "cites_id": ["4906032994323685558"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6045217/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tmAC2wO7FUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
