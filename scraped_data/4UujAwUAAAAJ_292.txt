A fume formation model consisting of a heterogeneous condensation model, a homogeneous nucleation model and a coagulation model has been developed and coupled with a TIG welding model. A series of processes from setting arc operation conditions to generation of metal vapor and fume formation from the metal vapor is totally investigated by employing this simulation model. This paper aims to visualize the fume formation process and clarify the fume formation mechanism theoretically through numerical analysis. Furthermore, the reliability of the simulation model was also evaluated through comparison of the simulation result with experimental result. As a result, it was found that the size of the secondary particle consisting of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16024638677098085442,16294410526548281464", "cites_id": ["16024638677098085442", "16294410526548281464"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP107186&sb=RECENT&n=25&rpp=50&page=6&tr=5481&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QrxqgvnzYt4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
