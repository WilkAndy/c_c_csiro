The wave fields excited by Faraday shielded antennas with current elements oriented in the poloidal direction were measured by an array of magnetic probes positioned along a vertical diameter of the plasma. Pronounced enhancement of the wave fields at the radii of Alfv\u00e9n resonance surfaces was observed. The dependence of the wave field profiles on the plasma parameters and on the toroidal and poloidal positions is analysed with the help of a simple theoretical model. Evidence of the excitation of the outward propagating surface electrostatic wave is presented. The profiles excited by a number of phasings of an array of three toroidally spaced antennas are compared.
