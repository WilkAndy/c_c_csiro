In this paper, the dielectric breakdown properties of CO2\u2013O2 mixtures at different O2 concentrations and gas pressures were studied theoretically by considering ion kinetics in a spatial\u2013temporal growth avalanche model. A kinetic scheme that includes all the main reactions likely to occur in CO2\u2013O2 mixtures is presented. An improved method to calculate the dielectric strength of the gas mixture is developed, based on an avalanche model that considers both spatial growth and temporal processes. Next, the reaction rates of ionization, attachment, detachment and ion conversion, the effective ionization Townsend coefficient \u03b1eff/N, and reduced critical electric field strength (E/N)cr in CO2\u2013O2 mixtures at different mixing ratios and gas pressures are analyzed in detail. Finally, a pulsed Townsend \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6384766938630279292", "cites_id": ["6384766938630279292"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0093568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fFC35rM_m1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
