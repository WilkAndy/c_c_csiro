In this process, the proper selection of the shielding gas plays a vital role in the achievement of structurally acceptable part geometries and quality surface finishes. In this study, the authors used either a ternary mix (He, Ar and CO2) or a binary mix (Ar and CO2) of shielding gases to deposit wall geometries using an open loop-controlled WAAM system developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. The binary blend produced a wider and shorter geometry, while the ternary blend resulted in a narrower build that was more equivalent to the CAD geometry. The data indicated that the binary blend provided a higher oxygen concentration in the weld as compared to that of the ternary blend. The results imply that the arc characteristics and heat input had a significantly higher impact on the weld penetration than the surface tension effect of surface active elements. This was further verified by developing and applying a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the thermophysical properties of gas mixtures. The results from the model showed that, while the influence of increased oxygen concentration on the surface tension for the binary blend led to a deeper penetration, the ternary blend gave rise to heat flux to the workpiece."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3326192162982213764", "cites_id": ["3326192162982213764"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1575714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hDg-OSYCKS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
