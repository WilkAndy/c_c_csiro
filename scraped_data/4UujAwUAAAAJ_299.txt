Mixing process is described by the combined diffusion coefficients method in which the coefficients describe the diffusion of argon \u201cgas\u201d, with respect to steam \u201cgas\u201d. Calculations for currents 150\u2013600 A with 15\u201340 standard liters per minute (slm) of argon reveal inhomogeneous mixing of argon and oxygen-hydrogen species with the argon species prevailing near the arc axis. However, calculations for currents higher than 400 A were not straightforward and a phenomenon of premixing of argon and steam species in the upstream discharge region was predicted from modelling to obtain reasonable agreement with experimental data.
