The whole region of GTA atmosphere including the tungsten cathode, the arc plasma and the anode was treated using a unified numerical model. A viscosity approximation was used to express the diffusion coefficient in terms of viscosity of the shielding gas and metal vapour. The transient two-dimensional distributions of temperature, velocity of plasma flow and iron vapour concentration were predicted, together with the molten pool as a function of time for a 150 A arc current at atmospheric pressure, both for helium and argon gases. It was shown that the thermal plasma in the GTA was influenced by iron vapour from the molten pool surface and that the concentration of iron vapour in the plasma was dependent on the temperature of the molten pool."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14937011819219532966", "cites_id": ["14937011819219532966"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/43/434009/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pjxkIhztSs8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 13, "2012": 16, "2013": 10, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 13, "2017": 10, "2018": 13, "2019": 15, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
