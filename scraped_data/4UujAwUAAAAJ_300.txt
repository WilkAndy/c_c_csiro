In the TIG process, an electric arc is initiated and maintained between a tungsten cathode and a metal anode workpiece, melting the workpiece and forming a weld pool. Metal vapour is generated from the weld pool once the liquid nears its boiling point, affecting the arc welding process. Previous studies have found that metal vapour diffusion is strong in a helium arc, and diffusion driven by the electric field between the electrodes is found to be the main mechanism for metal vapours penetrating upward through the arc (Park et al. 2017). In the present work, we investigate metal vapour diffusion in an argon arc with a stainless-steel workpiece and assess how each diffusion driving force affects the overall transport of metal vapour in the TIG process.An axisymmetric computational model incorporating the arc and the weld pool is applied to treat the transport of iron and chromium vapour in the argon arc plasma, using the combined diffusion coefficient method (Murphy 2014), which takes into account ordinary diffusion, temperature diffusion, pressure diffusion and electric field diffusion at the same time. Our results show that in an argon arc, electric field diffusion is weaker than in a helium arc, and diffusion due to the temperature gradient dominates metal vapour transport. The effect of ordinary diffusion is also significant, especially in the region close to the weld pool. When all the diffusion effects are included, the arc temperature is predicted to be significantly reduced due to the enhanced radiative cooling associated with the presence of the metal vapour.
