In tungsten inert gas welding of high-manganese stainless steels with arc voltage control (AVC), the penetration depth was found to increase with groove wall height. The purpose of this study is to understand the influence of the groove on the penetration depth, mainly through numerical simulation. Spectroscopic measurements were also conducted to validate the simulation. The simulation results showed that when no groove is present, several eddies are formed around the arc column and electrode tip, leading to a recirculating flow pattern. When using a groove, shielding gas introduced from the nozzle flows directly into the arc without forming eddies. In the former case, the metal vapour was transported upwards by the recirculating flow into the arc column and the electrode regions. In contrast, in the latter case, the metal vapour \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4449834220889093755", "cites_id": ["4449834220889093755"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-021-10218-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e7Z4zaX8wD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
