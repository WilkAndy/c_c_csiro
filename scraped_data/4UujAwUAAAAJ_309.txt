A transferred arc device is used to investigate the effect on the arc anode attachment state of the electrode separation and the presence and dimensions of an annular boss, or embossing, on the anode. The experimental results show the diffuse arc anode attachment mode is more likely to be formed in the presence of an annular boss structure on the anode, compared to the standard planar structure. In the case of argon working gas, as the distance between the cathode and the anode increases from 15 mm to 30 mm, the arc maintains the diffuse arc attachment on the anode with the annular boss, while for a planar anode, the arc anode attachment mode changes from diffuse to constricted.
