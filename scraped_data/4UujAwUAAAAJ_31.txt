The occurrence of a central minimum in the radial distributions of temperature and current density is demonstrated. This is in agreement with some recent measurements of arc temperatures in GMAW, but contradicts other measurements and also the predictions of previous models, which do not take metal vapour into account. It is shown that the central minimum is a consequence of the strong radiative emission from the metal vapour. Other effects of the metal vapour, such as the flux of relatively cold vapour from the electrode and the increased electrical conductivity, are found to be less significant. The different effects of metal vapour in gas\u2013tungsten arc welding and GMAW are explained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10495687129069689044", "cites_id": ["10495687129069689044"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/2/022001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1JjW2dUrqJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 12, "2011": 18, "2012": 15, "2013": 13, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 10, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
