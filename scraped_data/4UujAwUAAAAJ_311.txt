The models use the methods of computational fluid dynamics applied to viscous incompressible flows, extended to include an energy conservation equation, Maxwell\u2019s equations, and additional source terms to take into account plasma effects. The models have been used to gain a scientific understanding of arc plasma physics and chemistry and, as they have gained sophistication and accuracy, to improve and optimise industrial processes.The computer codes that have been developed have, until recently, relied on expert users with familiarity with the detailed operation of the code, and access to a FORTRAN compiler. In a typical implementation, input parameters are provided using user-editable text files, progress towards convergence is monitored by viewing a continuously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14861123715468715229", "cites_id": ["14861123715468715229"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14861123715468715229&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3WSlF0hRPc4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
