It is concluded that a predictive model of arc welding requires the arc to be included in the computational domain. This will also facilitate calculation of properties such as microstructure and residual stress."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5555289327224887545", "cites_id": ["5555289327224887545"], "pub_url": "http://ppt.fel.cvut.cz/articles/2015/murphy.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-RjCvTVaGE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2}}
