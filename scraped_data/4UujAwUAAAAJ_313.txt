In the following 34 years, there was only one change of editorship, with Steven Girshick, also of University of Minnesota, replacing Emil Pfender in 2006. Another change is now upon us. Steven Girshick will, as of this issue, step down as editor of Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing. He will remain on the Editorial Board. There have, of course, been many changes in plasma chemistry and plasma processing research since 1980. Back then, there was a strong focus on low-pressure \u2018cold\u2019plasmas, used for example for semiconductor etching, deposition of thin films of a variety of materials including polymers, surface treatment and modification, and atmospheric-pressure thermal plasmas, used in arc welding, plasma spraying and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12580396669878672631", "cites_id": ["12580396669878672631"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-014-9561-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9xygER6Mlq4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2}}
