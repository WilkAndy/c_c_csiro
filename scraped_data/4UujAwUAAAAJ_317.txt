The properties of such an elongated trap are examined using a cold\u2010ion\u2010cloud model. It is shown that increasing the elongation of the trap, while keeping either the smallest dimension or the volume of the trap constant, substantially increases the ratio of the number of ions that can be stored to the magnitude of the second\u2010order Doppler shift of the ions. This indicates that a frequency standard incorporating an elongated rf ion trap can achieve greater precision than one based on the currently favored circular rf or Paul trap."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8408069608629354589", "cites_id": ["8408069608629354589"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.349355", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XUAc3cJ2r3QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1}}
