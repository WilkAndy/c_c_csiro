The objective is to understand the dominant mechanisms in atmospheric plasmas through validated numerical modeling for GTAW welding process. Arcs of all gases have lengths of 10 mm and 200 A current. Five heat transfer mechanisms are considered: Joule heating, convection, radiation, conduction, and Thomson effect. Results indicate that the general structure of the arcs and dominant mechanisms are qualitatively similar for all gases; sizes change depending on the gas. The dominant energy input near the cathode is Joule heating, while that near the anode is convection. The dominant energy output always follows the same sequence: Thomson effect next to the cathode followed by convection \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Xz60mAmATU4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1911160370882420021", "cites_id": ["1911160370882420021"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-023-10328-9", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
