This is primarily because the microstructures in AM parts strongly depend on spatially-varying cooling rates that are caused by several factors including part geometry and proximity to the build plate. Consequently, it is necessary to take a fresh look into methods used for calculating resulting mechanical properties, as the increased spatial resolution that must be applied to the description of properties of AM parts calls for vast improvements in computational efficiency. Computational homogenization methods are employed for the calculation of these mechanical properties based on the polycrystalline microstructures typically encountered in metallic materials.
