Both electrodes (the tungsten cathode and the metal anode workpiece) and the arc plasma are included self-consistently in the computational domain. The influence of adding helium, hydrogen and nitrogen to the argon shielding gas is investigated. It is found that addition of any of the gases increases the heat flow to and the current density at the anode. The shear stress and the arc pressure at the anode surface are increased by adding hydrogen or nitrogen or up to about 50 mol% helium, but decrease when more helium is added. It is predicted that the effect of adding any of the gases is to increase the depth of the weld pool, in agreement with the experimental evidence. The results are explained by referring to the thermodynamic and transport properties of the gas mixtures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1364212438158136021", "cites_id": ["1364212438158136021"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/42/11/115205/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1dKVDvyn7hIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 13, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 17, "2017": 5, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
