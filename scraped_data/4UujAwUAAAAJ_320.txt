The properties of the NPs formed following evaporation of a copper\u2013nickel anode by a helium arc are investigated using a nucleation model coupled to the thermal and flow fields derived from a magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of the arc, and experimentally. Results are obtained for three different Cu: Ni precursor compositions, 10: 90, 50: 50 and 90: 10 at%. The synthesized particles are spherical with different size distributions and have a higher concentration of Cu than the precursor in all three cases, in contrast to previous observations, but in accordance with the predictions of the model. Emission spectroscopic measurements of copper and nickel lines indicate that the concentration of atomic copper in the plasma region near the anode is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17272700042178183104", "cites_id": ["17272700042178183104"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac7a71/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wL_ndSz1tO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
