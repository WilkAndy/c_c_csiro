In this study, a series of comparative experimental studies are conducted with the goal of suppressing nitrogen arc anode ablation by combining argon shielding flow and anode structure. It is found that for the planar electrode structure, the use of argon shielding gas can alleviate the ablation of the anode by nitrogen arc to some extent. If a boron nitride channel is installed on the anode surface to constrain the argon shielding flow, the electrode ablation can be significantly reduced. The experimental results show that there is no significant ablation on the anode surface after 1 h of operation of the nitrogen arc device with an arc current of 100 A. Further analysis reveals that, on the one hand, argon shielding gas can extend the range of motion of the nitrogen arc root along \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4306240579968136865", "cites_id": ["4306240579968136865"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac7bb8/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oXZf9v3WwjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
