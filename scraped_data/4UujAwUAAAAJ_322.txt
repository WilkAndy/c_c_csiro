The model includes the discharge region and the plasma jet flowing to the surrounding steam atmosphere contained in a plasma-chemical chamber. Compared to previous studies, the torch had a smaller nozzle diameter (5.3 mm) and a reduced input power (20\u201340 kW) and arc current (120\u2013220 A). The outlet region for the plasma jet extends to 20 cm downstream of the exit nozzle. Fluid dynamic and thermal characteristics together with diffusion of argon, hydrogen and oxygen species, and distribution of plasma species in the discharge and the plasma jet are obtained for currents from 120 to 220 A. The results of the calculations show that the plasma jet exhibits high spatiotemporal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15854953530160479679", "cites_id": ["15854953530160479679"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac7aee/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v32KhzscCNwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
