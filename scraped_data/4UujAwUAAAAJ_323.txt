The mode of arc attachment is strongly dependent on the gas flow dynamics, gas vortex formation and wall energy exchange. To gain more insight into arc attachment behaviour, this article presents a transient flow plasma model implemented using OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics code to study the effect of gas swirl and arc rotation on modes of arc attachments. A tangentially fed plasma gas creates a gas swirl that helps to induce the arc rotation. The investigations were carried out at arc currents between 200\u2013450 A and input gas flow rates in the range of 5\u201320 slpm. High gas swirl and low arc currents are found to favour constricted attachment on the anode surface.
