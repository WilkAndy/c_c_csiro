It is found that the metal vapours are transported, mainly by convection, from the weld pool to the cathode region. Diffusion driven by temperature gradients is responsible for the metal vapours moving into the recirculating flow. This mechanism differs from that found in TIG welding in helium. Photographic evidence supports the predicted presence of metal vapour near the cathode."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6850413585163848319", "cites_id": ["6850413585163848319"], "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc24/420.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f4ozVNyOEV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
