The paper focuses on numerical simulation of mixing of plasma chemical species under extreme temperature and density gradients in the arc discharge with hybrid stabilization of an electric arc by axial argon flow and tangential water vortex (hybrid-stabilized arc). This arc is being used at present for plasma spraying and for production of syngas (CO + H 2 ) from municipal waste or biomass.We assume one-fluid, two-dimensional, axisymmetric, unsteady, compressible and generally turbulent plasma flow, with mixing of water and argon plasma species considered using the so called combined diffusion coefficients method. Diffusion processes due to pressure, temperature and concentration gradients, and due to an external electric field are taken into account [1, 2]. Energy losses from the argonwater plasma by radiation are calculated by the partial characteristics method [3].
