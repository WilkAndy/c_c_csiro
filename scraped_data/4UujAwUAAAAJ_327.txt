The nitrogen content of weld metal produced by He arc reduces to approximately a half relative to that by Ar arc in the shielding gas condition of less than about 1% mixture ratio. Additionally, it is assumed that a decline in the plasma temperature in the vicinity of the molten pools due to the generation of metal vapour, accompanied by a reduction in atom-like nitrogen content, cause intense impact on the reduction mechanism of weld metal nitrogen content in a He arc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16673734876114584975", "cites_id": ["16673734876114584975"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09507116.2014.921044", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jwXaUYcBZecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
