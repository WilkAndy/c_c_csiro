In addition, combined ordinary, pressure, and thermal diffusion coefficients are given for the mixtures. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for atmospheric pressure plasmas in the temperature range from 300 to 30000 K. The results are compared with those of previously published studies. Significant discrepancies are found; these are attributed to the improved values of the collision integrals used here in calculating the transport coefficients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14208095906432939629", "cites_id": ["14208095906432939629"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/649574/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bfad_fJLLcUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 13, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
