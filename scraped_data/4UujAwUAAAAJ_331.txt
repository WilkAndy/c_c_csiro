The nitrogen content of weld metal produced by He arc reduces to approximately a half relative to that by Ar arc in the shielding gas condition of less than about 1% mixture ratio. Additionally, it is assumed that a decline in the plasma temperature in the vicinity of the molten pools due to the generation of metal vapor, accompanied by a reduction in atom-like nitrogen content, cause intense impact on the reduction mechanism of weld metal nitrogen content in a He arc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11884364916417403443", "cites_id": ["11884364916417403443"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/qjjws/31/1/31_41/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M5os6Oy-7aQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
