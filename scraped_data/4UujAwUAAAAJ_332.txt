In this paper, influence of design of the lamp on radiation produced by the lamp is discussed by employing numerical simulation model developed by modifying numerical simulation model of free burning arc. From evaluation of energy balance in the short arc lamp, it was found that 72.5% of the input power is consumed by the radiation. Furthermore, the shape of the anode and the bulb strongly affect amount of the radiation. Amount of radiation is maximized at diameter of the bottom surface of the anode of 7.5 mm and increases with decreases in diameter of the bulb, because mainly of increase in pressure in the bulb."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1179957985756996588", "cites_id": ["1179957985756996588"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejpes/133/5/133_424/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7GPuTokNYBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
