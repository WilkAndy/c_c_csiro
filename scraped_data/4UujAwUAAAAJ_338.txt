It was found that by pulsing the microwave energy with a 50% duty cycle, the average power required to sustain a microwave-induced plasma discharge was decreased by about 40%. The ratio of absorbed to incident power was unaffected. These findings were confirmed for pulse frequencies from 10 to 300 Hz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3888644363838468200", "cites_id": ["3888644363838468200"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08327823.2003.11688491", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aLBqLHI99zUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
