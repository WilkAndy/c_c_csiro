In particular, purified gases and extensive vacuum processing are necessary for creating a highly controlled environment, isolated from ambient air, to enable the growth of graphene films. Here we exploit the ambient-air environment to enable the growth of graphene films, without the need for compressed gases. A renewable natural precursor, soybean oil, is transformed into continuous graphene films, composed of single-to-few layers, in a single step. The enabling parameters for controlled synthesis and tailored properties of the graphene film are discussed, and a mechanism for the ambient-air growth is proposed. Furthermore, the functionality of the graphene is demonstrated through direct utilization as an electrode to realize an effective \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14210571823516736340", "cites_id": ["14210571823516736340"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14217", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VNvjW8gXNsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 28, "2019": 22, "2020": 20, "2021": 25, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
