In the case of low temperatures, the problem is solved analytically for free-burning and wall-stabilized electric arcs. For a wider temperature range, the problem is solved by numerical simulation. The temperature profile for the free-burning electric arc was obtained using a Gaussian approximation of experimental results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=574007751179506945,14653924262617512973", "cites_id": ["574007751179506945", "14653924262617512973"], "pub_url": "http://dspace.nbuv.gov.ua/handle/123456789/79276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ARVgKwJJ9wcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
