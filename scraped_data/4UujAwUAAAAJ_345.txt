This will be the first high power, long pulse experiment in a large stellarator. Minority (H in D) and second harmonic heating of hydrogen will be possible. The technical system is described in detail.(author). 11 refs.; 4 figs"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15404531487999926783", "cites_id": ["15404531487999926783"], "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:21065762", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_yGOicXjx9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1}}
