This scheme has been investigated in low power experiments in the TORTUS tokamak. An array of magnetic probes positioned along a vertical diameter of the plasma has been used to measure the wave fields excited by Faraday shielded eighty degree sector antennas with current elements oriented perpendicular to the toroidal field. Pronounced enhancement of the wave fields at radii consistent with the calculated radii of ARSs has been observed. The wave fields excited by a number of distinct phasings of an array of three toroidally spaced antennas have been compared. The results provide unambiguous evidence that the wave field enhancement is due to mode \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3080758915742464694", "cites_id": ["3080758915742464694"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.36648", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tnpyS-kNwSoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1}}
