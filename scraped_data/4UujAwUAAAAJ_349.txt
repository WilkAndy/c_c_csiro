In this study, we have developed a three-dimensional arc plasma-droplet-molten pool integrated model of GMAW-based WAAM of Al alloy, which simultaneously includes the heating of arc plasma, the vaporization of Al metal, the transfer of droplet, the melting and solidification of molten pool, and the relative motion between wire and substrate. Based on this sophisticated model, the effect of Al vapor on the arc plasma characteristics, the dynamic evolution of arc plasma characteristics during the metal transfer process, and the heat transfer and flow behaviors of liquid metal are comprehensively investigated. The simulation results show that the Al vapor is principally generated from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612523005200", "cites_per_year": {}}
