The significant effects of wire retraction on the arc plasma characteristics and the thermal properties of the metal are not well understood. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional, transient, multi-physics coupled GMAW model with wire retraction and apply it to wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) of an aluminum alloy. The model takes into account the wire's downward and upward motion, droplet growth and detachment, arc plasma heating, metal vaporization, melting and solidification of the molten pool, and the relative motion of the wire and substrate. The model is used to simulate the deposition of a single layer, and the evolution of the arc characteristics and the metal thermal and flow behavior are analyzed.
