Using electricity-driven non-thermal plasma catalysis to fix nitrogen into NO3\u2212 is a promising solution, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study integrates a structured catalyst into a plasma column with a water-electrode bubble reactor that can fix nitrogen at ambient pressure and temperature with a 93% selectivity to NO3\u2212 with excellent catalytic stability. Characterizations of the catalyst and in situ plasma diagnostics indicate that the enhanced production of nitrate ions is due to abundant chemisorbed oxidized nitrogens species originating from NO and NO2 produced by the air plasma. The plasma chemistry model combined with DFT simulations demonstrates the role of structured TiO2 supported by 5% graphene oxide (GO) to improve NOx surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138589472302572X", "cites_per_year": {}}
