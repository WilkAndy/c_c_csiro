Because the arc involves temperatures of 20 000 K, and gas velocities of the order of 300 m/s, there are only a few experiments and models available to determine optimal, or at least acceptable, parameters for the operation such as current, voltage, and arc length. On the other hand, there is a lack of engineering guidance to optimize the processes resulting in costly and time-consuming trial-and-error optimization methods, which also involve wasteful use of energy and scrap parts. In this work, a numerical model of the gas-tungsten arc welding (GTAW) arc was created and validated against experiments. The model considers the arc interactions between a non-consumable electrode and the weld pool and accounts for multiple coupled heat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1281/1/012007/meta", "cites_per_year": {}}
