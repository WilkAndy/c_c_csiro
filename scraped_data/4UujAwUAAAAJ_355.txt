A comparison of metal transfer in pure argon gas was carried out using a solid wire (wire 1), a metal-cored wire without an alkaline element (wire 2), and another metal-cored wire with 0.084 mass% of sodium (wire 3). The experiments were conducted under 280 and 320 A welding currents, observed by high-speed imaging techniques equipped with laser assistance and bandpass filters. At 280 A, wire 1 showed a streaming transfer mode, while the others showed a projected one. When the current was 320 A, the metal transfer of wire 2 changed to streaming, while wire 3 remained projected. As sodium has a lower ionization energy than iron, the mixing of sodium vapor into the iron plasma increases its electrical conductivity, raising the proportion of current flowing through metal vapor plasma. As a result, the current flows to the upper region of the molten metal on the wire tip, with the resulting electromagnetic force causing droplet detachment. Consequently, the metal transfer mode in wire 3 remained projected. Furthermore, weld bead formation is the best for wire 3."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/8/3053", "cites_per_year": {}}
