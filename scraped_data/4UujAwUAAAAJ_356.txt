However, a complete and consistent set of electron-neutral collision cross-sections of C 4 F 7 N is still lacking, which hinders relevant plasma modeling. In this contribution, the available electron-neutral collision cross-sections of C 4 F 7 N are first compiled and assessed. The initial cross-sections are adjusted iteratively by the electron swarm method to determine a complete and self-consistent cross-section set of C 4 F 7 N for the first time. The set is validated by a systematic comparison of electron swarm parameters between Boltzmann equation analysis and experimental measurements in pure C 4 F 7 N as well as C 4 F 7 N/N 2 and C 4 F 7 N/Ar mixtures. The proposed cross-section set of C 4 F 7 N will be made available to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/acbd5d/meta", "cites_per_year": {}}
