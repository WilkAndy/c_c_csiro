They are also an indispensable tool for the fundamental understanding of the basic phenomena involved and the optimization of the process operating conditions. Compared to calculations for ordinary gases, plasmas impose additional difficulties due to the large numbers of chemical species at elevated temperatures (including charged particles) and the chemical reactions taking place in plasmas. As shown in Part I, Chapter 6, Thermodynamic Properties of Plasmas, and Chapter 7, Transport Properties of Gases Under Plasma Conditions, the calculation of plasma properties can be a formidable task, especially as far as transport and radiation properties are conceded. Collision cross sections required for those calculations suffer from relatively large uncertainties associated with the assumptions which have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-84936-8_43.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
