Nonthermal plasma provides a highly promising method for bio-oil upgrading under ambient conditions without catalysts. However, the diversity of products formed in plasma processing makes it necessary to understand the interaction mechanisms and reaction pathways. Here, we present a new approach for selectively clipping a lignin-derived monomer (guaiacol) by nonthermal plasma and propose a product selection mechanism governing the relationship between the product distribution and mean electron energy. Density functional theory calculations and a one-dimensional plasma fluid model show that the gas temperature determines whether the reaction is directed toward aromatic ring hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation.
