The model considers both electron and vibrational kinetics, including excited N 2 (X, \u03bd) and H 2 (X, \u03bd) species, and surface reactions such as those occurring by the Eley\u2013Rideal and Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood mechanisms and dissociative adsorption of molecules. The predictions of the model are compared to the measured NH 3 concentration produced in a packed-bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor as a function of process parameters such as input gas composition and applied voltage. Unlike typical low-pressure plasma processes, under the plasma conditions considered here (reduced electric field E/N in the range 30\u201350 Td, electron density of the order 10 8 cm\u2212 3), the influence of ions is not significant. Instead, the reactions between radicals and vibrationally-excited \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7002880243070196570", "cites_id": ["7002880243070196570"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aa6229/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WtvMbHo6L2EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 10, "2019": 17, "2020": 22, "2021": 26, "2022": 25, "2023": 22}}
