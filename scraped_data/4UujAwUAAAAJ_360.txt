The computational model considered the effects of a shielding gas flow on a slag floating on a weld pool surface. The computational result showed that the slags were generated on the weld pool surface near the centre of a heat source and were transferred to the edge of the pool. Those tendencies were similar to those observed in an experiment. The slags stayed at the trailing region of the pool and then deposited on a weld bead. These behaviours supported the validity of the present computational result. To identify the dominant factors of the slag behaviour on the weld pool, numerical experiments were conducted with individually acting forces due to the Marangoni effect, the shearing force, the Lorentz \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09507116.2022.2059147", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wvg0ZDbAljAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
