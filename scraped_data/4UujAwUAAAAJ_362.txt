Electricity-driven plasma catalysis is receiving increasing attention as a sustainable technology for the efficient synthesis of ammonia. However, the current implementation of nonthermal plasma technology still faces several hurdles, particularly the extensive usage of energy-intensive H\u2082, low energy efficiency and the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the plasma catalysis process. Here we propose a green chemical pathway of plasma catalysis from nitrogen and water for sustainable ammonia production. In order to understand the different characteristics of the N\u2082/H\u2082O plasma system and seek further improvements in ammonia synthesis, detailed plasma kinetics modelling is presented in comparison with the N\u2082/H\u2082 system at atmospheric pressure. The model includes both electron and vibrational kinetics and updated surface reactions adapted from DFT calculation results on the SiO\u2082 surface. The facile dissociative adsorption of H\u2082O and the Eley\u2013Rideal mechanisms are demonstrated to be important to enable efficient NH\u2083 production as the experimental observation. The model reproduced the measured trends of ammonia production on the different concentrations of H\u2082O input and power density with reasonable accuracy and provided an explanation of the critical influence of temperature and catalyst packing in the N\u2082/H\u2082O system in comparison to the N\u2082/H\u2082 system in relation to the quenching effect of H\u2082O by vibrational\u2013translational \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7952713", "cites_per_year": {}}
