The most important aspects of the underlying physics have already been understood, so no fundamentally new physical mechanisms have been described in the recent publications (which are many); the aim was rather to develop practicable numerical models that adequately describe known mechanisms. Unfortunately, no universally accepted numerical models have emerged: the developed models are in many cases incompatible with each other and it is not easy to identify the place of each model in the global \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0022-3727/page/special-issue-on-thermal-plasma-material-interactions", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7YgoK-wQQ98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
