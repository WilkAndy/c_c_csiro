In this process, an arc plasma is strongly constricted due to a flow control using an additional nozzle which is called\" constricted nozzle\". This welding process overcomes disadvantages of a conventional GTA welding such as low welding speed and low welding efficiency. As a result, it achieves a welding of butt joint of quite thin-sheet metals which is difficult for the conventional GTA welding. However the mechanism of this improvement is difficult to be understood by experimental approaches and is still unclear because the arc phenomena are quite complicated. In this study, we developed the computational model which uses a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry in order to analyse the arc phenomena during the GTA welding with a constricted nozzle.
