This paper reports current density and heat flux distributions at the anode surface and temperature distributions of the arc plasma for pure argon arc. The results show that the current density and heat flux near the centre of the arc really increased due to a cooling effect of a high speed gas flow inside a constricted nozzle and the arc constriction was confirmed by measurements of temperature distribution"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:uDGL6kOW6j0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:48066226", "cites_per_year": {}}
