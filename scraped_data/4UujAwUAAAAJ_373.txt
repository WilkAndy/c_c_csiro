Results of simulation for 300-500 A indicate inhomogeneous mixing of argon and oxygen-hydrogen species for all currents. The argon diffusion mass flux is driven mainly by the concentration and temperature space gradients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiri-Jenista/publication/286622326_Preliminary_Study_of_Mixing_of_Plasma_Species_in_a_Hybrid-Stabilized_Argon-Water_Electric_Arc/links/566c2fb808aea0892c4faa76/Preliminary-Study-of-Mixing-of-Plasma-Species-in-a-Hybrid-Stabilized-Argon-Water-Electric-Arc.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BM8ORc5JzMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
