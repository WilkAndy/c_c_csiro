Moreover they are available in a wide range of configurations (direct-current transferred arcs, direct-current non-transferred arcs or plasma torches, alternating-current arcs, radio-frequency inductively-coupled plasmas, microwave plasmas and laser-produced plasmas) and powers (from hundreds of watts to a hundred megawatts). It is therefore not surprising that they find application in many industrial processes, including those for joining, melting, cutting, coating and deposition, refining, waste treatment, chemical analysis, lighting, propulsion and circuit interruption. It is these many applications that underlie all thermal plasma research; even when arcane questions such as the extent of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-015-9621-1", "cites_per_year": {}}
