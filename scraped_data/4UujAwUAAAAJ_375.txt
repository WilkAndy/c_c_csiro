A two-dimensional model has been used to determine electric field strengths and charge densities around solids of various geometries and electrical conductivities. The calculations take into account the distortion of the background electric fields by the solid material and the production and motion of charged species. Detailed time-dependent visualizations of the streamer initiation and propagation are presented. The effects of size and aspect ratio of the gross features of the aircraft on the development of the streamers is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/550/1/012002/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cDz3OiFa9SYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
