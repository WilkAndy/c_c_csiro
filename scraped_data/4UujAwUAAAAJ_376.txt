The reduced ionization coefficient \u03b1/N and reduced attachment coefficient \u03b7/N are calculated, allowing the reduced effective ionization coefficient (\u03b1\u2013\u03b7)/N and the critical reduced electric field strength (E/N){sub cr} (the reduced electric field for which (\u03b1\u2013\u03b7)/N = 0), to be determined. A high value of (E/N){sub cr} for an electronegative gas, such as those considered here, indicates good insulating properties. It is found that c-C{sub 4}F{sub 8}\u2013N{sub 2} and c-C{sub 4}F{sub 8}\u2013air have very similar (E/N){sub cr} values, higher than those of the other three mixtures, and superior even to that of pure SF{sub 6} for c-C{sub 4}F{sub 8} concentrations above 80%. Comparison of the results obtained for c-C{sub 4}F{sub 8} and c-C{sub 4}F{sub 8}\u2013N{sub 2} with experimental values from the literature supports the validity of the approach taken here and the parameters used.
