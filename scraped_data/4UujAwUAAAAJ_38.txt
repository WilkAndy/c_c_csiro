A three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of air arc plasma, taking into account the production of metal vapour from erosion of an iron splitter plate, is developed. An equation describing conservation of the iron vapour mass is added to the standard mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. The influence of the iron vapour on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the gas mixture is considered. The arc voltage, distributions of temperature, gas flow and mass fraction of iron vapour in the arc chamber are calculated. The formation of new arc roots on the splitter plate is examined. The simulation results indicate that this is strongly influenced by the presence of iron vapour from the splitter plate, due to the increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4275267423234119632", "cites_id": ["4275267423234119632"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/43/434011/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0Fer8RHNVDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 13, "2019": 22, "2020": 9, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
