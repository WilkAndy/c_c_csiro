For example, the plasma temperature of the He arc near the molten pool decreases to 6500K, while that of the Ar arc without metal vapor keeps high temperature of about 12000K [1]. The mixture of metal vapor in arc plasma causes a decrease in its electrical conductivity, and it is understood that the plasma temperature diminishes because of the lower Joule heating.Meanwhile, a higher temperature molten pool is required to produce the metal vapor. However, in the view of a thermal balance between plasma and anode surface, the phenomenon of decreasing plasma temperature is considered to contradict with the phenomenon of increasing molten pool temperature. In other word, there is a question why higher temperature molten pool can be produced by the lower temperature plasma. In this paper, numerical analyses of gas tungsten arc welding taking into consideration of the metal vapor were carried out in order to clarify the anode heat transfer mechanism."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP1210282&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DEQ_nvAkwO0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
