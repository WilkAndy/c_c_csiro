Metal-inert-gas (MIG) welding is the most-widely used form of arc welding in manufacturing. An arc is struck, usually in argon, between a metal wire electrode and the workpiece. The wire electrode melts, forming droplets that pass through the arc into the weld pool (the molten region of the workpiece)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6384053/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OItRv-nP-qgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
