It is found that the additions of helium, hydrogen and nitrogen to argon all increase the arc and anode temperature. For helium, this is due to the lower electrical conductivity; in the other cases, it is due to the higher specific heat."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3825665283651363062", "cites_id": ["3825665283651363062"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174329308X283929", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9mCVZU5-FzUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 21, "2021": 14, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
