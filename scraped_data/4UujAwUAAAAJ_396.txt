However, the formation mechanisms are poorly understood. A three\u2013dimensional fluid mode of a dc arc discharge in helium that includes the carbon electrodes and their vaporization self\u2013consistently has been developed; preliminary results are presented in this paper. This model allows the determination of the concentration of carbon species at all points in the arc. Results obtained by including and neglecting electrode vaporization are compared."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc20/150.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5wOdBaigmgcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
