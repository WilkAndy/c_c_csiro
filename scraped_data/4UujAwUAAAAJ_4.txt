The plasma parameters can span many orders of magnitude and applications are found in quite different areas of daily life and industrial production. As a consequence, the trends in research, science and technology are difficult to follow and it is not easy to identify the major challenges of the field and their many sub-fields. Even for experts the road to the future is sometimes lost in the mist. Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics is addressing this need for clarity and thus providing guidance to the field by this special Review article, The 2012 Plasma Roadmap."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 731, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1474819358477365150", "cites_id": ["1474819358477365150"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/45/25/253001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nq_pgWScdxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 47, "2014": 64, "2015": 60, "2016": 84, "2017": 98, "2018": 82, "2019": 66, "2020": 67, "2021": 68, "2022": 65, "2023": 18}}
