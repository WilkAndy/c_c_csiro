In particular, the low-voltage dc circuit breaker has been arousing great research interest in recent years. In this type of circuit breaker, an air arc is formed in the interrupting process which is a 3D transient arc in a complex chamber geometry with splitter plates. Controlling the arc evolution and the extinction are the most significant problems. This paper reviews published research works referring to LVCB arcs. Based on the working principle, the arcing process is divided into arc commutation, arc motion and arc splitting; we focus our attention on the modelling and measurement of these phases. In addition, previous approaches in papers of the critical physical phenomenon treatment are discussed, such as radiation, metal erosion, wall ablation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14496156959736361742", "cites_id": ["14496156959736361742"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/46/27/273001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DnNkcfOxLMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 15, "2018": 15, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
