The computational domain includes the electrode, arc plasma and weld pool, and the model solves equations based on those of fluid dynamics in three dimensions. results that take into account the arc plasma, the motion of the electrode, deformation of the weld pool surface and metal droplet transfer are presented and discussed. The importance of including the arc plasma in the computational domain is demonstrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP101806&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m3npAtP_2q8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
