Measured reflectances are compared with those calculated using a two-flux model of radiative transfer, modified to take into account the optically-rough surface. The required scattering and absorption coefficients of the nanoparticles are calculated using a standard Mie scattering method for optically-isolated particles, and the generalized-multiparticle-Mie method for clusters of particles. The calculated reflectances show good agreement with measurements for the films containing optically-isolated particles. Progress is described for the films containing clusters of particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6045259/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:69G_LYEWYoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
