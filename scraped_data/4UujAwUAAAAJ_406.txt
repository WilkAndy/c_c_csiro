It is demonstrated through three examples (the effect of shielding gas composition, metal vapour and electrode shape on the weld pool) that reliable prediction of weld pool depth and geometry requires that the arc plasma is included in the computational domain."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/papers/212.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6_P_6EnpX7MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
