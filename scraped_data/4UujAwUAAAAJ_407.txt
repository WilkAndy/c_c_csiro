The axisymmetric model implements MHD as well as turbulent mixing and thermal demixing of metal vapour in argon. The results are in good agreement with experimentally-observed temperatures and demonstrate a local central minimum in the radial temperature and radial electric current density distributions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/papers/242.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lSx8BRdvMqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
