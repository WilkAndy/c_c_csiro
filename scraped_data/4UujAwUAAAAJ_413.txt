A double gas shielded system which consists of CO2 gas and inert gas is employed for the plasma arc torch, so avoiding the consumption of tungsten electrode, and then achieves equivalent arc stability to a TIG arc for 1800 seconds operation. The arc voltage of the CO2 gas shielded plasma arc in the conditions of arc current 150 A and arc gap 3 mm is about 19 V, which is much higher than the 12 V of a TIG arc. The CO2 gas clearly constricts the arc and the maximum heat intensity at the anode surface in the CO2 gas shielded plasma arc becomes about 10 times larger than that of the TIG arc. The penetration depth of stainless steel melted by the CO2 gas shielded plasma arc is much larger than that for the argon TIG \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/repo/ouka/all/6515/jwri35_01_09.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cPkVaX8ZtvcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
