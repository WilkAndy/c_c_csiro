One of the reasons is that the ability to control the generation, transport, deposition, and structural incorporation of the building units of such films and structures, still remains elusive. On the other hand, the concept of deterministic plasma nanoscience is treated with extreme caution due to inherent chaotic nature of the plasma at the microscopic level. This contribution is an overview of recent work within the International Research Network for Deterministic Plasma-Aided Nanofabrication (1RNDPAN) and details how to challenge one of the previously intractable problems of bridging nine orders of magnitude between the sizes of plasma nanofabrication facilities (0.5 m) and self-organization of adsorbed building units on solid surfaces (0.2 run). One of the possibilities is to manipulate the building blocks in the non-neutral layer of space charge that separates the plasma and solid surfaces and control self-organization of nanostructure building blocks on plasmaexposed surfaces and their insertion into the nanoassemblies. The results of advanced computer simulation allow one to obtain the microscopic topology of ion fluxes in the vicinity of selected functional nanostructures and the arrangement of adsorbed species into nanopatterns on solid surfaces. These results are linked, via the sheath parameters, to the building unit densities and energies in the plasma bulk and eventually to the process control parameters. On the other hand, the desired nanoassemblies can be engineered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20843142", "cites_per_year": {}}
