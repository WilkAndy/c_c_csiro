In most of these applications, the plasma is composed of a mixture of gases, often including impurities. The modelling of such plasmas is considered in this paper. Evidence that thermal plasmas can be treated using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) approximation is presented. The calculation of thermophysical properties of the plasmas in LTE is considered, in particular the challenges presented by the presence of gas mixtures. The importance of the correct treatment of the mixing and demixing of different gases is emphasised through three examples: demixing in welding arcs, turbulent mixing of plasma jets with ambient air, and the vaporisation of metal electrodes by a welding arc.(author)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:36004870", "cites_per_year": {}}
