Both diagnostics and modelling are discussed. The focus is on the arc plasma, and its interactions with the electrode and workpiece, in tungsten\u2013inert-gas and metal\u2013inert-gas welding. Areas in which the need for further work is identified include development of techniques to measure current density distributions, calculation of the distribution of different gasses in the arc plasma (for example vapours of different metallic elements when welding alloys), computational methods for modelling metal transfer, and treatments of the sheath regions. It is shown that a thorough understanding of the arc is important in welding research and development. For example, reliable calculation of the heat flux to the workpiece requires the interactions between the arc and electrodes to be considered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14497697971214462242", "cites_id": ["14497697971214462242"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11090-015-9620-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Iq0jI34rMskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 18, "2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 18, "2022": 10, "2023": 11}}
