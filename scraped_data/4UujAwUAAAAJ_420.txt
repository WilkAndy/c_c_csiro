The availability of the required basic data, ie, thermodynamic properties of individual species and collision integrals for pairs of species, is surveyed. The calculation of diffusion coefficients, required in mixed-gas plasmas, is discussed, and the advantages of the combined diffusion coefficient formulation are outlined. The specific application of demixing is presented. Recent work addressing the difficulties that arise in calculating the composition and transport coefficients of two-temperature plasmas is briefly reviewed.(author)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:34004589", "cites_per_year": {}}
