In particular, the use of oxygen and steam as oxidising gases is compared. Measurements of the exhaust gas composition are compared with the results Of calculations performed using a comprehensive chemical kinetic scheme. It is found that significant interconversion of ozone-depleting substances occurs, particularly for chloro-fluorocarbon destruction Steam is found to be a superior oxidising gas to oxygen, with greatly reduced levels of ozone-depleting substances and CF{sub 4} in the exhaust gas, particularly if the steam is input at close to or greater than stoichiometric levels.
