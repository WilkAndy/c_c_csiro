Applications include arc welding, circuit breakers and switch gear used to interrupt large electrical currents, arc furnaces used to process minerals, arc lamps for lighting, and arc torches, or plasma torches, used for plasma cutting, plasma spraying and waste destruction. A feature of most of these applications is that mixtures of different gases are used. For example, in tungsten-inert-gas (TIG) welding, helium or hydrogen is often added to the argon plasma gas. In metal-inert-gas (MIG) welding, carbon dioxide or oxygen is added to argon. In circuit breakers, sulfur hexafluoride is usually used, and ablated polymer or ceramic vapours form part of the mixture. In plasma spraying, nitrogen, helium or hydrogen is typically added to argon. In many applications, metal evaporated from electrodes can'contaminate'the gas mixture. In mineral processing and waste destruction, very complex gas mixtures are present. Despite the ubiquity of gas mixtures in thermal plasma applications, scientific investigations, both experimental and theoretical, have tended to concentrate on plasmas in pure, homonuclear gases; ie, plasmas containing only a single chemical element. This has been mainly for reasons of simplicity: the presence of more than one chemical element complicates both the measurement and calculation of the properties of thermal plasmas. The major difficulty in the theoretical study of mixed-gas thermal plasmas is the treatment of diffusion in the presence of many species. In this article, I will outline the problem, and present an elegant solution with wide applicability. I will then examine the phenomenon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:33024782", "cites_per_year": {}}
