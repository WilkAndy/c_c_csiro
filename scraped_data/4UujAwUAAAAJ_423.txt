The PLASCON^ TM system, developed by CSIRO and Siddons Ramset Plasma Ltd, has been applied to the destruction of a range of hazardous liquids and gases. The liquid or gas is injected, together with an oxidising gas, downstream of the anode of a dc atmospheric-pressure plasma torch. The resulting mixture of hot gases passes through a reaction tube, and is then rapidly quenched. The cooled gases pass through a scrubber to remove acid gases and halogens. Four 150 kW PLASCON systems are now operating on a commercial basis in Australia, destroying the liquid waste stream from the production of the herbicide 2, 4D, Australia's stockpile of ozone-depleting chemicals, and PCB contaminated oils. The successful development of the PLASCON process required \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000APS..DPPVI2002M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
