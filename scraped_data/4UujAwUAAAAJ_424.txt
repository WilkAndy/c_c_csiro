In arc welding, for example, mixtures of argon with helium, hydrogen, carbon dioxide or oxygen are used. Demixing is a diffusion-driven phenomenon that leads to the partial separation of the different chemical elements present in such arcs. Typically the chemical elements with lower mass and higher ionization energies are concentrated in the high-temperature regions of the arc. A two-dimensional numerical model of demixing in atmospheric-pressure free burning arcs has been developed.(AB Murphy, Phys. Rev. E, 55)(1997) 7473--94; J. Phys. D, 31 (1998) 3383--90. The model incorporates the combined-diffusion-coefficient treatment of diffusion,(AB Murphy, Phys. Rev. E, 48)(1993) 3594--604. which allows all species derived from a particular chemical element to be grouped together.
