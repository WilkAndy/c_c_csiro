Radial profiles are presented for three axial locations. A comparison between the measured profiles and profiles calculated using a diffusion model that considers demixing processes is made, indicating that local chemical equilibrium is not maintained at larger radii in the arc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223689", "cites_per_year": {}}
