Five different poloidal positions of the X-point are studied (inside and outside the torus, on the top of the section and two intermediate positions), and compared to an equivalent reference circular case. For low P plasmas, we compute the current limit imposed by the n= l kink. The stable operating window, in the (qo. qcyl) plane*> s also determined. The lower bound on qcy| is found to be-1.2 for the divertor configuration. Then the p-limit at different values of the total current is considered. The maximum value of (J set by the n= l mode is comparable for each configuration, except when the X point points upwards, in which case (he maximum is roughly doubled. The results of the ballooning optimization are also presented for the five divertor configurations and for the reference circular case. 1 Introdurtion.Experimental results and p optimization studies show that ideal MHD stability imposes a limit on the value of p in tokamaks. Theoretically it was found (1] that the critical p* is proportional to the normalized current: pc= g IN, with lN= M0I (A)/a (m) B (T) and a=(rm \u201e-rmin)/2, where rm \u201eand rmin are the maximum and the minimum distance of the plasma surface to the torus axis. Only limiter configurations have been considered. The object of this work is to extend these results to divertor configurations which offer the possibility of reaching a high confinement regime [2]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:21060428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FTwYH_7rkJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
