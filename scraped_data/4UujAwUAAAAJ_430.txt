A conventional vacuum waveguide cannot, however, be used to launch the fast wave in a toroidal device, owing to the relatively low frequencies used, and the need to position the launcher between toroidal field coils. In this paper I evaluate an alternative waveguide design which has been proposed by Vdovin for the ITER device. The waveguide is dimensioned with a>c/(2f)>>b, where f is the excitation frequency and c the speed of light, so that only the TE{sub 1,0} mode propagates. This mode is excited by a horizontal coupling probe. A wire grid oriented at an angle {psi} to the vertical wall rotates the wave polarization from {pi}/2 to {pi}/2-{psi}, through excitation of a large evanescent TE{sub 0,1} component. A horizontal Faraday screen at the waveguide mouth acts as an analyzer, reflecting the remaining TE{sub 1,0} component, and allowing the TE{sub 0,0} component to be coupled to the plasma. I first analyze separately the coupling from the waveguide to a large plasma through the Faraday screen, and the reflection and transmission of waveguide modes by the grid. I then consider the combined effect of these discontinuities, and coupling from a transmission line to the waveguide through the coupling probe.
