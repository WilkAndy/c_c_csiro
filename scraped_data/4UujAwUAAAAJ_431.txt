A conventional vacuum waveguide cannot, however, be used to launch the fast wave in a toroidal device, owing to the relatively low frequencies used, and the need to position the launcher between toroidal field coils. In this paper I evaluate an alternative waveguide design, illustrated in Fig. 1, which has been proposed by Vdovin [li see also 2J for the ITER device. The waveguide is dimensioned with a> c/(2f):> b, where f is the excitation frequency and c the speed of light, so that only the TE1, o mode propagates. This mode is excited by a horizontal coupling probe. A wire grid oriented at an angle tb to the vertical wall rotates the wave polarization from 1f/2 to 1f/2-tb, through excitation of a large evanescent TEo, l component. A horizontal Faraday screen at the waveguide mouth acts as an analyzer, reflecting the remaining TE1, o component, and allowing the TEo, l component to be coupled to the plasma. I first analyze separately the coupling from the waveguide to a large plasma through the Faraday screen, and the reflection and transmission of waveguide modes by the grid. I then consider the combined effect of these. discontinuities, and coupling from a transmission line to the waveguide through the coupling probe."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2226423/component/file_3374561/content", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xymO26OOkoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
