This scheme relics on mode conversion of the compressional Alfven wave, generated by an external antenna, to the torsional Alfvcn wave, at a resonance surface inside the plasma. The only compressional wave modes that propagate at sufficiently low frequencies are those poloidally asymmetric (m= I 0) modes known as surface waves. Surface waves are also relevant to the ion cyclotron heating scheme, as they may be parasitically excited by antennas designed to couple to those'cut-off'modes of the compressional wave which do not propagate above a certain non-zero frequency [1, 2].The behaviour of Alfven surface waves has been investigated theoretically in both single-ion [3-8] and two-ion species [9'-11] plasmas. All these studies assumed the plasma to be separated from a conduding wall by an insulating or vacuum gap. Cross and Murphy [12J showed that the surface wave spectrum in a single-ion species plasma is significantly affected when this gap is replaced by a region of low density plasma. The present paper extends this work to the case of a two-ion species plasma. The results are relevant to Alfven wave heating of a plasma containing impurity species and to ion cyclotron minority and mode conversion heating."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2228487/component/file_3343083/content", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5J_0nsEObVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
