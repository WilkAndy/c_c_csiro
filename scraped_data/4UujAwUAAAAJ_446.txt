If combined with a renewable energy source, plasma-catalytic ammonia production could also be a key player in boosting the hydrogen economy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Ammonia is an important chemical, most commonly known for its use as a fertilizer; it is also an excellent hydrogen storage molecule due to the 1: 3 (N: H) ratio of NH3 and can be transported using existing natural gas infrastructure. Plasma processes are highly versatile and scalable, making them useful in isolated regions as well as on an industrial scale. They can easily be scaled by altering the discharge volume or, if larger scale operation is required, modular systems of multiple reactors can be employed. The quick start-up and shut-down time of this electrical process make this technology useful for combining with renewable energy, where fluctuations readily occur. However, current plasma systems have low NH3 yields and energy efficiencies. Although an increase in these properties is achievable by combining a catalyst with the plasma, energy efficiencies remain an order of magnitude too low for the process to be viable. Furthermore, interactions between the plasma and catalyst, that determine which species are present and the reaction pathways, are largely unknown. Generally, catalysts are selected based on their activity in the thermal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://aappsdpp.org/DPP2021/A/5192.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cVCIDWraTpcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
