As in thermal catalysis, chemical reactions occur on the catalyst surface. In thermal catalysis, however, only ground-state molecules are present in the gas phase. In a plasma, vibrationally and electronically excited molecules, radicals, atoms, ions and electrons are all present, leading to a much more extensive range of chemical reactions. The physical interactions between the plasma and catalyst, such as charge transfer, electric field modification and heat transfer, affect the plasma and the catalyst, and therefore the chemical reactions. In considering the interactions between the plasma and the catalyst, we must also take into account the support structure of the catalyst, such as the dielectric beads used in a packed-bed reactor.The plasma itself is well understood. For example, the properties of filamentary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab9048/ampdf#page=37", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x6C8vox_yHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
