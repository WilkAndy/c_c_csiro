This paper aims to analytically investigate and compare the dielectric breakdown properties of SF6\u2013N2 and SF6\u2013CF4 mixtures for different concentrations of SF6 at 0.4 MPa and gas temperatures up to 3000 K. First, the equilibrium compositions of those gas mixtures are calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy under the assumptions of local thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium. Then the (E/N) cr of those hot gases, defined as the value for which the balance is reached between the total ionization rate coefficient and the total attachment rate coefficient, are determined by Boltzmann equation analysis. It is found that for T> 2000 K, both these mixtures have superior dielectric breakdown properties to pure SF6, and (E/N) cr increases with decreasing concentration of SF6. Unlike the cases of pure SF6 and SF6\u2013N2 mixtures,(E/N) cr in SF6\u2013CF4 mixtures increases with temperature for T> 2500 K, as a result of the products of dissociation of CF4, in particular CF2. In addition, for the full gas temperature range considered,(E/N) cr in 50% SF6-50% N2 is clearly higher than that in 50% SF6-50% CF4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2524968101013855569&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UZ0fKhx9CiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
