A three-dimensional computational model of the arc, which includes the vaporization of the wire electrode, is used to provide the input parameters to the zero-dimensional model. In the presence of oxygen, FeO nanoparticles are produced, which are smaller and more numerous than the Fe nanoparticles formed in the absence of oxygen."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc23/287.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yFRvvhBb4zsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
