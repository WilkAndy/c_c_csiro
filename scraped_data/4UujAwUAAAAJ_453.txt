It focuses on mixing of iron vapour and shielding gas of a mixture of two gases, and two separate equations of conservation of mass fraction for species are required. Results obtained by including and neglecting iron vapour or different shielding gas mixtures are compared. The model could be used for applications of thermal plasmas including three gas mixtures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc23/158.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f_s59oJSnWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
