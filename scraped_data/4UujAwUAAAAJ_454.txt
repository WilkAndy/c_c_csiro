The results contrast with the conventional understanding: the surface-adsorbed atomic hydrogen H (s) and the NH radical take a leading role in the formation of NH3, and the dissociative adsorption of molecules and three-body reactions are important. This is significantly different from the mechanisms in conventional thermochemical processes and low-pressure plasmas. The predicted influence of the input gas composition, one of the important governing factors of the plasma reactions leading to ammonia production, is compared with observations. The influence of the excitation frequency and duty cycle on the yield and energy efficiency are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc23/731.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qjXQJ1EsaIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
