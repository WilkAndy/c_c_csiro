The ball left a residue, both at the position of the first bounce, and also its second contact with the wood. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements showed that these residues contain silicon, aluminium, calcium, titanium, sulphur and iron. The results suggest that the ball has a core of positive ions, probably remaining from the initial formation of the ball, as a result of lightning arc melting. Theoretical calculations have been made of the development of a sphere of positive ions of density of 1010 cm-3 with radius 10 cm. Plasma formed by ionization at the edge of the sphere produces a shell of near-zero electric field that impedes dispersion of the ions occurring from self-repulsion. After a millisecond, the sphere develops to have equal densities of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.labofoudre.com/app/download/23505715/ISL-SRP+2017+Proceedings+-+John+LOWKE+-+Bouncing+ball+lighting+and+theoretical+predictions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tPPl3MpRyaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
