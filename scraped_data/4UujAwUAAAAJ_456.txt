In the case of low temperatures, the problem is solved analytically for free-burning and wall-stabilized electric arcs. For a wider temperature range, the problem is solved by numerical simulation. The temperature profile for the free-burning electric arc was obtained using a Gaussian approximation of experimental results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://vant.kipt.kharkov.ua/ANNOTAZII_2002/annotazii_2002_5_124.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
