The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, were performed for pressures from 0.1 to 5 atm and for the temperature range 300-30 000 K. Some of the results are compared with those of previously published studies, and the influence of molybdenum vapor is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc23/803.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v2n3zeNrJBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
