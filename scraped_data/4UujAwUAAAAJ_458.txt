The results show the effect of mixing of plasma species on the arc performance for currents 150-400 A. Calculated radial temperature and velocity profiles exhibit very good qualitative and quantitative agreements with measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc23/301.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Is3fwBuzQ7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
