Our study shows that CAP has the potential to eradicate antimicrobial-resistant biofilm bacteria. We also discover that low doses may lead to the surviving bacteria being more resistant to subsequent plasma exposure. We provide strong evidence that the resistance is associated with production of the redox-active pigment phenazine by the bacteria."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc22/P-III-10-22.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qvgx6MvO6-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
