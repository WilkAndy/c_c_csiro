Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma (CAP) treatment of cotton seeds prior to planting may help alleviate this problem. CAP is ionised gas that has a range of biological activities due to the formation of a mix of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), excited molecules, charged particles and UV photons. Our results show that a 27 minutes CAP treatment using air can significantly increase water absorption of the seed, and improve warm germination, metabolic chill test germination and chilling tolerance in cotton. We also observe that the beneficial effect of CAP treatment is long-lasting and stable as improved germination activity is still seen when treatment occurs 4 months before germination testing, suggesting that future large-scale \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12130489663740815387", "cites_id": ["12130489663740815387"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-018-32692-9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G6jRPhQoWKgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 8, "2020": 16, "2021": 24, "2022": 30, "2023": 10}}
