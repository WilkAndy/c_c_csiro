The importance of including the arc in the computational domain is demonstrated. A userfriendly graphical user interface has recently been added. As well as weld depth and geometry and arc properties, the model predicts thermal histories of the welded metal. This will allow important quantities such as residual stress and distortion to be predicted."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc22/O-21-1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-6f1oIrktO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
