A two-dimensional model has been used to determine electric field strengths and charge densities around a capped cylinder. A comparison is made of the development of the streamers including and excluding the dependence of the ionization coefficients on the electron density."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc22/O-11-4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uuVD5QWQu7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
