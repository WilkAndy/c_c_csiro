Oxygenated nanodiamonds were found to increase the production yield of ammonia, while hydrogenated nanodiamonds decreased the yield. Initial investigations of the role of different functional groups on the catalyst surface in ammonia synthesis are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/ispc22/O-12-1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wZ2pEGzmxvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
