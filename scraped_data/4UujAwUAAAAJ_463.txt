The model treats electromagnetic, \ufb01uid dynamic and chem\u2014ical kinetic phenomena. Calculated temperature, \ufb02ow and species concentration \ufb01elds within the plasma torch, the injection manifold and the reaction tube, are presented for the case of the destruction of CFC\u201412. The predictions of the model are found to be in good agreement with measurements of the exhaust gas composition and reaction tube temperatures. In particular, the formation of CFC-13, which has been found to be a limiting factor in the effectiveness of the destruction of ozonewdepleting substances, is predicted by the model. ll, ENTRODUCTION Thermal plasmas provide an effective means of destruction of ozone-deple-ting substances (ODSS), such as chloro\ufb02uorocarbons (CFCs) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://plas.ep2.rub.de/ispcdocs/ispc13/content/13/13-1754.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wdxiORpMG5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
