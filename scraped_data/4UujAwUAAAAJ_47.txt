Xu et al. [Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells 91 (2007) 938] recently reported significant incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) at visible wavelengths for carbon-doped TiO2 in thin film and nanotube form. Evidence is given here that these results were due to an artefact in the measurements. Further, it is pointed out that the mechanism proposed for water splitting under visible illumination is unphysical, and the photocurrents presented are shown to be grossly inconsistent with the IPCE data. Other workers have also measured non-zero IPCEs at visible wavelengths for carbon-doped TiO2, but have not presented this as evidence of water splitting. In other cases, carbon doping was performed in a reducing atmosphere, and measured visible activity is most likely a result of oxygen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2358912902063781763", "cites_id": ["2358912902063781763"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024807004059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g_eYT8mKvCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
