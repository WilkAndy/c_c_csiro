Metal oxides are often used as the semiconductor photoelectrode material due to their stability in strong aqueous electrolytes. A photoelectrochemical cell operates by absorbing photons of sufficient energy to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the semiconductor (in this work n-type). Once in the conducting state, the excited electrons are transferred via an external circuit to a counter electrode where they can participate in a hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the holes in the valence band accumulate at the electrolyte interface where they accept electrons from the aqueous solution resulting in the evolution of oxygen gas as shown in Figure 1. A more complete description of the process is given by Nozik and Memming (1996)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15621966555869656021&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1bOkV9BfzNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
