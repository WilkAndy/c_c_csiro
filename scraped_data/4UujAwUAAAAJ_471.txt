However, there is still a lack of practical understanding of the physical behavior in the electrode region. For example, current attachment at thermionic cathode is not clear yet. The emitter materials such as ThO2, p La2O3, etc would not affect only work function of the cathode but also current attachment at the cathode."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.jwri.osaka-u.ac.jp/~conf/Visual-JW2010/Visual-JW2010_sample.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VMCYWJ_FVIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
