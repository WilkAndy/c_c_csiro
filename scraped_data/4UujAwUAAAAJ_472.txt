It was found that by pulsing the microwave energy with a 50% duty cycle, the average power required to sustain a microwave-induced plasma discharge was decreased by about 40%. The ratio of absorbed to incident power was unaffected. These findings were confirmed for pulse frequencies from 10 to 300 Hz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9101151940044196420&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RAoxMXjJTX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
