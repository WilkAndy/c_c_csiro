In addition, combined ordinary, pressure, and thermal diffusion coefficients are given for the gas mixtures. These three combined diffusion coefficients fully describe di fusion of the two gases, irrespective of their degree of dissociation or ionizati on. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed! for atmospheric-pressure plasmas in the temperature range /torn 300 to 30,000 K. A number of the collision integrals used in calculating the transport coefficients are significantly more accurate than values used in previous theoretical studies, resulting in more reliable values of the transport coefficients. The results are compared with those of published theoretical and experimental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 573, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18175676168174164727", "cites_id": ["18175676168174164727"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01570207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:99qNFC35PPwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 6, "1996": 8, "1997": 9, "1998": 6, "1999": 4, "2000": 8, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 14, "2004": 10, "2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 18, "2008": 14, "2009": 18, "2010": 22, "2011": 28, "2012": 36, "2013": 25, "2014": 26, "2015": 45, "2016": 31, "2017": 31, "2018": 27, "2019": 28, "2020": 40, "2021": 33, "2022": 31, "2023": 15}}
