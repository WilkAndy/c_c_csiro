Combined ordinary, pressure, temperature and electric field diffusion coefficients are also given for the mixtures. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for plasmas in the temperature range from 300 to 30,000K and the pressure range from 0.1 to 5atm. The results are compared with those of previously published studies. Reasonable and in some cases very good agreement is found; those discrepancies that exist are attributed to the improved values of the some of the collision integrals used here. Different mixing rules are tested, with two found to give very good results: that of Yun et al. [K.-S. Yun, S. Weissman, E.A. Mason, Phys. Fluids 5 (1962) 672] for the viscosity and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8774626398197404427", "cites_id": ["8774626398197404427"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010411002552", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C1NSHTi8xXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 11, "2023": 8}}
