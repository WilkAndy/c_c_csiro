These gases have received much attention as alternatives to SF 6 for use in circuit breakers, due to the low global warming potential and good dielectric properties of C 4 F 7 N. Since the parameters of the large molecules formed in the dissociation of C 4 F 7 N are unavailable, the partition function and enthalpy of formation were calculated using computational chemistry methods. From the equilibrium composition calculations, it was found that when C 4 F 7 N is mixed with CO 2, CO 2 can capture C atoms from C 4 F 7 N, producing CO, since the system consisting of small molecules such as CF 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10765673299358709877", "cites_id": ["10765673299358709877"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aab421/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dfguqNNaZ5UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 28, "2020": 19, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
