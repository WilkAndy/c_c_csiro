The cut-off of the partition functions due to the lowering of the ionization potential has been taken into account, together with the contributions from different core excited electronic states. The species composition and thermodynamic properties are determined numerically using the Newton\u2013Raphson iterative method, taking into account the corrections due to Coulomb interactions. The transport properties including diffusion coefficient, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity are calculated using the most recent collision interaction potentials by adopting Devoto\u2019s electron and heavy particle decoupling approach, expanded to the third-order approximation (second-order for viscosity) in the framework of Chapman\u2013Enskog method. Results are presented in the pressure range of 0.1 atm\u201310 atm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2557621325018128237", "cites_id": ["2557621325018128237"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3657426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bV-rUwt_fiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
