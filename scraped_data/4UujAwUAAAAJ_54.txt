The nanoparticles are embedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium, and the finite thermal resistance at the interface between the nanoparticle and the medium is taken into account. An analytic solution is derived for the case of a single nanoparticle. The T-matrix method is used to calculate the energy absorption efficiency of groups of nanoparticles, taking into account their optical interactions. Heat transfer equations are developed that take into account thermal interactions between nanoparticles. The equations are solved numerically using the finite element software COMSOL. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to treat the thermal interactions between the nanoparticles for arrays of nanoparticles. Results are presented for illumination by a standard xenon flash lamp.
