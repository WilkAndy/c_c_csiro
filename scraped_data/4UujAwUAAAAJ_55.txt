These byproducts are chemically active and have been shown experimentally to be associated with discharge faults. However, the relationships between the discharges and types of decomposition components are still not clear, mainly due to the fact that the complex chemical processes during SF 6 discharges are not fully understood. In order to comprehensively investigate the decomposition of SF 6, an approach combining density functional theory (DFT) and transition state theory (TST) was used to study the pathways of SF 6 decomposition in mixtures with H 2 O and O 2 that involve electrically-neutral species. The complex chemical reactions were analyzed, and the corresponding rate constants were predicted.
