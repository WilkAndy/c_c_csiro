Three preparation techniques were used: first ballmilling sulfur powder with Degussa P25 powder (P25), second, ball milling thiourea with P25, and third a sol\u2013gel technique involving titanium (IV) butoxide and thiourea. The resulting powders were heat-treated and thin-film electrodes were prepared. In all three cases, the heat-treated powders contained small amounts of S (1\u20133%). However, Rietveld analysis on X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed no significant changes in lattice parameters. For the samples prepared using thiourea, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated the presence of N and C in the heat-treated powders in addition to S. In all cases, visible-ultraviolet spectroscopy performed on bulk powders confirmed the extension of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1846116525127836898", "cites_id": ["1846116525127836898"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-007-2309-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4iQ5zjK5nhkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 12, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
