These effects have been attributed, on the basis of different computational models, to either the increased radiative emission associated with the presence of metal vapour in the arc plasma, or the influence of the metal vapour influx on convective flow in the arc. This question is investigated using a three-dimensional computational model in which the production and the transport of metal vapour are taken into account self-consistently. Parameters relevant to welding of thin sheets of aluminum are examined. For these conditions, it is found that the first effect (the decrease in temperature throughout the arc) is due to both the increased radiative emission and the influence of the metal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9230963387454623060", "cites_id": ["9230963387454623060"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/46/22/224004/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VI3eC0v4GoAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 9, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
