The various scattering processes that can occur a light passes through such a plasma are outlined. It is shown that while Rayleigh scattering by ground-state atoms is the dominant process at low temperatures, Thomson scattering becomes important at temperatures at which significant ionization occurs. Resonance scattering is also a significant source of scattered radiation when the laser wavelength is approximately equal to the wavelength of a transition of a species present in the plasma. Radial profiles of the polarized and depolarized radiation scattered from argon and helium arcs have been measured and analysed to confirm the relative importance of the respective scattering mechanisms. The occurrence of Thomson scattering is found to set a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11122585155343516946", "cites_id": ["11122585155343516946"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/25/4/009/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EoVI0ERcW5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
