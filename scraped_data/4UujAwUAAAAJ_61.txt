The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, were performed for pressures from 1 to 100 atm and for the temperature range 300\u201330 000 K. The results were compared with those of previously published studies. Some discrepancies were found for krypton and xenon; these are attributed to the improved values of the collision integrals used here in calculating the transport coefficients."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15745286140907864515", "cites_id": ["15745286140907864515"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/47/29/295202/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w8Gxs1J-gtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
