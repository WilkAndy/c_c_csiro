The equilibrium compositions of different SF6\u2013N2 mixtures at several gas pressures and temperatures up to 3000\u2009K were first calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy under the assumptions of local thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium. The electron energy distribution function was then obtained using the composition data by Boltzmann equation analysis. It was found that adding N2 to SF6 gas can markedly reduce the kinetic energy of electrons at relatively high gas temperatures, which enhances the dielectric field strength. Finally, the critical reduced electric field (E/N)cr, defined as the value for which ionization is equal to attachment, of hot SF6\u2013N2 mixtures was determined. The results indicate that in the gas temperature range around 2000\u20133000\u2009K \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4791420481772893304", "cites_id": ["4791420481772893304"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4798596", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eLSayYqLfkIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
