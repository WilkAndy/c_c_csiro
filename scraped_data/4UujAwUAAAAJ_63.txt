The mathematical model of three-dimensional air arc plasma considering electrode erosion is built based on magnetic hydrodynamics. The mass fraction equation of copper vapor is introduced to the model on the basis of traditional mass, momentum, and energy balance equations. The influence of copper vapor on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the gas mixture is considered in this paper. The distributions of temperature field, gas flow field, and mass fraction of copper vapor in the arc chamber are simulated. The arc root displacements and arc voltage, which takes account of the influence of electrode erosion, are calculated. The simulation results indicate that the immobility time of both moving contact and stationary contact is much longer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15933940579653261276", "cites_id": ["15933940579653261276"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3176983", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3BdqGom6IN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
