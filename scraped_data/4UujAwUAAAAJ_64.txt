Plasma activation can potentially circumvent the limitations of conventional thermocatalytic ammonia synthesis; however, the contribution of different reaction mechanisms to the production of ammonia at the catalyst surface remains unclear. Here, we identify the reaction intermediates adsorbed on \u03b3-Al2O3-supported Ni and Fe catalysts during plasma-activated ammonia synthesis under various temperatures and reactor configurations using FTIR spectroscopy, steady-state flow reactor experiments, and computational kinetic modeling. Ammonia yield can be influenced by plasma-derived intermediates and their interactions with catalyst surfaces, which lead to different reaction pathways: Ni/\u03b3-Al2O3 enhances plasma-promoted NH3 production and favors surface-adsorbed NHx species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15603816044944559245", "cites_id": ["15603816044944559245"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.0c03166", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jQx2MwXki9gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 22, "2022": 27, "2023": 13}}
