While the beneficial effects of plasma treatment on seed germination, disease resistance and agricultural output have been reported, the mechanisms that underpin the observed biological responses are yet to be fully described. This study employs Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and emission spectroscopy to capture chemical interactions between plasmas and seed surfaces with the aim to provide a more comprehensive account of plasma\u2212seed interactions. FTIR spectroscopy of the seed surface confirms plasma-induced chemical etching of the surface. The etching facilitates permeation of water into the seed, which is confirmed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4975784923535592893", "cites_id": ["4975784923535592893"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-04963-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vU0VbgaKDUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 16, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
