Destruction of liquid and gaseous wastes in the PLASCON\u2122 waste destruction process is used as an example. It is demonstrated that thermochemical calculation of the mixing temperature is a useful tool to predict the level to which wastes are destroyed; however, chemical kinetic calculations are necessary to investigate the formation of byproducts in the process. Computational fluid dynamic modeling is required to obtain temperature and flow fields in two dimensions. When combined with chemical kinetics, composition fields can also be obtained. These points are illustrated using the examples of chlorobenzene and chlorofluorocarbon destruction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17508779710561148841", "cites_id": ["17508779710561148841"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1345884", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qV-QmmGu-_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
