Among the major concerns are greenhouse gases and the resulting global warming problem. Although sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) is the most widely used insulation and arc-interruption medium in electrical power equipment, it is an extremely potent greenhouse gas with a very high global warming potential (GWP). Hence, the global power industry has been actively seeking SF 6-alternative gases for decades. In recent years, much progress has been made in developing promising new gases that have dielectric properties similar to, or even better than, SF 6 but with much lower GWPs. Many engineering-oriented tests have been performed on the technical performance of these gases and some manufacturers have announced their application in pilot projects. However, their large-scale application still seems premature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=465290939057870277", "cites_id": ["465290939057870277"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab6ea1/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xZXA06QLdQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 21, "2022": 22, "2023": 10}}
