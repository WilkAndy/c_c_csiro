Data are presented for the temperature range 300 to 30 000 K, for different concentrations of the metal vapours. The dependence of the properties on metal vapour type and concentration are discussed. Mixtures of argon and metal vapour occur in the arc welding and in other plasma applications. Tabulations of the data are presented, and will be of use in computational modelling of such applications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6365628073278434675", "cites_id": ["6365628073278434675"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/46/41/415207/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c-0DkAFBV1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
