A modified Kubelka-Munk two- flux model is used to calculate the reflectance of the coating as a function of the refractive index, absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, and thickness. The calculated reflectance is then fitted to measurements using a spectral projected gradient algorithm, allowing the optical properties to be obtained. The technique is applied to titanium dioxide coatings on a titanium substrate. Realistic values of refractive index and absorption coefficients are generally obtained. Quantities that are useful for solar water-splitting applications are calculated, including the depth profile of absorption and the proportion of the incident photon flux absorbed in the coating under solar illumination."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5845586019312172850", "cites_id": ["5845586019312172850"], "pub_url": "https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-46-16-3133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mn8XaYOxH1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
