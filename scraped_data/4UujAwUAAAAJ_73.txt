Predictions of arc temperatures, radii, and voltages are compared for argon and mixtures of argon and hydrogen. It is found that arcs in gas mixtures containing hydrogen are more constricted and have a higher maximum temperature and arc voltage than arcs in pure argon. The addition of hydrogen also significantly increases the volume of molten material in the weld pool due to the higher thermal conductivity of argon-hydrogen mixtures at temperatures at which molecules of hydrogen dissociate. Predictions are also compared for workpieces of steel and aluminum. The volume of molten material is very \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10562680207980720172", "cites_id": ["10562680207980720172"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/649597/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LHC9iK8tlpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
