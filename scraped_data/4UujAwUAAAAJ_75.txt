The thermodynamic properties are determined by the method of Gibbs free energy minimization, using standard thermodynamic tables. The transport properties including electron diffusion coefficients, viscosity, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity are evaluated using the Chapman\u2013Enskog method expanded up to the third-order approximation (second order for viscosity). Collision integrals are obtained using the most accurate cross-section data that could be located. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for atmospheric pressure plasmas in the temperature range from 300 to 30 000 K for different pressures between 0.1 and 10 atm. The results are compared with those of previously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5564939300937233540", "cites_id": ["5564939300937233540"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/44/35/355207/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hHT5VM-iOk0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 8}}
