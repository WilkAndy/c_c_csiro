A comprehensive kinetic scheme for the decomposition of CBrClF2, which includes the decomposition of CCl2F2 and CBrF3, is presented. Simulations performed with this scheme, and experimental results, demonstrate the importance of allowing for the interconversion of ODS in the assessment of plasma destruction devices.Both experimental and modeling results show that the efficiency of operation of a practical plasma ODS destruction device can be quantified in terms of a throughput parameter, the feed to plasma power ratio (units mol (kWh)-1), or in terms of the thermochemical mixing temperature, Tm, of the plasma, ODS and oxidant. At low throughputs and high Tm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3976331540414032309", "cites_id": ["3976331540414032309"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015365032020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tWmP73fELjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
