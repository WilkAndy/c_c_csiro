Plasma vitrification of hazardous slags has been a commercial technology for several years, and volume reduction of hazardous wastes using plasma processes is increasingly being used. Plasma gasification of wastes with low negative values has attracted interest as a source of energy and spawned process developments for treatment of even municipal solid wastes. Numerous technologies and approaches exist for plasma treatment of wastes. This review summarizes the approaches that have been developed, presents some of the basic physical principles, provides details of some specific processes and considers the advantages and disadvantages of thermal plasmas in waste \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 348, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=652047580246412836", "cites_id": ["652047580246412836"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/41/5/053001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JI49zdGJDAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 12, "2011": 9, "2012": 22, "2013": 23, "2014": 28, "2015": 19, "2016": 23, "2017": 23, "2018": 33, "2019": 18, "2020": 39, "2021": 25, "2022": 39, "2023": 18}}
