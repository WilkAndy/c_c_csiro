The format of the Roadmap is the same as the previous Roadmaps representing the visions of 41 leading experts representing 21 countries and five continents in the various sub-fields of LTP science and technology. In recognition of the evolution in the field, several new topics have been introduced or given more prominence. These new topics and emphasis highlight increased interests in plasma-enabled additive manufacturing, soft materials, electrification of chemical conversions, plasma propulsion, extreme plasma regimes, plasmas in hypersonics, data-driven plasma science and technology and the contribution of LTP to combat COVID-19. In the last few decades, LTP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9166579688803027590", "cites_id": ["9166579688803027590"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac5e1c/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hkpqDKk7Nn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 13, "2023": 40}}
