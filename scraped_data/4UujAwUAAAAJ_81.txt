The critical properties of thermal plasmas are explained in physical terms and their importance in different applications is considered. The characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages, of the different main types of thermal plasmas (transferred and non-transferred arcs, radio-frequency inductively-coupled plasmas and microwave plasmas) are discussed. The methods by which flow is stabilized in arc plasmas are considered. The important concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is explained, leading into a discussion of the importance of thermophysical properties, and their calculation in LTE and two-temperature plasmas. The standard equations for modelling thermal plasmas are presented and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4144448187704231624", "cites_id": ["4144448187704231624"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6595/aabdce/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yEYfIqsJhDkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 20, "2021": 10, "2022": 16, "2023": 1}}
