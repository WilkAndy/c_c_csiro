A fume formation model consisting of a heterogeneous condensation model, a homogeneous nucleation model and a coagulation model has been developed and coupled with the GTA or GMA welding model. A series of processes from evaporation of metal vapour to fume formation from the metal vapour was totally investigated by employing this simulation model. The aim of this paper is to visualize the fume formation process and clarify the fume formation mechanism theoretically through a numerical analysis. Furthermore, the reliability of the simulation model was also evaluated through a comparison of the simulation result with the experimental result. As a result, it was found that the size of the secondary particles consisting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17014142565906445037", "cites_id": ["17014142565906445037"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/43/434012/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7fK01oRgHuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 11, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
