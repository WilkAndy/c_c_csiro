The use of a mixture of carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and SF6 is examined here. It is known that this reduces the breakdown voltage at room temperature. However, the electrical breakdown in a circuit breaker after arc interruption occurs in a hot gas environment, with a complicated species composition because of the occurrence of dissociation and other reactions. The likelihood of breakdown depends on the electron interactions with all these species. The critical reduced electric field strength (the field at which breakdown can occur, relative to the number density) of hot SF6/CF4 mixtures corresponding to the dielectric recovery phase of a high voltage circuit breaker is calculated in the temperature range from 300\u2009K to 3500\u2009K.
