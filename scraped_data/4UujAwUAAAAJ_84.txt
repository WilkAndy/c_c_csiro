The reduced ionization coefficient \u03b1/N and reduced attachment coefficient \u03b7/N are calculated, allowing the reduced effective ionization coefficient (\u03b1\u2013\u03b7)/N and the critical reduced electric field strength (E/N) cr (the reduced electric field for which (\u03b1\u2013\u03b7)/N= 0), to be determined. A high value of (E/N) cr for an electronegative gas, such as those considered here, indicates good insulating properties. It is found that cC 4 F 8\u2013N 2 and cC 4 F 8\u2013air have very similar (E/N) cr values, higher than those of the other three mixtures, and superior even to that of pure SF 6 for cC 4 F 8 concentrations above 80%. Comparison of the results obtained for cC 4 F 8 and cC 4 F 8\u2013N 2 with experimental values from the literature supports the validity of the approach taken here and the parameters \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16226074117582244223", "cites_id": ["16226074117582244223"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/47/42/425204/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f0mmxXCYLuEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 14, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 3}}
