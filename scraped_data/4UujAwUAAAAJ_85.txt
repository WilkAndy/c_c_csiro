Initially, the equilibrium compositions of SF6\u2013CF4 mixtures were calculated by minimizing the Gibbs free energy under the assumptions of local thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium. Then the electron energy distribution function was obtained based on those data by solving the Boltzmann equation under the zero-dimensional two-term spherical harmonic approximation. Finally, the critical reduced electric field strength (E/N)cr of SF6\u2013CF4 mixtures, which is defined as the value for which total ionization reaction is equal to total attachment reaction, were determined and analyzed. The results confirm the superior breakdown properties of pure SF6 at relatively low gas temperatures. However, for higher gas temperatures (i.e., T\u2009>\u20092200\u2009K at 0.4\u2009MPa), the (E \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12461808460507549381", "cites_id": ["12461808460507549381"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4817370", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xY6C88Q88awJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
