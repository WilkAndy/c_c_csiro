The discharge consisted of a large number of microdischarges. The discharge current had a large number of pulses superimposed on a dc background current. The background current increased with decreasing bead size and decreased as the separation between the disc and the electrode increased. The current had an extremely slow and nonlinear transient behaviour when the dc high-voltage source was switched on. The frequency of the current pulses decreased with increasing bead size and disc-electrode separation. The average amplitude of the pulses, in contrast, increased with increasing bead size and disc-electrode separation. A significant dependence of the properties of the current pulses on the polarity of the applied voltage was observed, although the dc current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11704780226480255418", "cites_id": ["11704780226480255418"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/33/12/310/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ujFf9Zm7b6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
