Other applications are already more established, such as for air pollution control, eg volatile organic compound remediation, particulate matter and NO x removal. In addition, plasma is also very promising for catalyst synthesis and treatment. Plasma catalysis clearly has benefits over'conventional'catalysis, as outlined in the Introduction. However, a better insight into the underlying physical and chemical processes is crucial. This can be obtained by experiments applying diagnostics, studying both the chemical processes at the catalyst surface and the physicochemical mechanisms of plasma-catalyst interactions, as well as by computer modeling. The key challenge is to design \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 310, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5586626022586794832", "cites_id": ["5586626022586794832"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ab9048/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UEM9scSuh00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 16, "2021": 104, "2022": 115, "2023": 72}}
