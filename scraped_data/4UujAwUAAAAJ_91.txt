Process", "volume": "12", "pages": "255-336", "abstract": "The advanced techniques that have been applied to the computational modelling of thermal plasmas in the last ten to fifteen years are reviewed. The techniques considered include three-dimensional and time-dependent models, sophisticated treatments of plasma turbulence and radiative transfer, modelling of demixing and of deviations from thermal and chemical equilibrium, and modelling of multiphase flows, including the interactions between plasmas and solid particles, and plasma-liquid interfaces. Many illustrative examples are presented, and the question of which advanced techniques should be applied in which situation is considered."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=625388852620685997", "cites_id": ["625388852620685997"], "pub_url": "https://www.dl.begellhouse.com/journals/57d172397126f956,0ab60eae55d2f4ec,6cfd022a2a65217b.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rfLxFtnTrQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
