The whole region of gas tungsten arc atmosphere including the tungsten cathode, arc plasma and weld pool was treated using a unified numerical model. A viscosity approximation was used to express the diffusion coefficient in terms of viscosity of shielding gas and metal vapour. The transient two-dimensional distributions of the temperature, velocity of plasma flow and iron vapour concentration were predicted, together with the weld penetration as a function of time for a 150 A arc current at the atmospheric pressure, both for helium and argon welding gases.It was shown that the thermal plasma in gas tungsten arcs is influenced by iron vapour from the weld pool surface and that the concentration of iron vapour in plasma is dependent on the temperature of the weld pool."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12223915271594437022", "cites_id": ["12223915271594437022"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174329308X319235", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nunbpywSpKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
