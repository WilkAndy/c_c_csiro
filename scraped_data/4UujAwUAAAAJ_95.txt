The dominant demixing process at high temperatures in an atmospheric-pressure nitrogen-argon arc is predicted to be that associated with frictional forces. Spectroscopic measurements of the mass fraction distribution, which provide experimental confirmation of this demixing effect, are presented. It is shown that demixing can act to either increase or decrease the mass fraction of nitrogen as temperature increases, depending on the gas composition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1738908453619077059", "cites_id": ["1738908453619077059"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.1797", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w4_jggbYIRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
