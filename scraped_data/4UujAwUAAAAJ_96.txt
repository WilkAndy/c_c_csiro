The mathematical model employed in the tool considers energy, momentum and mass transfer between three interacting domains: the filler wire (anode), the arc plasma, and the workpiece (cathode), which includes the molten pool. The mass, momentum and heat transfer associated with the droplets are also considered. The tool is used to model a bead-on-Al-plate problem and validated by comparing predicted and measured weld profiles. The energy input, transformation, transfer, dissipation due to different physical processes are calculated and analyzed to understand the energy structure and flow in the system for a range of welding currents. The energy efficiency, which is the ratio of the energy consumed in melting the metal to the total energy input into the system \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8599811130013711011", "cites_id": ["8599811130013711011"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931013007953", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o_rqs6iqWHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
