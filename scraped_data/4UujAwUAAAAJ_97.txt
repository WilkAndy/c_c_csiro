The model couples the plasma flow with electromagnetic fields in a self-consistent manner. The electrons and heavy species are assumed to have different temperatures. The species composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients of the plasma under non-LTE conditions are calculated from fundamental theory. The model is then applied to a two-dimensional axisymmetric SF 6 arc burning in a supersonic nozzle under well-controlled conditions; for this configuration, experimental results are available for comparison. The effect of turbulence is considered using the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8077703180828714440", "cites_id": ["8077703180828714440"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/46/6/065203/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yKVW1j7EGXAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
