It is demonstrated that balancing of the Ge influx from the plasma against surface diffusion provides an effective control of the surface processes and can result in the formation of very small densely packed quantum dots. In the supply-controlled mode, a continuous layer is formed which is then followed by the usual Stranski\u2013Krastanow fragmentation with a nanocluster size of 10 nm. In the diffusion-controlled mode, with the oversupply relative to the surface diffusion rate, nanoclusters with a characteristic size of 3 nm are formed. Higher temperatures change the mode to supply controlled and thus encourage formation of the continuous layer that then fragments into an array of large size. The use of a high rate of deposition, easily accessible using plasma \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13590372456990933128", "cites_id": ["13590372456990933128"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/41/9/092001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iIAyqL6zmrwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
