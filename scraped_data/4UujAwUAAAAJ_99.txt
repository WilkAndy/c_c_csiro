The datasets were collected with a beam energy of 30 keV at the Australian Synchrotron. Three-dimensional (3D) distributions of porosity in the Ti sample were reconstructed using a data-constrained modelling (DCM) technique. Quantitative analysis indicated that the heat treatment caused morphological changes to the pores and a small decrease in the overall porosity. After heat treatment, some fine porosity disappeared while the large porosity regions were essentially unaffected except for a change towards a more rounded pore shape. Interconnectivity between pores was reduced, which has implications for sealing and trapping of contaminant gases in cold-sprayed parts. The characterization technique and the workflow presented in the paper are applicable to non-destructive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "4UujAwUAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13341509475697596318", "cites_id": ["13341509475697596318"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044580317312251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:npd2ii6QJrkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
