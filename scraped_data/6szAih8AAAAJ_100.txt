In this paper, we report that the method is effective for the quantitative determination of hydroxy, primary amino and carboxy end-groups of polymers with M\u00afn<50,000gmol\u22121. It may also be applied to detect chain ends in higher molecular weight polymers. The signals for the imidic (and, in the case of amines, amidic) hydrogens appear in a region (\u03b4 7.5\u201311) that is clear of other signals in the case of most aliphatic polymers and many aromatic polymers such as polystyrene and poly(ethylene terephthalate). The method has been applied in the characterization of polymers formed by conventional and living radical polymerization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17849744673798536662", "cites_id": ["17849744673798536662"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032386106000772", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1r0udTUIt_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
