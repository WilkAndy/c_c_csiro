For the three monomers the ratio of hydrogen abstraction to double bond addition was found to increase and the ratio of head against tail addition to decrease in the series: benzoyloxy; phenyl; t-butoxy. Relative rates for these reactions have been determined and the factors influencing the mode of reaction are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16937173981559793902", "cites_id": ["16937173981559793902"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch9831573", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7ijczf_tDOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
