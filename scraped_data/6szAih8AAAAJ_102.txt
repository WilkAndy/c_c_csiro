Analysis of the products formed when benzoyl peroxide is decomposed in styrene at 60\u00b0C in the presence of a radical trapping agent (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) shows that the reaction of benzoyloxy radicals with styrene proceeds with 80% \u201ctail\u201d addition, 5% \u201chead\u201d addition, and 15% aromatic substitution. Phenyl radicals (formed by decarboxylation of benzoyloxy radicals) also may add to either the double bond or the aromatic ring of styrene. The importance of the above-mentioned processes to the structure and properties of benzoyl-peroxide-initiated polystyrene is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4710010086412187266", "cites_id": ["4710010086412187266"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222338208056465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gvYaCThRXUEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
