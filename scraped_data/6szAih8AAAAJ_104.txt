These data have been assessed with reference to our previously reported data on chain transfer of MMA macromonomers in MMA polymerizations. The transfer constants (Ctr) for MMA3 in polymerizations of methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate at 60 \u00b0C are similar (\u223c0.18).
