The most effective compatibiliser in this context appears to be a low molecular weight triblock (Kraton G1652). Addition of only 5% Kraton G1652 affords a ca. three-fold improvement in the impact strength for a 1:1 PP/PS blend over the uncompatibilised blend and leads to near HIPS impact strength for a 1:1 LDPE/PS blend. This compatibiliser is as effective as a high molecular weight tapered diblock and appears to be substantially more effective than either low molecular weight diblocks or a higher molecular weight triblock."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13466370853778283", "cites_id": ["13466370853778283"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00587891", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:azMny5fXLwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 7, "1998": 6, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2}}
