The method, exemplified by styrene\u2013divinylbenzene copolymerization in the presence of 2-cyano-2-propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate, provides control over polymerization kinetics, monolith morphology and surface functionality. Kinetic studies of monolith formation show a period of slow copolymerization, with a rate similar to RAFT homopolymerization of styrene, followed by rapid copolymerization, with a rate similar to that observed in conventional styrene\u2013divinylbenzene copolymerization. The time to onset of rapid polymerization (gelation) and the monolith morphology depend strongly on the RAFT agent concentration. The RAFT-synthesized monoliths show a modified morphology with smaller pores \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5333106230995819726", "cites_id": ["5333106230995819726"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/py/c3py01015e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zpztb9z_AkoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
