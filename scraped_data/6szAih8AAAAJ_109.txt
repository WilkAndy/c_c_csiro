These com pounds have the ability to ring open during polymerisation and provide examples of allylic monomers that will readily polymerise to high molecular weight polymers. Monomers capable of ring opening (hereinafter referred to as \u201cring-opening monomers') are important in minimis ing Volume shrinkage during polymerisation. Additionally, ring-opening monomers are useful in providing an alterna tive method of incorporating functionalities Such as amide, ester or carbonate into the backbone of a polymer. Generally, Such functionalities are introduced by Step growth (ie poly esterification) polymerisation rather than chain growth (ie free radical and ionic) polymerisation. The limitations of Step growth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6693080490829803243,13971755052164696567,3463659670321175952", "cites_id": ["6693080490829803243", "13971755052164696567", "3463659670321175952"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US6043361A/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6-4BtT6Z4lwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
