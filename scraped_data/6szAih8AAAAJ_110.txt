The deviation from \u201cexpected\u201d behaviour is frequently attributed to the presence of structural irregularities within the polymer molecule. However, the precise nature of these groups, though the subject of much speculation, is often unclear1-3). In this light a detailed investigation of the selectivity of the various stages of free radical induced vinyl polymerization becomes of paramount importance. Recently, we have begun a systematic investigation of reactions of free radicals with commercially important vinyl monomers4-lo) and have demonstrated how product analyses of the decomposition of free radical initiators in vinyl monomers in the presence of a nitroxide radical scavenger can provide a quantitative description of the processes involved. For example, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17177934431015539647,6003257793329810593", "cites_id": ["17177934431015539647", "6003257793329810593"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.1982.030030802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vxOiN1pIZO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 6, "1985": 2, "1986": 3, "1987": 4, "1988": 2, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
