The cyanomethyl and benzyl dithiocarbamates offer very low dispersities (\u0110 < 1.1) for polymers based on more activated monomers [MAMs: methyl acrylate (MA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and styrene (St)] and \u0110 < 1.3 in polymerization of vinyl acetate (VAc), a less activated monomer (LAM). The tertiary, 2-cyano-2-butyl dithiocarbamate, provides molar mass control and \u0110 < 1.5 in methyl methacrylate (MMA) polymerization. Lower dispersities can be obtained for MMA copolymers. End group fidelity was proved with the synthesis of block copolymers, poly(DMA)-block-poly(MA). With the ability to control polymerization of both MAMs and LAMs, the RAFT agents were also shown to be suitable for the synthesis of a poly(MAM)-block-poly(LAM), specifically poly(DMA)-block \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4571836204766986959", "cites_id": ["4571836204766986959"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/py/c5py01382h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zwJoPM5scj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 16, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
