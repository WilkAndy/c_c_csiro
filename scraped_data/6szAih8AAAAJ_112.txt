In this work, the benefits of well-plate-based HTP polymerization and flow-mediated chemistry are used to streamline the screening and upscaling of value-added biomedical materials through a robust photopolymerization strategy, namely, photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization. A library of potential antimicrobial polymers was generated from an initial pool of monomers and tested for their activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The antimicrobial activity of the most promising candidates was then elucidated through structure\u2013property analyses performed via both plate and flow polymerization processes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:cRMvf6lLvU8C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1719743016016301768", "cites_id": ["1719743016016301768"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yE6cVinB3RcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 21, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
