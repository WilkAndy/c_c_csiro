In the present work, we have developed a methodology based on reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer polymerization that allows the synthesis of multiblock copolymers based on sequential aqueous emulsion polymerization using the three most common industrially employed monomer families in emulsion polymerization systems: methacrylates, acrylates, and styrene. By exploiting the segregation effect (compartmentalization) resulting from polymerization within polymeric nanoparticles, a high molecular weight multiblock copolymer (up to 140,000 g\u00b7mol\u20131) is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:bXQfdp6S9ecC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14940028585075947012", "cites_id": ["14940028585075947012"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b00257", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BDaiq9ekVc8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 11, "2021": 17, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
