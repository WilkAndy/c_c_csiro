This paper will briefly trace the historical development of RAFT with reference to the kinetics and mechanism of the process. It will also highlight the most recent developments in our laboratories at CSIRO during the period 2011-2014 specifically covering such areas as kinetics and mechanism, RAFT agent development, end-group transformation, RAFT crosslinking polymerization, monomer sequence control and multi-block copolymer synthesis, and high throughput RAFT polymerization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Zh0EY9V9P6UC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3590945405127550013", "cites_id": ["3590945405127550013"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2015-1187.ch012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PeRyANKZ1TEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
