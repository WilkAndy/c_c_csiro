In several cases there is a competition between solvent and methyl methacrylate for reaction with t-butoxy radicals. The implications of these findings for polymer structure are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4068087868239952621", "cites_id": ["4068087868239952621"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch9832447", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7bqEzVzAdDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 3, "1986": 0, "1987": 4, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
