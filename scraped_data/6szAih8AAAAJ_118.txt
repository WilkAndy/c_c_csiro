Radical addition\u2013fragmentation processes have been exploited in synthetic organic chemistry since the early 1970s [1\u20133]. Allyl transfer reactions with allyl stannanes and the Barton\u2013McCombie deoxygenation process with xanthates are just two examples. Chain transfer to monomer in vinyl chloride polymerization may be considered as the first reported example of addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer in a polymerization context. However, the first reports of the use of deliberately added addition\u2013fragmentation transfer agents in controlling polymerization appeared in the late 1980s [4\u201310]. Polymerizations with reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer which showed some of the characteristics of living polymerization were first reported in 1995 [11]. The macromonomer RAFT agents used in that work are described in section 3.1. 2.
