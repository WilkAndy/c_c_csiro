The method takes advantage of the large increase in fluorescence quantum yield that occurs when a nitroxide containing a suitable fluorophore couples with a carbon-centered radical. The technique is applied to PLP experiments which involve photolysis of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) or azobis(methyl isobutyrate) (AIBMe) in the presence of 4-(1-naphthoyloxy)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (NTEMPO). In these experiments, the method is shown to be capable of reliably measuring transient radical concentrations of less than 10-7 M. Various side reactions that might complicate the technique are considered and shown not to be of significance. The concentration of radicals generated per pulse is shown to have a linear dependence on [AIBN \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=93173803797677836,12506060273717734308", "cites_id": ["93173803797677836", "12506060273717734308"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp990892t", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DIe7tRQFSwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 8, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
