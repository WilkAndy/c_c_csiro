Guidelines for the selection of RAFT agents are presented. The utility of the RAFT process is then illustrated with several examples of the synthesis of polymers with reactive end-groups. Thus, RAFT polymerization with appropriately designed trithiocarbonate RAFT agents is successfully applied to the synthesis of narrow polydispersity carboxy-functional poly(methyl methacrylate) and primary amino-functional polystyrene. Methods for removing the thiocarbonylthio end-group by aminolysis, reduction and thermal elimination are discussed. It is shown that the thiocarbonylthio end-group can be cleanly cleaved by radical induced reduction with tri-n-butylstannane, to leave a saturated chain end, or by thermolysis, to leave an unsaturated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 961, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8402110034798838093", "cites_id": ["8402110034798838093"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003238610500604X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TQHuc49KmnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 22, "2007": 33, "2008": 39, "2009": 47, "2010": 57, "2011": 59, "2012": 52, "2013": 70, "2014": 66, "2015": 79, "2016": 76, "2017": 66, "2018": 48, "2019": 68, "2020": 62, "2021": 54, "2022": 39, "2023": 18}}
