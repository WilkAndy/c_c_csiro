Analysis of the oligomeric products demonstrates that there is selectivity in the reaction of oligo(methacrylonitrile) radicals (5) with cyanoisopropyl radicals (1). There is a marked preference for C-N coupling over C-C coupling and the major product observed results from combination of the nitrogen of 5 with the carbon of 1. The reaction kinetics of AIBN decomposition and product formation have been analysed to yield absolute rate constants (60\u00b0, benzene) for ketenimine decomposition and for the addition of 1 to methacrylonitrile. The implications of our findings are discussed with respect to the kinetics and mechanism of methacrylonitrile and other polymerizations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6266612451498048165", "cites_id": ["6266612451498048165"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001430579390108R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pbqUnNJ691YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
