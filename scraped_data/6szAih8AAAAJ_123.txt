Each radical studied underwent ring-opening by fission of the more substituted \u03b2\u03b3-bond. In the case of the secondary radical (12b) the new double bond was formed preferentially in the trans-configuration. Rate constants, which cannot be determined with high accuracy by this method, lie in the range 1 \u00d7 107\u20133 \u00d7 108 s\u20131 at 25 \u00b0C. When generated by the flow method in the e.s.r. cavity \u03b1-hydroxycyclopropylmethyl radicals undergo \u03b2-fission followed by 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer to afford enoxyl radicals. The latter reaction occurs more slowly in water than in non-polar solvents. The rigid hydroxynortricyclyl radical (43) undergoes preferential fission of the less substituted \u03b2\u03b3-bond, possibly because of the dipolar nature of the transition state."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7729442203617245878", "cites_id": ["7729442203617245878"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1980/p2/p29800001473", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:trqEWrt-RGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
