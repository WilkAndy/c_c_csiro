The specificity for SUMI over formation of higher oligomers and/or RAFT agent\u2010derived by\u2010products is higher for longer irradiation wavelengths. Red light provides the cleanest product (selective SUMI), showing a linear pseudo\u2010first order kinetic profile to high (>80%) conversion, but also the slowest reaction rate. Blue light provides a relatively rapid reaction, but also gives some by\u2010products (<2%) and the kinetic profile displays a conversion plateau at >65% conversion. Higher specificity with red light is attributed to CTA1 absorbing at longer wavelengths than the SUMI product, which allows selective excitation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:U0iAMwwPxtsC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15387316011838080411", "cites_id": ["15387316011838080411"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.201800240", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mwVKJGO6itUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
