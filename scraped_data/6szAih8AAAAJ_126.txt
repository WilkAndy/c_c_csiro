Phthalimido groups can be quantitatively converted to amine groups by hydrazinolysis according to an Ing\u2013Manske procedure. Approaches based on \u03b1- (functional initiator) and \u03c9-functionalisation (end-group substitution) were examined. Thus, well defined, low molecular weight, \u03c9-bromopolystyrenes, prepared by atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) with copper(I) bromide, 4,4\u2032-di-(nonyl)-2,2\u2032 bipyridine (dNbpy) and 1-bromoethylbenzene initiator, were transformed into \u03c9-phthalimidopolystyrenes by substitution with potassium phthalimide. However, elimination of the terminal bromine to form an unsaturated chain end was observed as a side reaction. Various \u03b1-phthalimidopolystyrenes were successfully prepared using phthalimido-functional initiators \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=571286739778841517", "cites_id": ["571286739778841517"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1381514805001537", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ratoVUOe7QcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
