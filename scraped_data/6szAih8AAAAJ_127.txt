Selection of substituents allows the optimization of chain transfer activity and the preparation of macromonomers and other end\u2010functional polymers from acrylates, methacrylates, styrene and vinyl acetate. The addition\u2010fragmentation concept has been extended to the free radical ring\u2010opening polymerization of cyclic allylic sulfides."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3732083234712770067", "cites_id": ["3732083234712770067"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.19961110103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E9Y-te0FyzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
