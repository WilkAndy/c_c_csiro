The primary objective of this research has been to find dispersants that allow PP nanocomposites to be formed by direct melt mixing, that are effective with unmodified clays and that comprise only a minor component of the overall composition both with respect to both clay and PP. Two classes of dispersants were investigated: PEO\u2010based nonionic surfactants and amphiphilic copolymers based on a long chain (meth)acrylate (e.g. octadecyl acrylate) and a more polar comonomer (e.g. maleic anhydride, N\u2010vinylpyrrolidone, methyl methacrylate). The state of dispersion achieved and the properties of the derived nanocomposites were found to depend strongly on both on the level of dispersant and its overall composition but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2087312530777321593", "cites_id": ["2087312530777321593"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.200690015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eTA0DLCf9xwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 7, "2008": 10, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
