These experiments demonstrate that when a source of fert-butoxy radicals is employed as the initiator for copolymerizationand toluene or butan-2-one is used as the solvent, a majority of end groups may be solvent derived. This is a consequence of the fert-butoxy radicals\u2019 high propensity for hydrogen abstraction. Even with benzene as solvent, there is a significant proportion of solvent attack and resultant phenyl radical initiation. A second major influence of the medium is on the extent to which fert-butoxy radicals either undergo/3-scission or react by addition or abstraction. Finally, with each of the three radicals (t-BuCV, Me', and Ph*), there is a small, yet significant, solvent effect on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1007229959895777334", "cites_id": ["1007229959895777334"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00183a050", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NgC43k9m-g0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 7, "1992": 4, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
