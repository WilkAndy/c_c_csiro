The main factors responsible for the preeminent position of radical polymerization are the ability to polymerize a wide array of monomers, tolerance of unprotected functionality in monomer and solvent, and compatibility with a variety of reaction conditions. Radical polymerization is simple to implement and inexpensive in relation to competitive technologies. However, conventional radical polymerization severely limits the degree of control that researchers can assert over molecular-weight distribution, copolymer composition, and macromolecular architecture.This Account focuses on nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) and polymerization with reversible addition\u2212fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), two of the more successful approaches for controlling radical polymerization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 831, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6900660460984343127,7768729989141574502", "cites_id": ["6900660460984343127", "7768729989141574502"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ar800075n", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VxqOxCASxF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 52, "2010": 87, "2011": 76, "2012": 71, "2013": 72, "2014": 59, "2015": 69, "2016": 55, "2017": 59, "2018": 50, "2019": 44, "2020": 52, "2021": 37, "2022": 29, "2023": 11}}
