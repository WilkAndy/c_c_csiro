The method is particularly suitedto the simulation of co-polymerizations carried out in the presence of chain-transfer agents (eg, thiols). Calculations have been performed to show that selectivity shown in the initiation and termination reactions can have a dramatic influence on the composition and molecular weight distribution of cooligomers and copolymers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=61519072521614667", "cites_id": ["61519072521614667"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00169a035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S_WPQEWP2gAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
