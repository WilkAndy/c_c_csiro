Consistent with earlier work, we find that xanthates and N-aryldithiocarbamates give adequate control (dispersities (\u0110) < 1.3) while dithiobenzoates give marked retardation. However, contrary to popular belief, we find that the polymerization of NVC is best controlled with trithiocarbonate RAFT agents, which provide both good molecular weight control, very narrow dispersities (\u0110 < 1.1), and high end-group fidelity. The results demonstrate that NVC has intermediate reactivity, i.e. between that of the traditional more activated (MAMs; styrene, acrylates) and less activated monomers (LAMs; vinyl \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17546351947985156204", "cites_id": ["17546351947985156204"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/py/c3py00487b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bHij0yEqgfMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 0, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
