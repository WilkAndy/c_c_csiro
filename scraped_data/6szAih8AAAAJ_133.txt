In this paper, the polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone was examined with a series of cyanomethyl N-aryl-N-pyridyldithiocarbamates [(4-R\u2032Ph)N(py)C(S)SCH2CN] varying in the substituent (R\u2032) at the 4-position on the phenyl ring. The polymerization of N-vinylpyrrolidone was best controlled when R\u2032 was methoxy; one of the least active RAFT agents in the series. The preservation of RAFT agent functionality was demonstrated by chain extension experiments with further N-vinylpyrrolidone. Again best control again was found for the RAFT agent with R\u2032 = MeOPh. The utility of this RAFT agent was also proved with the preparation of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:SxCCDk4iOpsC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1332931289000852853,10339259826849596986", "cites_id": ["1332931289000852853", "10339259826849596986"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/py/c5py01021g", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dT3m9vGFfxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 3}}
