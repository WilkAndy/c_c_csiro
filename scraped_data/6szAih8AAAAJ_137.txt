The temperature dependence of the propagation rate constants indicates a frequency factor of 10(6,43 \u00b1 0,26) L \u00b7 mol\u22121 \u00b7 s\u22121 and an activation energy of 29,7 \u00b1 1,5 kJ \u00b7 mol\u22121. These parameters suggest that the relatively slow rate of propagation in MAN polymerization in relation to other common monomers (methyl methacrylate, styrene) can be attributed to the relative steric bulk and stability of the propagation species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17297189090703264854", "cites_id": ["17297189090703264854"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.1995.030161109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VkwhZNX1C_AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 4, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 8, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
