A particular focus of the meeting was radical polymerization with reversible\u2013addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT). The meeting also celebrated the 65th birthday and record of scientific achievement of Dr Ezio Rizzardo (CSIRO Molecular and Health Technologies), a pioneer of reversible deactivation radical polymerization and one of the inventors of the RAFT process.[2, 3] Following welcoming remarks by Dr Greg Simpson (Deputy Chief, CSIRO Molecular and Health Technologies), the conference commenced with a Pleanary lecture by Dr Rizzardo entitled \u2018Perspectives of RAFT polymerization\u2013something old and something new\u2019, in which he announced a new class of \u2018switchable\u2019RAFT agents.[4] Four speakers (Fig. 1) then provided an industrial perspective of the applications of RAFT polymerization with Professor Mike Fryd (on behalf of DuPont)\u2018RAFT technology for microlithographic applications\u2019, Professor Mathias Destarac (on behalf of Rhodia)\u2018Some industrial aspects of the MADIX technology\u2019, Mr Chris Such (Orica/Dulux)\u2018RAFT polymerization\u2013a coating technologists view\u2019, and Kate Dawson (CSIRO)\u2018RAFT\u2013the new horizon\u2019mentioned the commercial availability of research quantities of RAFT agents through Strem [5] and announced the formation of the \u2018RAFT Alliance\u2019. The RAFT Alliance is a CSIRO-facilitated, global knowledge exchange community, enabling members to network and share recent developments in both RAFT-related research findings and industrial applications. It is intended that membership will be free to academia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13752556239143813553,4183999092539631669", "cites_id": ["13752556239143813553", "4183999092539631669"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=bf31c95d5746c7921a0c014d3c0fb0b2915c7bec", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:scG_Cwnl2r4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
