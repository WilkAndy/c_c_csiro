Styrene polymerizations (110 \u00b0C, thermal initiation) were performed for two series of RAFT agents [SC(Z)S\u2212CH2Ph and SC(Z)S\u2212C(Me)2CN]. The chain transfer coefficients decrease in the series where Z is Ph > SCH2Ph \u223c SMe \u223c Me \u223c N-pyrrolo \u226b OC6F5 > N-lactam > OC6H5 > O(alkyl) \u226b N(alkyl)2 (only the first five in this series provide narrow polydispersity polystyrene (< 1.2) in batch polymerization).
