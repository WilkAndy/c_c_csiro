In agreement with the conclusions from related studies of ABS/PC blends, it appears that catalytic impurities in the ABS accentuate the propensity of PET for chain scission. Due to the cocontinuous structure of the blend, the hydrolytic or thermomechanical degradation of the PET results in a dramatic loss in mechanical properties which can be explained by the entanglement theory for fracture and the Orowan brittle\u2013ductile hypothesis. \u00a9 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5867097599887716027", "cites_id": ["5867097599887716027"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4628(19961205)62:10%3C1709::AID-APP22%3E3.0.CO;2-V", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u67ajy4ebFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
