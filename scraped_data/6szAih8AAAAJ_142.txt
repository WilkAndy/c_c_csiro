These parameters do not fully express the features of polymer MWDs, thus limiting the ability to rationally design complex polymeric materials with tailored MWDs. Herein, a platform for the design and synthesis of arbitrary polymer MWDs is developed and experimentally validated. The platform is based on the description of polymer MWDs as a mathematical function, rather than individual statistical parameters. As such, the complete shape of arbitrary polymer MWDs can be designed using developed software. The software requires only a calibration using model monomodal MWDs directly obtained from GPC to design theoretical MWD.
