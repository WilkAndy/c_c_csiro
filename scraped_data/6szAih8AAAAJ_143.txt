We have found that trichloroacetyl isocyanate (TAI) reacts rapidly and quantitatively with both carboxyl [C(O)OH] and hydroxyl (OH) chain ends to form derivatives that can be readily determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The TAI capped end-groups give rise to characteristic imidic NH resonances in a normally clear region of the 1H NMR spectrum [\u03b4\u223c10\u201311.5 for C(O)\u2013O\u2013C(O)\u2013NH\u2013C(O)CCl3 from C(O)OH, \u03b4\u223c8\u20139 for O\u2013C(O)\u2013NH\u2013C(O)CCl3 from OH]. The method has been successfully applied to quantitative determination of the end-groups of a wide variety of oligomeric polyesters. It has also been applied to higher molecular weight polyesters including commercial, bottle grade, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and PET based copolyesters (e.g. PETG)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6866003376680850394", "cites_id": ["6866003376680850394"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032386105004696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2tOxhbHxSF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 3}}
