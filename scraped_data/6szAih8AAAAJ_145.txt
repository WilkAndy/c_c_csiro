RAFT arose out of a desire to achieve perfection in polymers (or at least to define and limit the imperfections) and to invent living radical polymerization. However, living radical polymerization cannot be and never was. This perspective looks at RAFT after 21\u2009years of development. Is RAFT a mature technology? We briefly summarize areas of current interest focusing on what is happening at CSIRO and point to where RAFT is going in areas such as RAFT free from exogenous initiators (photoRAFT, PET\u2010RAFT, eRAFT), new RAFT agents, RAFT for sequence\u2010defined polymers and RAFT single unit monomer insertion, RAFT emulsion polymerization and RAFT polymerization\u2010induced self\u2010assembly (PISA), RAFT\u2010crosslinking polymerization and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Vztgr1qGG8IC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15223362767965394954", "cites_id": ["15223362767965394954"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pi.5944", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Chh818c_RNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
