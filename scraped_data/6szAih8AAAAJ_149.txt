Kinetic experiments demonstrated that HECP provided good control in RAFT polymerization of vinyl chloride (VC) with dispersity (\u0110) \u223c 1.2 for 3400 < Mn < 11000. Chain extension experiments with VC and vinyl acetate proved the high end-group fidelity of the macroRAFT agent formed. The hydroxy end-group of the PVC macroRAFT agent allowed its use as a ROP initiator in forming a series of PVC-b-PCL with different PCL block lengths by RAFT-T\u0335-ROP.
