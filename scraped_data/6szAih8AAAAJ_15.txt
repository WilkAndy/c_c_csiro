These compounds have been shown to be highly effective in RAFT polymerization of styrene and (meth)acrylate esters to produce polymers of predetermined molecular weight and narrow polydispersity (usually <1.2). By contrast, simple N,N-dialkyl dithiocarbamates (those compounds previously described as \u201cphotoiniferters\u201d) are ineffective as RAFT agents. The reasons for the different behavior are discussed.
