The values of the apparent transfer constants \\left(C_\\rmtr^\\rmapp\\right) of the benzyl aryl trithiocarbonates (0.029 m) in bulk styrene polymerization at 110\u00b0 C fall within the range 10\u201325 depending on substituents on the aryl ring (Z\u2032) and are higher than that of benzyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate 1 for which C_\\rmtr^\\rmapp was determined to be 9.4. There is a trend for higher transfer constant, lower dispersity product and better control over polymerization with more electron\u2010withdrawing substituents with the most active in the series studied being the 3, 5\u2010bis (trifluoromethyl) phenyl derivative."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1999362882730266593", "cites_id": ["1999362882730266593"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.200900557", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4Q894vIpvxsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
