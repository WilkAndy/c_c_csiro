Changes in the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were measured by GPC. For polymers prepared with benzoyl-carbonyl-13C peroxide or benzoyl-\u03b1-13C peroxide, the end groups incorporated by head addition or transfer to initiator/primary radical termination (secondary benzoate esters) undergo rapid elimination at 300\u00b0 and must be considered potential \u201cweak links\u201d. However, benzoate end groups formed by \u201ctail\u201d addition to monomer (primary benzoates) are relatively stable at 300\u00b0 and are not \u201cweak links\u201d. Phenyl end groups are also stable at 300\u00b0. Experiments with model compounds show that the unsaturated ends of the type formed by elimination of the benzoate end groups are labile at 300\u00b0.
