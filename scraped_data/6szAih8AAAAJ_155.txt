Polymerization of styrene was conducted using a poly(methyl methacrylate) benzodithioate as macroRAFT agent in both miniemulsion and bulk. The substantially higher polymerization rate in miniemulsion, which is attributed to the segregation effect (compartmentalization) causing a reduction in the rate of bimolecular termination, makes it possible to reach a given degree of polymerization in a significantly shorter time than in the corresponding bulk system. As a consequence, fewer initiating radicals are required throughout the polymerization, leading to higher livingness in the more rapid miniemulsion system. It is demonstrated how this approach facilitates synthesis of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:XAp-VaTZjjwC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14809000888174389516", "cites_id": ["14809000888174389516"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pola.29329", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DCkUqtgjhM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
