Such polymers can also be odorous or release an odor overtime due to decomposition of the thiocarbonylthio groups. The presence of Such color and odor can be disadvantageous. In some circumstances, it may also be necessary to deactivate thiocarbonylthio groups because of their reactivity or to transform them for use in Subsequent processing into conventional applications, such as coating compositions.For certain applications, it is desirable to have polymers possessing thiol functionality. These applications include the use of bis-or multithiols in the synthesis of condensation polymers such as polythiourethanes and polythioesters or polymers containing disulfide linkages. Polymeric thiols can also be used as transfer agents in free radical polymerization to form \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14854176101613450683", "cites_id": ["14854176101613450683"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US8283436B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uzXEr3aiJM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 4}}
