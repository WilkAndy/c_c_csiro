The dependence of grafting efficiency on various operating parameters (maleic anhydride level, maleic anhydride:initiator ratio, throughput rate, direction of screw rotation, temperature) has been established. Literature methods for characterization of the grafted product based on FTIR or 1H NMR analysis have been critically examined with respect to their ability to distinguish between single unit and oligomeric maleic anhydride grafts and found to yield ambiguous results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:J4E9jCG1tHUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1848720610488266002,15121647842625769508", "cites_id": ["1848720610488266002", "15121647842625769508"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.19981290110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Eq0YrZn5pxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
