The penultimate (and other) models are often not considered or are rejected as making no significant improvement. It is argued that such inferences are invalid unless reference is made to the power of the experiments in estimating penultimate unit effects. A method for assessing the possible magnitude of penultimate unit effects in binary copolymerization is offered. This involvesusing a nonlinear least-squares method to fit the penultimate model and constructing an approximate 95% joint confidence interval for rx/rx and r2/r2'. The method is illustrated with reference to literature data for methyl methacrylate/styrene copolymerization. Ananalysis of the composition data of Fukuda et al. for this system shows that while the terminal model is a possible solution, the size of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8637416508707354336", "cites_id": ["8637416508707354336"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00193a025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4LaYOo1E3ncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 4, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
