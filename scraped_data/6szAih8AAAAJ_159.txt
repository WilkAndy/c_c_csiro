Herein, syntheses of block copolymers by RAFT polymerization using trithiocarbonate RAFT species are conducted as solution, miniemulsion, and emulsion polymerizations to demonstrate that the issue of monomer order for styrene and butyl methacrylate can be largely overcome in emulsion polymerization under carefully chosen conditions. The presence of monomer droplets in emulsion polymerization\u2014in addition to polymer particles that constitute the locus of polymerization\u2014leads to a reduction in the ratio of RAFT end groups to monomer at the locus of polymerization. Consequently, fragmentation of the RAFT adduct radical in the \u201cbackward\u201d (\u201cwrong\u201d) direction is associated with fewer monomer additions, thus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:WIXB4To3Tx4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12083342647478368643", "cites_id": ["12083342647478368643"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c02415", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g7lGGh6osKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
