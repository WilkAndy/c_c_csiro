Primary concerns are the structures of the graft copolymers formed, the mechanisms of graft formation and their relationship to processing conditions. The first section addresses typical process conditions, mechanisms of free radical induced modification of polyolefins in the melt, and provides some general guidelines as to the factors important in controlling product structure. A critical review of the melt phase synthesis of polyolefins with reactive functionality follows. These materials, which may serve as precursors to other polyolefin graft copolymers, include polyolefins with grafted maleic anhydride, fumarate and maleate esters, (meth)acrylate esters [e.g. glycidyl methacrylate and hydroxethyl methacrylate] and (meth)acrylic acid.
