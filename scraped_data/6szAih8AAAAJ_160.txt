Herein we apply cyclic voltammetry to establish a predominant reduction mechanism, where electrochemical reduction is coupled to an irreversible first-order chemical reaction. Structure-dependent trends in cyclic voltammograms (CVs), and comparison to absorption spectra, clarify the role of R- and Z-groups in determining reduction processes. The major reduction peak moves to more cathodic potentials in the series dithiobenzoates > trithiocarbonates > heteroaromatic dithiocarbamates > xanthates \u223c N-alkyl-N-aryldithiocarbamates, due to the Z-group influence on thiocarbonyl bond reactivity.
