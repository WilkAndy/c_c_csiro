The main factors responsible for the preeminent position of radical polymerization are as follows (a) it can be used with a large variety of monomers;(b) it is tolerant of a wide range of functional groups and reaction conditions;(c) it is simple to implement and inexpensive in relation to competitive technologies. However, the conventional process has some notable limitations with respect to the degree of control over the molecular weight distribution, polymer composition and architecture. The recent emergence of techniques for implementing living radical polymerization has provided a new set of tools that allow very precise control over the polymerization process while retaining much of the versatility of conventional radical polymerization [2\u20135].
