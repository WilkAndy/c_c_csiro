An amphiphilic RAFT agent [RSC(\u2550S)Z], based on a hydrophilic methacrylic R-group [C\u0307(CH3)2CO2-PEG] and a hydrophobic Z group with Ctr \u2248 2, was used to mediate the polymerization of a range of methacrylate monomers under both heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions. Consistent with the low Ctr, batch miniemulsion or solution polymerizations did not provide polymers with low \u0110. The issue of a low Ctr is overcome in an emulsion polymerization when the [monomer]/[RAFT agent] ratio at the locus of polymerization is substantially lower than the overall ratio, due to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1933534738525268009", "cites_id": ["1933534738525268009"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c01311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KSitsplL1RoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 15, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
