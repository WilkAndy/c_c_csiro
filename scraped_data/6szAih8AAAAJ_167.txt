The various factors (temperature, concentrations, type of cobaloxime, types of monomer) that influence molecular weight and end group purity and the importance of the various side reactions that may complicate the process are described. Macromonomer purity is enhanced by increasing the concentration of the \u03b1-methylvinyl monomer and reducing the cobaloxime concentration. It also depends on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4766341887400764229", "cites_id": ["4766341887400764229"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0501949", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RWOWhLFyJUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
