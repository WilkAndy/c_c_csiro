Polymers of loW molecule Weight, or oligomers, are important as precursors in producing other polymeric materials and such polymers have been found to be useful in a variety of products, for example, in the production of high solids (loW VOC) surface coatings, in adhesives and as plasticiZers in polymeric composites. In conventional polymeriZation practice, the manufac ture of oligomers requires the use of an initiator Which acts as a free radical source, and of a chain transfer agent. The chain transfer agent controls the molecular Weight of the polymer by reacting With the propagating polymer radical to terminate its groWth. It then initiates a neW polymer chain thus transferring the groWth process from one discrete polymer molecule to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17407637597854288350,7728950673620418406,16008559492958087225", "cites_id": ["17407637597854288350", "7728950673620418406", "16008559492958087225"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US5773543A/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3snWZipalPEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 7, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
