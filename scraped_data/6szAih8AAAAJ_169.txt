The formation of poly(methacrylate) copolymers with pendent reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent functionalities was performed using a selective photoactivation approach in the first step, specifically via green light-mediated direct photoRAFT polymerization. A nonselective photoinduced chain extension using red light-triggered photoinduced energy/electron transfer (PET)-RAFT polymerization was then performed to provide tailored graft copolymers. Notably, the application of this protocol to a flow process with two spatially segregated unit operations provides a route to independent control of the backbone-forming step (unit operation one) and the subsequent chain extensions (unit operation two).
