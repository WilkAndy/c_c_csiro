Its success relies on a rapid, easily scalable and straightforward process, associated with the ability to readily control nanoparticle morphology. In the present work, we have investigated the effect of the Z-group of RAFT agents ZC(S)\u2013SR on the nucleation step of aqueous RAFT PISA performed in environmentally friendly emulsion polymerization. Seven different poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) macroRAFTs were synthesized using RAFT agents containing Z-groups of different hydrophilicity. Slow polymerizations and incomplete chain extension reactions were observed for systems with the most hydrophilic Z-group, while the more hydrophobic Z groups led to higher polymerization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:a2necdfpwlEC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9001973961679267602,16400183346668294967", "cites_id": ["9001973961679267602", "16400183346668294967"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/py/d0py01311k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Emc1p59v7XwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
