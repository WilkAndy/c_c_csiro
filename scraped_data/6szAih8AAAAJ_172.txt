N-(4-pyridinyl)-N-methyldithiocarbamates provide excellent control over polymerization of less activated monomers (LAMs) (e.g., vinyl acetate, N-vinylcarbazole), and, after addition of one equivalent of a protic or Lewis acid, become effective in controlling polymerization of more activated monomers (MAMs) (e.g., styrene, methyl methacrylate). They thus allow a convenient synthesis of polyMAM-block-polyLAM with narrow molecular weight distributions. Advantages, limitations and factors effecting the scope of the process are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15782290421791732700", "cites_id": ["15782290421791732700"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2011-1066.ch007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3DPyPIX1BdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 7}}
