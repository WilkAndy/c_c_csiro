The primary objective of this research was to find dispersants that (a) allow PP nanocomposites to be formed by direct melt mixing; (b) are effective with unmodified clays and (c) comprise of only a minor component with respect to both the clay and the overall composition. Linear, branched, gemini and sugar\u2010based surfactants and structures containing poly(dimethyl siloxane) and poly(methyl methacrylate) blocks were examined. These additives were found to be effective in breaking down the clay agglomerates to tactoids, giving some expansion of the clay structure and partial exfoliation and providing substantially improved clay dispersion.
