Thus, under irradiation with red (633 nm) or yellow (593 nm) light with 50 mpm (moles per million mole of monomer) ZnTPPS at 30 \u00b0C, the rate enhancement provided by photoinduced energy or electron transfer (PET) is \u2248sevenfold over the rate of direct photoRAFT\u2010SUMI (without catalyst), which corresponds to achieving full and selective reaction in hours versus days. Importantly, the selectivity, as judged by the absence of oligomers, is retained. Under green light at similar power, higher rates of SUMI are also observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2790505430787270859", "cites_id": ["2790505430787270859"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.201900478", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y6jfkefduSYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
