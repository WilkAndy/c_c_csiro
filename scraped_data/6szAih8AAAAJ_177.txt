The process includes contacting the starting polymer containing groups Y, with one or more reagents containing groups X to produce the derived polymer and a byproduct containing the groups Y, wherein the groups X is one or more reactive groups and the groups Y, is an extracting group and a byproduct, which is then separated from the derived polymer by conventional separation processes. The derived polymer is free from odor or color that is sometimes associated with the starting poly merand it can be used in making optical lenses, such as high refractive index spectacle lenses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8811956401900849359", "cites_id": ["8811956401900849359"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US8569441B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z4iH56hbSnoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
