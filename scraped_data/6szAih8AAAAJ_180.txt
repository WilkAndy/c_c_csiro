Benzoyloxy radicals do give head addition, but only to a small extent relative to tail addition (ratio 5\u223666). With both initiators hydrogen abstraction from monomer is only a minor process (\u2a7d1%). These results were obtained by analysis of the products formed when radicals are trapped by nitroxides."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2206874877698576646", "cites_id": ["2206874877698576646"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00255168", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BhH1PAJloB4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 4, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
