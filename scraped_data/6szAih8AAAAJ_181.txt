The introduction of either 0.5 or 1 mol equiv of Sc(OTf)3, with respect to RAFT agent, into a RAFT copolymerization of MA and VAc provides substantially improved control resulting in significantly reduced molar mass dispersities (\u0110) (\u223c1.1\u20131.3) than achieved in its absence (\u0110 \u223c 1.3\u20131.4). Furthermore, similar introduction of Sc(OTf)3 into MA homopolymerization mediated by the same RAFT agent also delivered polymers of very low \u0110 (\u223c1.15). Sc(OTf)3 was also found to lower the rate of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:xGWFX6Gbr9MC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14382079452828570095", "cites_id": ["14382079452828570095"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.7b02104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:75FKFRBpl8cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
