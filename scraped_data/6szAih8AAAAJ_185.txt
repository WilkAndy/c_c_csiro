It has the merit that kp values can be determined independently of termination rate coefficients (kt). The PLPMWD method has been used successfully to obtain kp values for the homopolymerizations of a wide range of monomers including styrene, 2-4 acrylate esters, 5 methacrylate esters6, 7 and methacrylonitrile. 8 Several theoretical and modeling studies of the PLP-MWD technique have also been undertaken. 1, 3, 4, 6, 9-11 These show that, with appropriate choice of reaction conditions and methods for data analysis, the PLP-MWD method is robust and provides accurate and reliable kp data. Computer simulations1, 3, 4, 6, 9-11 also show that the shape of the MWD is largely controlled by the radical flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11168589046910091419", "cites_id": ["11168589046910091419"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ma9708095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mwBlf5DM_poJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2}}
