The method involves comparing experimental molecular weight distributions of polymers formed in pulsed laser photolysis experiments with those predicted by kinetic simulation. The method is enabled by direct measurements of the concentration of radicals generated per laser pulse. Knowledge of the radical concentrations should mean that the only unknowns in the simulations are the termination rate coefficients. The analysis demonstrates the need for chain length dependent termination rate constants in describing polymerization kinetics. Polymerization kinetics were analyzed in terms of two models which purport to describe the functional form of kt(i,j).
