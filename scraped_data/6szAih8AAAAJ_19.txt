RAFT agents (1) function effectively only when the substituent on sulfur (R) is a good homolytic leaving group when compared to the polymer chain Pn. 3 With appropriate choice of the RAFT agent (1), a wide range of polymers of predetermined molecular weight and narrow polydispersity can be prepared. 1, 2, 4-8 The versatility and convenience of this process offer distinct advantages over other forms of living radical polymerization. 9-12Our previous work has shown that trithiocarbonates are effective RAFT agents. 1, 6 The outstanding feature of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 643, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8664502029632099016,3406372790640348576,16061423793175544262", "cites_id": ["8664502029632099016", "3406372790640348576", "16061423793175544262"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ma991451a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yFLff7B-PngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 21, "2002": 33, "2003": 34, "2004": 23, "2005": 35, "2006": 52, "2007": 50, "2008": 50, "2009": 43, "2010": 32, "2011": 39, "2012": 28, "2013": 31, "2014": 28, "2015": 25, "2016": 12, "2017": 18, "2018": 17, "2019": 22, "2020": 11, "2021": 17, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
