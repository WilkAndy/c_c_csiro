Factors known to influence radical--radical reactions involving low molecular weight species are described. Termination of homopolymerization of styrene, methacrylate, acrylate, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride polymers is addressed. A brief section is devoted to termination of copolymerization. Advantages and limitations of techniques used to characterize termination are summarized. 107 ref.--D.M.Y."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14141884357042405260", "cites_id": ["14141884357042405260"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14141884357042405260&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jH8qVOUQQsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
