RAFT (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer)-crosslinking polymerisation of styrene and divinylbenzene provided monoliths which were then functionalized by RAFT \u201cgrafting from\u201d polymerisation of 4-styryldiphenylphosphine mediated by the retained thiocarbonylthio functionality. Under the chosen conditions, the retention of the RAFT functionality was proved by chain extension experiments in which the monoliths were five times re-subjected to the grafting conditions. Importantly, the bound triphenylphosphine-functionality was demonstrated to be catalytically active when the monoliths were used as flow reactors in performing Michael addition of 1-hexanethiol to tert-butyl acrylate and of acetyl acetone to diethyl azodicarboxylate.
