It is a reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) 1 and arguably the most versatile method for providing living characteristics to radical polymerization. 2-10 The historical development of RAFT polymerization at CSIRO has been outlined. 3, 5 RAFT polymerization provides the ability to control polymerization of most monomers polymerizable by radical polymerization. These include (meth) acrylates,(meth) acrylamides, acrylonitrile, styrenes, dienes and vinyl monomers. It is tolerant of unprotected functionality in monomer and solvent (eg OH, NR2, COOH, CONR2, SO3H). The process is compatible with a wide rage of reaction conditions (eg bulk, organic or aqueous solution, emulsion, miniemulsion, suspension). It is simple to implement and inexpensive in relation to competitive RDRP.A mechanism for RAFT process is shown in Scheme 1. In an ideal living polymerization, all chains are initiated at the beginning of the process, grow at a similar rate and survive the polymerization (there is no irreversible chain transfer or termination). If initiation is rapid with respect to propagation the molecular weight distribution is very narrow and chains can be extended by the provision of further monomer. In a radical polymerization all chains cannot be simultaneously active. In RAFT polymerization, the majority of living chains are maintained in a dormant form. A rapid equilibrium between active (propagating radicals) and dormant chains (macroRAFT agents) ensures that all chains grow at a similar rate. Under these conditions, molecular weights can increase linearly with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=393317909875895607", "cites_id": ["393317909875895607"], "pub_url": "https://www.strem.com/resource/1/124/the_strem_chemiker-vol_xxv_no_1_march_2011#page=4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N63zHY5YdQUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
