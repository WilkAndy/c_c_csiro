The library of statistical copolymers of varied molar mass was synthesized by reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The synthesized polymers comprise pendent hydroxyl and sulfonated side chains as well as the reverse transcriptase prodrug lamivudine (3TC) attached via a disulfide self-immolative linker. The glutathione mediated release of 3TC is demonstrated as well as the antiviral efficacy against HIV entry and polymerase activity. Although a high degree of polymer sulfonation is required for effective HIV entry inhibition, polymers with approximately \u223c50% sulfonated monomer demonstrated potent kinase independent reverse transcriptase inhibition. In addition, the sulfonated polymers demonstrate activity against DNA\u2013DNA polymerase, which suggests that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5345159895759215946", "cites_id": ["5345159895759215946"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00156", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Sl1k9prSLUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
