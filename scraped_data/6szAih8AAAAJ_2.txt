Since we first introduced the technique in 1998, the number of papers and patents on the RAFT process has increased exponentially as the technique has proved to be one of the most versatile for the provision of polymers of well defined architecture. The factors influencing the effectiveness of RAFT agents and outcome of RAFT polymerization are detailed. With this insight, guidelines are presented on how to conduct RAFT and choose RAFT agents to achieve particular structures. A survey is provided of the current scope and applications of the RAFT process in the synthesis of well defined homo-, gradient, diblock, triblock, and star polymers, as well as more complex architectures including microgels and polymer brushes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ymY9cBF3mdcC", "num_citations": 2682, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1996560858022451674,11167607257854682848", "cites_id": ["1996560858022451674", "11167607257854682848"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH05072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2pngqoU1tRsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 14, "2006": 117, "2007": 181, "2008": 199, "2009": 173, "2010": 168, "2011": 171, "2012": 199, "2013": 200, "2014": 178, "2015": 196, "2016": 168, "2017": 124, "2018": 137, "2019": 106, "2020": 113, "2021": 105, "2022": 86, "2023": 32}}
