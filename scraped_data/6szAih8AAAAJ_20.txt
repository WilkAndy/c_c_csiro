In recent technical literature, these reactions have often been loosely referred to as, inter alia, \"controlled\", \"controlled/living\", or \"living\" polymerizations. The use of these terms is discouraged. The use of \"controlled\" is permitted as long as the type of control is defined at its first occurrence, but the full name that is recommended for these polymerizations is \"reversible-deactivation radical polymerization\"."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 612, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12223983186332960539,7717042165418225090", "cites_id": ["12223983186332960539", "7717042165418225090"], "pub_url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1351/PAC-REP-08-04-03/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G0e5SfFPpKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 35, "2012": 52, "2013": 42, "2014": 63, "2015": 61, "2016": 50, "2017": 52, "2018": 48, "2019": 50, "2020": 56, "2021": 45, "2022": 28, "2023": 9}}
