Macro\u2010RAFT agents from more activated monomers (MAMs) (i.e., styrene (St), N\u2010isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm), and methyl methacrylate (MMA)) with R\uf8ffS2CZH+ and less activated monomers (LAMs) (i.e., vinyl acetate (VAc) and N\u2010vinylpyrolidone (NVP)) with R\uf8ffS2CZ are prepared by RAFT polymerization and analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. In all cases, a mass loss consistent with loss of the end group (Z\uf8ffCS2H) is observed at temperatures lower than, and largely discrete from, that required for further degradation of the polymer. The temperatures for end group loss and the new end groups formed are strongly dependent on the identity of the R\uf8ff(P)n and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15018016016934939355,14387955267806902002", "cites_id": ["15018016016934939355", "14387955267806902002"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.201800228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:26qIoP-1atAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
