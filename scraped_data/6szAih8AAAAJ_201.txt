This one-stop resource offers readers a detailed synopsis of the current state of RAFT polymerization. This text will inspire further research and continue the drive to an ever-increasing range of applications by synthesizing and explaining the more central existing literature on RAFT polymerization. It contains a beginner\u2019s guide on how to do a RAFT polymerization before moving on to much more advanced techniques and concepts, like the kinetics and mechanisms of the RAFT process. The distinguished editors have also included resources covering the four major classes of RAFT agents and recent developments in processes for initiating RAFT polymerization. Readers will also benefit from the inclusion of: A thorough introduction to the mechanisms, theory, and mathematical modeling of RAFT Explorations of RAFT agent design and synthesis, dithioesters, dithiobenzoates, trithiocarbonates, xanthates, dithiocarbamates, macromonomer RAFT, and RAFT copolymerization Discussions of a variety of RAFT architectures, including multiblocks, combs, hyperbranched polymers, and stars Treatments of end group transformation, cationic RAFT, high-throughput RAFT, and RAFT in continuous flow An examination of sequence defined polymers by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:I9gX6wnfuA8C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9743318478856489921", "cites_id": ["9743318478856489921"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=GC5LEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=info:wYu9wYg4N4cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=G_oHbtqiDQ&sig=F35avJOFkQ30eFyUUjH1DlYEEGs", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wYu9wYg4N4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
