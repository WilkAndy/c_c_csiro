Following a brief review of RAFT-single unit monomer insertion (RAFT-SUMI), we describe recent developments in the field. We point to difficulties in achieving consecutive RAFT-SUMI and report two strategies for overcoming the issue of initiator-derived by-products. We show that the selection of RAFT agent is critical in selective RAFT-SUMI of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAm) into a trithiocarbonate in aqueous solution. Finally we recount on the use of photoRAFT- or PET-RAFT-SUMI in the high yield synthesis of discrete oligomers comprising two or more consecutive SUMI steps."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:0sTkTiv_uMkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1864987090038267781", "cites_id": ["1864987090038267781"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2018-1284.ch004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hZ9rlODD4RkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
