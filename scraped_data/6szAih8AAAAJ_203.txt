The star polymers were cleaved to the linear arms with tributylphosphine as a reducing agent. The decrease in molecular weight observed is consistent with the initial stars having approximately five arms. Blue fluorescence was observed when a solution of mikto-arm star was irradiated under a 365 nm light proving the retention of the SN-38 moiety during star formation by RAFT polymerization. Thus these polymer-drug conjugates can be considered as potential delivery vehicles for cancer therapy. The P(DMAEMA) arms can be quaternized using iodomethane, allowing star polymers to bind negatively charged small interfering \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15156188782233995546", "cites_id": ["15156188782233995546"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11426-014-5128-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GknRgWWZVdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
