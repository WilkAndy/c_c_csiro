A key finding is that the reactive extrusion process, presumably as a consequence of branching and branch distribution, significantly modifies the crystallisation kinetics and changes the final morphology. Using small\u2010angle X\u2010ray scattering (SAXS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the crystallisation kinetics of PET was monitored from the melt (270 \u00b0C) to a crystallisation temperature of either 205 or 210 \u00b0C. The IV of the branched PET was \u223c 21% greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1071401148365328999", "cites_id": ["1071401148365328999"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pi.2097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z9JC_Kph3g4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
