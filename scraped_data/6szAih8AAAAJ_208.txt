The use of a mediator can limit side reactions that would otherwise inhibit polymerization. In this work, we present the use of anthraquinone (AQ) to mediate the electrochemical reduction of a trithiocarbonate RAFT agent, 4-cyano-4-(((dodecylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)pentanoic acid, and thereby initiate RAFT polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). In a representative eRAFT reaction conducted in DMSO with a target degree of polymerization (DP) of 100, conversion reached 67% in 24 h at ambient temperature, with \u0110 = 1.19. The effect of reaction conditions on polymerization was studied\u2014in general, the conversion rate was found to decrease as target DP increases.
