The process involves the synthesis of AB2 3-mikto-arm stars, star-[PVC-block-(polyB);(polyB)2] or star-[PVC;(polyB)2], that contain a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-synthesized PVC segment, to provide compatibility with PVC and good migration resistance, and multiple RAFT-synthesized segments (polyB), where polyB is based on more activated monomer (a styrene or a methacrylate) that contains the functionality required to impart the desired additive properties. The approach to PVC-based stars comprises three steps: (a) synthesis of a hydroxy-functional PVC [X-PVC(OH)n] by RAFT polymerization mediated by a hydroxy-functional xanthate [X-(OH)n], (b) conversion of the X-PVC(OH)n to the corresponding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:9LpHyFPp1DQC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16268544311216062763", "cites_id": ["16268544311216062763"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c00125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K0G8Stt6xeEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
