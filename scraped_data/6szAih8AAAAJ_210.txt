Self-immolative prodrug monomers were explored and compared from which a prefered route with greatest overall yield was determined. 1H-NMR studies demonstrated that triggered, simultaneous drug release from copolymers was achieved when incubated with glutathione (GSH). HIV replication assays revealed that potency increased with polymer molar mass. Copolymers with both AZT and 3TC pendents exhibited potencies close to the potency of unconjugated AZT alone indicating that potency cannot be explained by additive effects. Treatment of this potency data with a Chou and Talalay combination model revealed combination indices \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:9DLIHnF0jcYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3157860732856431056", "cites_id": ["3157860732856431056"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/py/c6py01882c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0PEPAJv50isJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
