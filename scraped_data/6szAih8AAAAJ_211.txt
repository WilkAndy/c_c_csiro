These processes are also often called living radical polymerizations or controlled radical polymerizations. However, the use of these terms in this context is now discouraged. 1In an ideal living polymerization, all chains are initiated, grow at the same rate and survive polymerization; there is no termination or other side reactions. In radical polymerization, all chains cannot be simultaneously active because of the propensity of the propagating radicals to undergo self-reaction or reaction with other radicals by combination or disproportionation. In RDRP living characteristics are provided through reagents that react with the propagating radicals (Pn) by maintain the majority reversible coupling or reversible chain transfer of living chains in a dormant form (Pn-X). 2 so as to"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17957126100343600508", "cites_id": ["17957126100343600508"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pHMoDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA205&dq=info:fDXgHQyHNPkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=SEoC50pHQw&sig=CTFS7EqxWjVp3sy5c5wohhy0Ncg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fDXgHQyHNPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
