A particular focus of the meeting was radical polymerization with RAFT (Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer). The meeting also celebrated the 65th birthday and record of scientific achievement of Ezio Rizzardo (CSIRO Molecular and Health Technologies), a pioneer of reversible deactivation radical polymerization and one of the inventors of the RAFT process.Following welcoming remarks by Greg Simpson (deputy chief, CSIRO Molecular and Health Technologies), the conference commenced with a plenary lecture by Rizzardo on \u201cPerspectives of RAFT Polymerization\u2014Something Old and Something New,\u201d in which he announced a new class of \u201cswitchable\u201d RAFT agents. Four speakers then provided an industrial perspective on the applications of RAFT polymerization: Mike Fryd (DuPont) talked about \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:tHtfpZlB6tUC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5535422761054087670", "cites_id": ["5535422761054087670"], "pub_url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ci.2009.31.5.26/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9qk9WqzF0UwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
