RAFT polymerization enables the preparation of polymers with predictable molar mass, narrow chain length distribution, high end-group integrity and provides the ability to construct macromolecules with the intricate architectures and composition demanded by modern applications in medicine, electronics and nanotechnology. This paper provides a background to understanding the mechanism of RAFT polymerization and how this technique has evolved."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:8RAEygVn5_EC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4884910106355439469", "cites_id": ["4884910106355439469"], "pub_url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cti-2020-0026/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bRcIQdyvykMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
