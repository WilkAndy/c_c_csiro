In benzene, ethyl acrylate reacts with isobutylene or 2,3-dimethylbut- 2-ene to afford the terminally unsaturated products (5) and (9) respectively. In 1,2-dichloroethane-nitromethane the initial products undergo isomerization or rearrangement. Un-ambiguous routes to 2,2- dimethylcyclobutanecarboxylic acid (19) and (2,2,3,3- tetramethylcyclobutyl)- methanol (26) are described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17769212715396553498", "cites_id": ["17769212715396553498"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH9772733", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GtuQv9HsmPYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
