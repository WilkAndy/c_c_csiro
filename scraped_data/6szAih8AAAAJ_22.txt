Heating a bis(thiocarbonyl) disulfide with an azo-compound results in the formation of (thiocarbonyl)sulfanyl derivatives in moderate to high yield. The process is proposed as the method of choice for preparing tertiary (thiocarbonyl)sulfanyl compounds and is compatible with a wide range of functionalities (e.g. carboxy, hydroxy and nitrile)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 538, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7779441829025237804", "cites_id": ["7779441829025237804"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004040399900177X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LEvdUSAh9msJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 7, "2001": 4, "2002": 9, "2003": 15, "2004": 14, "2005": 23, "2006": 38, "2007": 40, "2008": 36, "2009": 27, "2010": 31, "2011": 35, "2012": 36, "2013": 23, "2014": 41, "2015": 26, "2016": 35, "2017": 17, "2018": 18, "2019": 18, "2020": 12, "2021": 17, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
