Reactive extrusion of bottle-grade PET with the branching and chain-extension agents pyromellitic dianhydride and pentaerythritol results in enhanced rheological properties, such as higher melt strength and higher viscosity. In this study, six samples of PET were investigated: linear PET [intrinsic viscosity (IV) \u2243 0.76\u2005dm3\u2005g\u22121]; four branched PETs produced from linear PET by a reactive extrusion technique (IV \u2243 0.86\u20131.06\u2005dm3\u2005g\u22121); and a control PET (IV \u2243 0.73\u2005dm3\u2005g\u22121) extruded under the same conditions without reactive agents. SAXS data were recorded for the PET at the melt temperature and time-resolved SAXS data were recorded following the application of a step shear (53\u2005s\u22121 for 2\u2005s).
