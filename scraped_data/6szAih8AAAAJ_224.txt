Thus RAFT emulsion polymerization of styrene in the presence of the protonated RAFT agent, ((((cyanomethyl)thio)carbonothioyl)(methyl)amino)pyridin-1-ium toluenesulfonate (4), and the analogous methyl-quaternized RAFT agents, 4-((((cyanomethyl)thio)carbonothioyl)(methyl)amino)-1-methylpyridin-1-ium dodecyl sulfate (6), provide low dispersity polystyrene with \u0110m 1.2\u20131.4 for Mn \u223c 20\u2006000. We postulate that the success of ab initio emulsion polymerization with 4 is due to the hydrophilicity of the pyridinium group, which is such that the water soluble RAFT agent partitions predominantly into the aqueous phase under the conditions of the experiment and that 4 provides little retardation. With 6, when the counterion is dodecyl sulfate, we can achieve \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:w2UhwfzvF0QC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16239008601328281921,3363147871924442422", "cites_id": ["16239008601328281921", "3363147871924442422"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/py/c9py00893d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QWmv8kiMXOEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
