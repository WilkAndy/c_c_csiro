We cover the origins of the method, which lie with the development of the so\u2010called macromonomer RAFT agents. Macromonomer RAFT polymerization, also now known as sulphur\u2010free RAFT polymerization, drew significant interest from the industry, particularly with commercial development of low VOC coatings and effective dispersants for pigments and dyes. However, the term RAFT agent can usually be understood to refer to thiocarbonylthio RAFT agents, which are most often dithioesters, trithiocarbonates, xanthates, or dithiocarbamates. Patents on thiocarbonylthio RAFT polymerization continue to increase. There are currently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:eAUscmXIlQ8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14993873203529097465", "cites_id": ["14993873203529097465"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527821358.ch24", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-aCZ1zzwFNAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
