The polymerization rate, and hence the concentration of polymer radical P\u2022, was proportional to [BPO]1/2. The pseudo-first-order activation rate constants kact were determined by the GPC peak-resolution and the polydispersity-analysis methods. The results showed that kact is directly proportional to [P\u2022], indicating that reversible addition\u2212fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) is the only important mechanism of activation. The magnitude of the exchange rate constant kex (= kact/[P\u2022]) was strongly dependent on both the structures of the dithiocarbonate group and the polymer. The kex values for the three RAFT systems examined in this work were all very large, which explains why these systems can provide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 441, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14767028383802629058", "cites_id": ["14767028383802629058"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0009451", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wpuqdBMG78wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 8, "2002": 29, "2003": 39, "2004": 22, "2005": 42, "2006": 36, "2007": 28, "2008": 42, "2009": 25, "2010": 18, "2011": 15, "2012": 20, "2013": 19, "2014": 18, "2015": 15, "2016": 17, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
