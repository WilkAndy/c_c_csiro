Thus, by integration of the spectra, it is possible to estimate the relative reactivity of benzoyloxy radicals towards styrene and methyl methacrylate. In addition, information on the amount of initiator consumed in other processes such as transfer to initiator and primary radical termination can be obtained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5598737112512306121", "cites_id": ["5598737112512306121"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00255436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yZsXjr21sk0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
