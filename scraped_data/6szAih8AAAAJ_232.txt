Non\u2010symmetric trithiocarbonates, where only R is a good homolytic leaving group, are currently the most popular agents used in implementing both thermally and photochemically initiated RAFT polymerization. With appropriate selection of R and/or R\u2032, good control (i.e. low dispersity, predicted                                                   M  n                                                  , high end\u2010group fidelity) can be achieved in RAFT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:vD2iS2Kej30C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10965467839967181293", "cites_id": ["10965467839967181293"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527821358.ch9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7bk2JecqLZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
