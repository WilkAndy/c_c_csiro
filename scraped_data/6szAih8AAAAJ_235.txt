The imposed constraints on chain mobility as well as chemical incompatibility between the blocks result in microphase separation, leading to formation of an onion\u2010like multilayered particle morphology with individual layer thicknesses of approximately 20\u2005nm. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers as well as the number of layers can be tailored as desired, offering more complex particle design compared to approaches relying on self\u2010assembly of preformed diblock copolymers within particles. Microphase separation can occur in these systems under conditions where \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:zdX0sdgBH_kC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9480817156397878386", "cites_id": ["9480817156397878386"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202108159", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ckyG4_igkoMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
