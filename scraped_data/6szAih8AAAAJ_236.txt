The Tg of star-PVC reduces with molar mass and with the number of arms. The star-PVC have substantially lower glass-transition temperatures (Tg) than that of linear PVC of similar Mn, with the Tg of low-molar mass 4-star-PVC being \u22127.4 \u00b0C. The star-PVC are effective in lowering the Tg of blends with commercial PVC when added at 10\u201330 wt % PVC. When added even at 10 wt %, they are effective in improving the ductility of PVC with an elongation at break (EB) of \u223c350% (4-star-PVC) and \u223c300% (3-star-PVC) relative to commercial PVC, which is substantially higher than that for PVC conventionally plasticized with 30 wt % dioctyl phthalate under similar conditions (EB \u223c160%). Importantly, the star-PVC, despite their low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:pRWBApOjXDcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11336031396573896787", "cites_id": ["11336031396573896787"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00616", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U2B2i36sUZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
