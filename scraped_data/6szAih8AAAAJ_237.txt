Two separate parameters have been explored in detail: (i) the ratio of monomer concentration to the RAFT end group concentration within particles and (ii) the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the particles. The parameters (i) and (ii) are interrelated as an increase in the ratio [monomer]:[RAFT] leads to a lower Tg because of the increased plasticization of the polymer particle by the monomer. Three different monomers were employed, each giving a polymer of different Tg values: n-butyl methacrylate (Tg = 20 \u00b0C), iso-butyl methacrylate (Tg = 57 \u00b0C), and tert-butyl methacrylate (Tg = 118 \u00b0C). The results show that the level of control over the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:AFXcoJnoRH0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9457985821047660529", "cites_id": ["9457985821047660529"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c00345", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8R86Yv6DQYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
