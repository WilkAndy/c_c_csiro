Half-lives for a range of alkoxyamines based on initiator-derived radicals or low molecular weight propagating species have been measured experimentally. The values show a marked dependence on the structure of both the nitroxide and radical components. In this work, we demonstrate that semiempirical molecular orbital calculations provide a reliable, though qualitative, prediction of the experimentally observed trends in alkoxyamine homolysis rates. For example, for a series of alkoxyamines based on nitroxides (RlCHshChNO*, C\u20140 bond dissociation energies are predicted todecrease with an increase in ring size or the CNC angle (ie, 5-membered> \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 430, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13547318361331559310,783720612762202278", "cites_id": ["13547318361331559310", "783720612762202278"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00130a003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jmtL2kW-AbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 11, "1997": 20, "1998": 27, "1999": 17, "2000": 22, "2001": 19, "2002": 26, "2003": 22, "2004": 26, "2005": 14, "2006": 20, "2007": 10, "2008": 12, "2009": 6, "2010": 13, "2011": 7, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 18, "2015": 18, "2016": 14, "2017": 13, "2018": 12, "2019": 16, "2020": 23, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
