The time/conversion dependence of the polydispersity (R) has been evaluated as a function of the relative magnitude of the rate constants associated with the initiation/termination equilibria . It is shown that the short term behaviour of R and the rate of approach to the value (R = 4/3) predicted by the steady state treatment have a marked dependence on the choice of rate constants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2073151913524280287", "cites_id": ["2073151913524280287"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH9861943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3zsJa65QxRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
