The scope of multiblock copolymer synthesis via RAFT polymerization has recently been expanded by application of the nanoreactor concept for emulsion polymerization. This enabled use of slow propagating monomers, such as styrenes and methacrylates, in multiblock synthesis. However, severe limitations attributed to the high polymer glass transition temperature (Tg) of some polymers have hitherto remained. The use of monomers that give such high-Tg polymers effectively prevented penetration of aqueous-phase-generated radicals into the polymer particles wherein the RAFT functionality is located. We here demonstrate that these constraints can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:vjZqxyZ7hS4C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8962431742723264254", "cites_id": ["8962431742723264254"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c00181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_o60XC_0YHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
