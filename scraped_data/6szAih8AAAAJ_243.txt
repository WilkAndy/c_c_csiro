Aromatic dithioesters (Z = aryl), specifically, dithiobenzoates, were reported in the initial publications on RAFT polymerization and remain amongst the more popular RAFT agents. This is attributed to the better control offered by dithiobenzoates, with respect to most other RAFT agents, over molecular weight distribution and end\u2010group fidelity over the polymerization of 1,1\u2010disubstituted monomers. Aromatic dithioesters are less suited for mediating RAFT polymerization of monosubstituted monomers where their use can be associated with significant retardation, side reactions, and other factors that limit control. Aliphatic dithioesters (Z = alkyl or substituted alkyl) were also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:XtJa11BXPS4C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6052957051605738056", "cites_id": ["6052957051605738056"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527821358.ch8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SOKnVV5sAFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
