For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side\u2010reactions and high spatio\u2010temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low\u2010energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C\u2212S bond is induced upon low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:LWqeokA2EBkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2318058419782007800,7690059412253665953", "cites_id": ["2318058419782007800", "7690059412253665953"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.202107480", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-Lu159llKyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
