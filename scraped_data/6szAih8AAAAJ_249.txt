With appropriate selection of Z\u2032 and Z\u2033, good control (i.e. low molar mass dispersity, predicted M                                                   n                                                  , and high end group fidelity) can be achieved in RAFT polymerization of most monomers, including both more\u2010activated monomers (MAMs; styrenes, acrylates, and acrylamides) and less\u2010activated monomers (LAMs; vinyl esters and vinyl amides).
