The technique requires the use of a chain transfer agent (i.e. a RAFT agent) that reacts via a reversible addition\u2013fragmentation mechanism, giving rise to a polymer that itself is a chain transfer agent. In this chapter, the mechanism of RAFT polymerization is described in detail, including how the structure of the RAFT agent affects both its suitability for a particular monomer and the associated kinetics of the polymerization. Various mechanistic explanations for the kinetic effects are presented. Additionally, potential side reactions are considered, including the side fragmentation of xanthates and hydrolysis of dithioesters.
