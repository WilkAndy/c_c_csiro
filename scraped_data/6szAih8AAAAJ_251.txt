Critical factors in the synthesis include processing conditions (temperature), end groups and catalysts used in oligoester synthesis. It is necessary to achieve a balance between ease of incorporation/synthesis and transesterification resistance. The process is discussed with reference to poly(neopentyl isophthalate) as a representative transesterification resistant oligoester. The primary motivation for the work has been the development of higher barrier poly(ethylene terephthalate) useful for making monolayer beverage containers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12894377538670028927", "cites_id": ["12894377538670028927"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.200351204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f-gz2A0I8rIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
