The two coating systems are based on the same acrylate copolymer. Samples were photolyzed in a QUV accelerated weathering tester equipped with FS-340 UV-A fluorescent bulbs. The tester was operated in the \u201clight only\u201d exposure mode at an air temperature of 40\u00b0C and a dew point of 25\u00b0C. Spectra reveal the formation of HALS based amino ether derivatives and hydroxylamine. No evidence for the accumulation of HALS decomposition products or non-reactive HALS products was found. Direct evidence that, the amino ether derivatives formed in the two coatings system are distinctly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=355074684002228562", "cites_id": ["355074684002228562"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391000000926", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UtmvOIt67QQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
