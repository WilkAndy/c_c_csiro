The end-group and overall structure of the copolymers have been examined using 1H- and 13C-NMR. It has been established that when EASC is present both the 1-methyl-1-(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl and 1-cyano-1-methylethyl radicals prefer to add S over MMA by a factor of approx. 20. In contrast, in the absence of EASC the reactivity ratio, kMMA/ks, for these radicals is 0.70 and 0.56, respectively. The change in selectivity is attributed to complex formation between the initiating radicals and EASC. Copolymers prepared with AIBN were alternating even with MMA in excess over the Lewis acid by a factor of \u223c47. When AIBMe was used as the initiator the copolymers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9961009864498231847", "cites_id": ["9961009864498231847"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001430579390109S", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JzqUMbKdPIoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
