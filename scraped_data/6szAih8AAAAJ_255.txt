The specificity of the 1-methyl-1-(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl radical (I) for reaction with styrene over MMA is substantially enhanced by the presence of very low concentrations of EASC. This behaviour is consistent with the involvement of a complexes radical and suggests that such species may play an important role in Lewis acid induced alternating copolymerization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3915035138150940215", "cites_id": ["3915035138150940215"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00309700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N76oJLf_VDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
