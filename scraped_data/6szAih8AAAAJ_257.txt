However, plastics are often treated only as disposable commodities, which has led to the ever-increasing accumulation of plastic and plastic by-products in the environment as waste, and an unacceptable growth of microplastic and nanoplastic pollution. The catchphrase \u201cplastics are everywhere\u201d, perhaps once seen as extolling the virtues of plastics, is now seen by most as a potential or actual threat. Scientists are confronting this environmental crisis, both by developing recycling methods to deal with the legacy of plastic waste, and by highlighting the need to develop and implement effective whole-of-life strategies in the future use of plastic materials. The importance and topicality of this subject are evidenced by the dramatic increase in the use of terms such as \u201cwhole of life\u201d, \u201clife-cycle assessment\u201d, \u201ccircular economy\u201d and \u201csustainable polymers\u201d in the scientific and broader literature. Effective solutions, however, are still to be forthcoming. In this review, we assess the potential for implementing whole-of-life strategies for plastics to achieve our vision of a circular economy. In this context, we consider the ways in which given plastics might be recycled into the same plastic for potential use in the same application, with minimal material loss, the lowest energy cost, and the least potential for polluting the environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:MGPUR4WVBMEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15184574639261081672", "cites_id": ["15184574639261081672"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8218", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SOCP3i5yutIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
