We tested the method by calculating the melt structures of linear polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the spinodal decomposition temperatures for PE/iPP blends. The computational expense of the PRISM calculation was reduced with a single\u2010site united atom model in which the polyolefin CH, CH2, and CH3 groups were approximated as chemically equivalent sites with spherically symmetric energetic interactions. The site\u2013site interactions were defined by a potential function comprising a hard core with an attractive Lennard\u2013Jones term. These energetic parameters were optimized with a central composite design strategy that enabled a simultaneous fit of experimental melt density and structure factor data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=804946518652510423", "cites_id": ["804946518652510423"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/polb.1155", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:12B4C5i-KwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
