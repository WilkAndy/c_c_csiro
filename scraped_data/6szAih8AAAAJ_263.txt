Particular attention will be paid to the advances made with the use of polymers prepared with specifically labelled initiators and monomers. There have been many studies on the NMR of polymers with the aim of ascertaining the tacticity of the polymer prepared under various conditions. One of the most widely studied polymers is PMMA. The advantages of preparing polymers from labelled precursors will be demonstrated through consideration of the NMR of PMMA prepared from MMA-carbonyl-{sup 13}C{sup 5}. 34 refs., 7 figs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12618962134329128102", "cites_id": ["12618962134329128102"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/5872196", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pvTK-jOPH68J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
