The latter process gives methyl and phenyl radicals, respectively, which, in turn, may also react with styrene. While tert-butoxy radicals give exclusive addition to the less substituted end of the double bond (tail addition), the reaction of benzoyloxy is nonselective, affording products from tail addition, head addition, and aromatic substitution in the ratio of 79: 6: 14. Phenyl radicals give tail addition and aromatic substitution (99: 1).
