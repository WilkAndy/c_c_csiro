The physical and mechanical properties of the synthetic polymers, formed by chain polymerization, depend critically on the arrangement and relative configuration of monomer units within the chains. The chapter discusses the tacticity of homopolymers and monomer sequence distribution of copolymers prepared from 1- or 1,l-disubstituted olefins. The syntheses of many of the monomers, commonly used in chain polymerizations that are specifically 13C-labelled, are summarized in this chapter. It is noted that the synthesis of carbon-14 labeled monomers can usually be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14480099925617868277", "cites_id": ["14480099925617868277"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0066410308601349", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9f2c2imm88gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
