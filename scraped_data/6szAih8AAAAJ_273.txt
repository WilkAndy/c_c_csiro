This method offers considerable advantages in both simplicity and computation speed over methods already in the literature. A computer program for performing the calculation on systems with up to 10 components is briefly described. Approximate probabilities for the existence of critical points in ternary and quaternary systems have been evaluated as a function of whether binary critical points exist for pairs of the monomers involved. These data show that, contrary to the widely held view, in systems of three or more components all rij > 1 or all rij < 1is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the existence of a critical point.
