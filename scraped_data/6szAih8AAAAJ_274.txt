To account for this several models have been proposed to describe the kinetics of copolymerization. One of the first* T*\" T\" which still has many adherents, assumes that the reactions shown in Table 1 are sufficient to describe copolymerization. The termination process is said to be'chemically controlled'and cross termination to have a significantly higher rate constant than homotermination. The rate constants for termination are usually given in terms of the parameter p, defined in equation (1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8864959702342426470", "cites_id": ["8864959702342426470"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46303112/On_the_Relative_Importance_of_Cross-_and20160607-10823-166xf11.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zt9FduGpBnsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
