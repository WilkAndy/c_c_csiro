Many forms of chain polymerization can be distinguished according to the mechanism of the propagation step (eg, cyclopolymerization\u2013when rings are formed, condensative chain polymerization\u2013when propagation is a condensation reaction, group-transfer polymerization, polyinsertion, ring-opening polymerization\u2013when rings are opened), whether they involve a termination step or not (eg, living polymerization\u2013when termination is absent, reversible-deactivation polymerization), whether a transfer step is involved (eg, degenerative-transfer polymerization), and the type of chain carrier or active site (eg, radical, ion, electrophile, nucleophile, coordination complex).
