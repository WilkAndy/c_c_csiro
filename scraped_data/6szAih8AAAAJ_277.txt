The additive undergoes polymerization-induced phase segregation (PIPS) to self-assemble on the coating surface as discrete discoid nanofeatures during the resin cure process. Moreover, the copolymer facilitates surface co-segregation of titanium dioxide pigment microparticulate present in the coating. Depending on the composition, the coatings can display persistent superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning properties and, surprisingly, the titanium dioxide pigmented coatings that include the siloxane copolymer additive display high levels of antibacterial performance against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. This antibacterial performance is believed to be associated with the unique surface topology of these coatings, which comprise stimuli-responsive discoid nanofeatures. This paper provides details of the surface morphology of the coatings and how these relates to the antimicrobial properties of the coating."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:hefNtdE4IMkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=613577459521313227", "cites_id": ["613577459521313227"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/573022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y1n01HLdgwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4}}
