With appropriate selection of the RAFT agent for the monomers and reaction conditions, it is applicable to the majority of monomers subject to radical polymerization. The process can be used in the synthesis of well\u2010defined homo\u2010, gradient, diblock, triblock, and star polymers and more complex architectures, which include microgels and polymer brushes. In this Focus Review we describe how the development of RAFT and RAFT application has been facilitated by the adoption of continuous flow techniques using tubular reactors and through the use of high\u2010throughput methodology. Applications described include the use of RAFT in the preparation of polymers for optoelectronics, block copolymer therapeutics, and star polymer rheology control agents."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 354, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6989797229351824644", "cites_id": ["6989797229351824644"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.201300262", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BG2G64u_AGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 35, "2015": 38, "2016": 46, "2017": 37, "2018": 32, "2019": 42, "2020": 31, "2021": 33, "2022": 37, "2023": 19}}
