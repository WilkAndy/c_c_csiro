Radical-promoted thiol-ene processes are also briefly discussed. We detail the strategies for achieving selectivity with respect to single unit insertion vs oligomerization and look critically at progress towards discrete oligomer synthesis by consecutive SUMI reactions. We examine the use of SUMI to install \u03b1-, \u03c9- or mid-chain-functionality in RDRP-synthesized polymers. Finally, we examine the prospects for using radical-promoted SUMI in the synthesis of sequence-defined polymers where monomer placement is precisely defined to the level of the individual monomer units in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:x2hKVfJWtf0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17465696112829352914", "cites_id": ["17465696112829352914"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079670023000035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0ksd0BOeYvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4}}
