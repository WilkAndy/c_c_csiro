As members of the Subcommittee on Polymer Terminology (SPT) in the Polymer Division of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), we are concerned that these terms are confusing because they do not describe the fundamental differences in the growth of polymers by these methods. For example, both polymerization methods are comprised of a series of steps, and both produce polymer chains. In an effort to recommend comprehensive terms, a 1994 IUPAC Recommendation from the then version of SPT suggested polycondensation and polyaddition as terms for the two variants of \u201cstep-growth polymerization\u201d, and similarly chain polymerization and condensative chain polymerization for the two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:L7vk9XBBNxgC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10560017984171384688", "cites_id": ["10560017984171384688"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/py/d2py00086e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cJ9FQGi4jJIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
