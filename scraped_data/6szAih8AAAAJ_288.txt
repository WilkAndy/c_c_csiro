Selective double thiol-Michael reactions on a series of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates (PEGDA), that differed in average chain length, with two molar equivalents of the trithiol trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate) (TMPTMP) yielded well-defined telechelic poly(ethylene glycol)-based tetrathiols. These tetrathiols were in turn used to produce model (co\u2013)networks by photo-induced radical thiol-ene polymerization with either the same poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates or with tri(ethyleneglycol) divinylether (TEGDVE). The properties of these networks were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:4QKQTXcH0q8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2773290798612932060,12592506333469029269", "cites_id": ["2773290798612932060", "12592506333469029269"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305721001749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3OUurkm1fCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4}}
