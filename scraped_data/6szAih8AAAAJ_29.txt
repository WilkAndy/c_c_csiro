A variety of processes have now been reported in this context. These include reactions with nucleophiles, radical\u2010induced reactions, thermolysis, electrocyclic reactions and \u2018click\u2019 processes. We also consider the use of RAFT\u2010synthesized polymers in the construction of block or graft copolymers, functional nanoparticles and biopolymer conjugates where transformation of the thiocarbonylthio group is an integral part of the process. This includes the use of RAFT\u2010synthesized polymers in other forms of radical polymerization such as atom transfer radical polymerization or nitroxide\u2010mediated polymerization, and the \u2018switching\u2019 of thiocarbonylthio groups to enable control over polymerization of a wider range of monomers in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 353, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5906714465419106910,1788965783396692447", "cites_id": ["5906714465419106910", "1788965783396692447"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pi.2988", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xpr33ILd-FEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 17, "2012": 33, "2013": 34, "2014": 28, "2015": 30, "2016": 25, "2017": 34, "2018": 34, "2019": 23, "2020": 17, "2021": 38, "2022": 28, "2023": 9}}
