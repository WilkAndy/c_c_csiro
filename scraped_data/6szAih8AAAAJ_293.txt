Continuous developments in experimental workflows for commercially available automated parallel synthesizers and characterization platforms have contributed significantly to the progress in this field. Over the past 20\u2009years, these experimental methods have enabled detailed kinetic investigations of a significant number of RAFT polymerizations in the preparation of comprehensive polymer libraries that have facilitated materials selection in cutting\u2010edge technologies, such as nanomedicine and organic electronics. Nevertheless, HT/HO\u2010E for polymer research is still at its dawn.
