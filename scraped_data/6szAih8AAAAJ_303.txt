In this paper, we show that the homopolymerisation of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) can be kinetically modelled using a much-simplified method involving only a few kinetic parameters. The experimental polymerisation of NIPAM was performed with 4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio)pentanoic acid as the RAFT agent and 4,4\u2032-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) as the initiator in dioxane at three different temperatures (60, 70 and 80\u202f\u00b0C) with the initial [RAFT]:[initiator] ratio kept at 5:1 and different initial [monomer]:[RAFT] ranging from 100:0.2 to 100:1. Our method for the kinetic simulation makes use of a pseudo-concentration of polymer, in which all chains are assumed to have the same \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:yJjnfzR0HrkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=614255981842461269", "cites_id": ["614255981842461269"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305719302149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VfLgno9GhggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
