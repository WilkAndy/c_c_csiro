Analysis of this relationship shows that in a situation where one critical point would have been expected on the basis of terminal-model kinetics (no penultimate group effect) a modest penultimate group effect can mean that zero, one or three critical points may exist, or, in systems where no critical points would have been predicted, two critical points may exist."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14701553238929787523", "cites_id": ["14701553238929787523"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH9851287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g0rnVMdoBswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
