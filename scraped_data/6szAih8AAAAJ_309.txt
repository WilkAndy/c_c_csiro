We demonstrate the utility of our emulsion eRAFT process with the synthesis of low dispersity multiblock copolymers by seeded RAFT emulsion polymerization at ambient temperature (\u223c30 \u00b0C). Thus, a triblock, poly(butyl methacrylate)-block-polystyrene-block-poly(4-methylstyrene) [PBMA-b-PSt-b-PMS], and a tetrablock, poly(butyl methacrylate)-block-polystyrene-block-poly(styrene-stat-butyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene [PBMA-b-PSt-b-P(BA-stat-St)-b-PSt], were synthesized as free-flowing, colloidally stable latexes commencing with a surfactant-free poly(butyl methacrylate) macroRAFT agent seed latex. A straightforward sequential addition strategy with no intermediate purification steps was able to be employed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:uEM9VtRl8xsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=601792671042552933", "cites_id": ["601792671042552933"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsmacrolett.3c00021", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
