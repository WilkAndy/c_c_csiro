However, it is usually required that the RAFT agent be selected according to the types of monomer being polymerized. Thus, RAFT agents (dithioesters, trithiocarbonates) suitable for controlling polymerization of \u201cmore activated\u201d monomers (MAMs; e.g., styrene, acrylates, methacrylates, etc.) tend to inhibit polymerization of \u201cless activated\u201d monomers (LAMs; e.g., vinyl acetate, N-vinylpyrrolidone, etc.). Similarly RAFT agents suitable for polymerizations of LAMs (xanthates, certain dithiocarbamates) tend to give little or poor control over polymerizations of MAMs. We now report a new class of \u201cswitchable\u201d RAFT agents, N-(4-pyridinyl)-N-methyldithiocarbamates, that provide excellent control over polymerization of LAMs and, after addition of 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 333, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3884047075858828685", "cites_id": ["3884047075858828685"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja901955n", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jc11pzzo5jUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 21, "2011": 31, "2012": 27, "2013": 28, "2014": 22, "2015": 28, "2016": 28, "2017": 22, "2018": 22, "2019": 22, "2020": 26, "2021": 23, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
