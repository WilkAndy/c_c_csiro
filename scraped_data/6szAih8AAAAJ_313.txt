The N-(4-pyridinyl)-N-methyldithiocarbamates (1-4)[1, 2] provide excellent control over polymerization of less activated monomers (LAMs)(vinyl acetate, N-vinylcarbazole), and, after addition of an equivalent of a protic or Lewis acid, become effective in controlling polymerization of more activated monomers (MAMs)(styrene, methyl methacrylate). They allow a convenient synthesis of polyMAM-block-polyLAM with narrow molecular weight distributions. Aryl trthiocarbonates (5)[3] provide higher transfer constants than the more commonly encountered alkyl trithiocarbonates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8912079313543157578", "cites_id": ["8912079313543157578"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP106432&dsid=DS3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:StfY3eoQrnsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
