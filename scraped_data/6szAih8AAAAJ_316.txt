The process includes polymerizing monoethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of a chain transfer agent to form macromonomers each having a terminal polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated group and then polymerizing, in presence of the macromonomers, the monoethylenically unsaturated monomers and multi-olefinic crosslinking monomers. The microgels of the present invention can be used as rheology control agents in waterborne and solvent-borne coatings and in adhesives and cosmetics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:kUhpeDhEZMUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2919578979054765549", "cites_id": ["2919578979054765549"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US6653407B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7cVB5JxthCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
