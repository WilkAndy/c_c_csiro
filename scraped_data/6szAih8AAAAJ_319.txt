The control of the monomer sequence has often been described as the \u201choly grail\u201d of synthetic polymer chemistry, with the ultimate goal being synthetic access to polymers of a \u201cperfect\u201d structure, where each monomeric building block is placed at a desired position along the polymer chain. Given that polymer properties are intimately linked to the microstructure and monomer distribution along the constituent chains, it goes without saying that there exist seemingly endless opportunities in terms of fine-tuning the properties of such materials by careful consideration of the length of each block, the number and order of blocks, and the inclusion of monomers with specific functional groups. The area of multiblock copolymer synthesis remains relatively unexplored, in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:U3qCfcK-7lkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2007/36/d2cs00115b", "cites_per_year": {}}
