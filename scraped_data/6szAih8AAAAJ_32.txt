The efficiency of reduction is strongly dependent on the H-donor and the polymer. The effectiveness of the H atom donors studied increases in the series toluene \u226a 2-propanol < triethylsilane < triphenylsilane \u226a tris(trimethylsilyl)silane \u223c N-ethylpiperidine hypophosphite < tributylstannane. The end groups of the (meth)acrylic polymers, e.g., poly(butyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate), are more readily reduced than those of polystyrene. With poor H-donors such as toluene or 2-propanol radical\u2212radical reaction between propagating radicals competes with reduction even when they are used in vast excess as a solvent for the process.
