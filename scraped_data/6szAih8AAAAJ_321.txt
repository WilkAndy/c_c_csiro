The existing IUPAC organic, polymer, and inorganic nomenclature principles can be applied to name such conjugates but it is not always appropriate. These nomenclatures have two major shortcomings: (1) the resulting names are often excessively long and (2) identification of the components (substrate, active species, and link) can be difficult. The new IUPAC naming system elaborates rules for unambiguous and facile naming of any conjugate. This naming system is not intended to replace the existing nomenclature but to provide a suitable alternative when dictated by necessity. Although the rules are intended to be primarily applicable to the naming of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:e3CVSTJ63dQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/pac-2020-0502/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7pXib_fT-eMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
