A rationale for selecting the most appropriate thiocarbonylthio compounds for a particular monomer type is presented with reference to the polymerization of methacrylates, styrenes, acrylates, acrylamides and vinyl acetate. The efficacy of the process is further demonstrated by the synthesis of narrow polydispersity polystyrene-block-poly (methyl acrylate)-block-polystyrene and 4-armed star polystyrene."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:yeL6HyUMUGUC", "num_citations": 305, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16951804786972318045,10514321406612881551,16481216759047835621", "cites_id": ["16951804786972318045", "10514321406612881551", "16481216759047835621"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50040352/Synthesis_of_Defined_Polymers_by_Reversi20161101-11301-m0jxaz.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XVlApaPoQOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 9, "2002": 26, "2003": 19, "2004": 19, "2005": 30, "2006": 35, "2007": 19, "2008": 24, "2009": 20, "2010": 9, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
