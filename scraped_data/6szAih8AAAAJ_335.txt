Sequence control by single unit monomer insertion (SUMI),\u2018one at a time\u2019, into dithiobenzoate RAFT agents has been explored. Macro-RAFT [(CH3) 3C (CN)-(M)-SC (= S)-phenyl] synthesis by SUMI of styrene and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) into 2-cyano-2-propyl dithiobenzoate was successful. However, attempted SUMI of maleic anhydride (MAH) gave low yield consistent with the low reactivity of MAH towards 2-cyano-2-propyl radicals. Insertion of methyl methacrylate (MMA) provided an oligomeric insertion product due to the low transfer constant of the dithiobenzoate in MMA polymerization. Next, A step towards the controlled synthesis of macro-RAFT [(CH3) 3C (CN)-(M1)-(M2)-SC (= S)-phenyl] was taken. The insertion of MAH, styrene and NIPAm into the styrene SUMI product has been investigated. Insertion of MAH into the macro-RAFT was fast, however, reactions with styrene and NIPAm were slow attributed both to the low concentration of monomer used and the poor leaving group ability of the propagating species. This study demonstrates the potential of RAFT for the synthesis of a new generation of synthetic polymers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://sciforum.net/manuscripts/2358/manuscript.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M3TjKklweOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
