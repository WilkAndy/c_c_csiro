These polymers are capable of responding to a variety of external stimuli, which include optical, electrical, thermal, mechanical, redox, pH, chemical, environmental and biological signals. They are encountered in many environments. They can have a variety of architectures (e.g., copolymers, blocks, stars). They may be present as isolated macromolecules in a medium, as supramolecular assemblies, as smart coatings, as networks or some combination of these possibilities. This paper is concerned with the process of forming such polymers by radical polymerization with reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT). RAFT polymerization has an advantage over most processes for reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) in its tolerance of a wide range of unprotected functionalities.
