The effect of strength (pKa) and stoichiometry of the acid used to switch the RAFT agent on the molecular weight and dispersity of PDMAm were examined, making use of high-throughput protocol. Best control was achieved with a stoichiometric amount of the strongest acid investigated, p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. Use of weaker acids (higher pKa) or less than stoichiometric amounts of acid with respect to RAFT agent resulted in broader molecular weight distributions. These results can be rationalized in terms of the extent of protonation of the pyridine nitrogen of the RAFT agent (pKa~ 3.13). The preparation of unimodal low dispersity block copolymers"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:8uzoZH4hB9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46303126/Switchable_Reversible_Addition-Fragmenta20160607-5672-8ehwnj.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zg7sa1LEG7cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
