The research is illustrated by work on with the antitumor drug SN38, to improve water solubility and cell viability, and the delivery of siRNA, for gene silencing. The RAFT polymers are conjugated to the active through a covalent linkage, in the case of anticancer drug SN38, and by ionic association, for the case of siRNA. Preliminary results are extremely encouraging. The synthesized RAFT ABA triblock polymers provided 100% siRNA uptake and gave gene silencing similar to that of the transfection reagent Lipofectamine\u2122. In both examples RAFT-acive conjugates polymers were well-tolerated showing no discernable cell cytotoxicity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/raft-polymerzation-for-delivery-of-bioactives", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mk-LqM3bsGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
