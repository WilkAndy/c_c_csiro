The traditional methods of producing block polymers, whether by living polymerization or by the linking of end-functional polymers, suffer many disadvantages. The living polymerization method, if by ionic, coordination, or group-transfer mechanisms, has limitations both for economic reasons(due to the stringent requirements on reaction conditions and monomer purity) and because of the limited range of monomers that are compatible with this technique. 1 The end-linking method suffers from problems associated with producingpure end-functional polymersand difficulties associated with conducting reactions between polymers. These problems havebrought about a marked growth in interest in methods \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 273, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6699912847524946839", "cites_id": ["6699912847524946839"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00119a034", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l-PMtjzf-lwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 6, "1997": 6, "1998": 13, "1999": 5, "2000": 13, "2001": 9, "2002": 10, "2003": 9, "2004": 12, "2005": 20, "2006": 9, "2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 15, "2020": 9, "2021": 17, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
