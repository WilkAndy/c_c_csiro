With applications ranging from surfactants, dispersants, coatings and adhesives, to microelectronics, membranes, drug delivery, and biomaterials they have the potential of revolutionizing a large part of the polymer industry. Recently, we reported an effective and versatile living radical polymerization process which functions by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT process). The process is performed simply by adding a suitable thiocarbonylthio compound to an otherwise conventional free radical polymerization. (Example polymers include polystyrene, PMMA, and polyvinyl alcohol.)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=678421306106054656&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
