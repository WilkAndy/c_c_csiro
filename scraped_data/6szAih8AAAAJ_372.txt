The intrinsic viscosity (IV) of PET from commercial polymerization reactors is usually below 0.7. An IV below 0.7 is not sufficient for many polymer processing techniques such as extrusion, film blowing, thermoforming and foaming and thus PET has had restricted use in these applications. One approach to increasing molecular weight (and intrinsic viscosity) is by chain extension in the melt phse with suitable \"chain extenders\" which react readily with the hydroxyl and/or carboxyl end groups of PET polymer chains. Chain extenders/branching agents are relatively small multi-functional coupling agents. Chain extenders not only extend the polymer molecules linearly but also introduce chain branching and cross-linking. The physical properties of chain-extended/branched PET are rarely addressed.
