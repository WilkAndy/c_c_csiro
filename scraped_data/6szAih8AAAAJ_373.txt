The use of PET in fields such as film blowing, thermoforming and foam extrusion is limited due to its narrow processing window and the need for specialized processing equipment caused by its low molecular weight and its propensity to hydrolysis by retained moisture and contaminants. The introduction of branching into PET should result in improved melt strength and extensional viscosity. The CRC for Polymers has recently developed a process for synthesizing high melt strength PET by reactive extrusion (WO 9833837 (Chem. Abstr. 129:176164)). The melt processing of PET by reactive extrusion has numerous advantages such as its lower cost and it may be applied to recycling technologies. The major objective of this study was to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5132105615662511915&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
