The RAFT process developed at our CSIRO laboratories is conducted simply by the addition of a RAFT agent, a thiocarbonylthio compound of general structure (ZC (= S) SR) to a conventional radical polymerization. Suitable RAFT agents include dithioesters, trithiocarbonates, xanthates, dithiocarbamates and our latest switchable N-alkyl-N-pyridyldithiocarbamates. These thiocarbonylthio compounds confer living characteristics to the radical polymerization by a mechanism of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer and provide exceptional control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, composition and architecture of the resulting polymers. The process can be applied to most monomers polymerizable by radical polymerization and offers a convenient route to well-defined homo-, gradient, diblock, triblock and star polymers as well as more complex architectures including microgels and polymer brushes. Applications of RAFT polymers ranging from surfactants, dispersants, coatings and adhesives, to biomaterials, diagnostics, drug delivery, and optoelectronics are being explored extensively by many academics and industrial researchers the world over."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:X5YyAB84Iw4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5432951840219452726&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
