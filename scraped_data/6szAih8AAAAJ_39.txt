The scope, advantages, limitations and specificity of various REX processes for are examined in this context. The processes covered include: the grafting of monomers from starch as single units, such as ring-opening of epoxides, esterification (with lactones, anhydrides, acids, halides or vinyl esters) phosphorylation and silylation; graft polymerization from starch by radical-induced grafting or the ring-opening polymerization of lactones; reactive compatibilization with polyesters and polyolefins by grafting to or from starch; crosslinking of starch with epichlorohydrin or by phosphorylation; and the degradation of starch thermally or catalyzed by acid or enzymes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 267, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3136603901399971715", "cites_id": ["3136603901399971715"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007967001000122X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g7cMQKF0hysJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 21, "2013": 21, "2014": 19, "2015": 30, "2016": 18, "2017": 21, "2018": 28, "2019": 18, "2020": 23, "2021": 30, "2022": 19, "2023": 14}}
