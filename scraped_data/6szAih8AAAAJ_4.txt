Thus, recent work suggests that nitroxidemediated polymerization, although it can be successfully used for making block copolymers based on styrene and derivatives, 3 appears to have less utility for other systems. 4, 5 Atom transfer radical polymerization6 has limitations with monomers or initiators containing acid functionality (eg, methacrylic acid7) and provides products contaminated with metal ions. Although these and other problems may sometimes be mitigated by appropriate selection of the reagents and reaction conditions, there is, nonetheless, a clear need for a more versatile process.Recently, we reported a new living radical polymerization (reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer, the RAFT process) that offers exceptional versatility in providing polymers of predetermined molecular weight and very narrow polydispersity (usually< 1.2, sometimes< 1.1). 8, 9 This is achieved by performing the polymerization in the presence of certain dithio compounds (eg, dithiobenzoates 1a-d) which act as highly"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 1247, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10221639901616163863,11001129276623377701,14571633916599469686,10849905234636052625", "cites_id": ["10221639901616163863", "11001129276623377701", "14571633916599469686", "10849905234636052625"], "pub_url": "http://polymer.chem.cmu.edu/~kmatweb/published/other_groups/1999/RizzardoRAFTBlocks.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F0zKfVWP2o0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 7, "2000": 38, "2001": 48, "2002": 62, "2003": 55, "2004": 66, "2005": 84, "2006": 70, "2007": 74, "2008": 78, "2009": 66, "2010": 61, "2011": 61, "2012": 55, "2013": 55, "2014": 51, "2015": 59, "2016": 55, "2017": 41, "2018": 31, "2019": 40, "2020": 31, "2021": 28, "2022": 20, "2023": 7}}
