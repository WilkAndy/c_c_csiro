Living character is conferred to conventional free radical polymerization by the addition of a thiocarbonylthio compound of general structure S=C(Z)SR, for example, S=C(Ph)SC(CH3)2Ph. The mechanism involves Reversible Addition\u2010Fragmentation chain Transfer and, for convenience of referral, we have designated it the RAFT polymerization. The process is compatible with a very wide range of monomers including functional monomers such as acrylic acid, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. Examples of narrow polydispersity (\u22641.2) homopolymers, copolymers, gradient copolymers, end\u2010functional polymers, star polymers, A\u2010B diblock and A\u2010B\u2010A triblock copolymers are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 267, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14785490386207791107,13466806740297972738", "cites_id": ["14785490386207791107", "13466806740297972738"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.19991430122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A1jeWyudMM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 9, "2001": 12, "2002": 19, "2003": 20, "2004": 17, "2005": 31, "2006": 21, "2007": 15, "2008": 18, "2009": 13, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
