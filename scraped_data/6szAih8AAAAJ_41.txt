The reaction rates are slower than expected for diffusion control. Within the limits of experimental error the coupling rate constant, feT, for each radical is ca. 1 X 109 M\" 1 s-1 and is given by log kT= 9.7-0.9/0. Tempo couples with carbon-centered radicals at similar rates. The coupling reaction can be used as a kinetic probe. By this means discrepancies in existing data for some clocks have been resolved and the cyclopropylmethyl-butenyl radical rearrangement has been recalibrated (log kT= 13.3-7.4/0)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 250, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6358611424266777405", "cites_id": ["6358611424266777405"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo00243a008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PXMpqGZTPlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 6, "1990": 8, "1991": 10, "1992": 5, "1993": 13, "1994": 21, "1995": 12, "1996": 10, "1997": 15, "1998": 13, "1999": 10, "2000": 14, "2001": 11, "2002": 12, "2003": 4, "2004": 11, "2005": 2, "2006": 9, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
