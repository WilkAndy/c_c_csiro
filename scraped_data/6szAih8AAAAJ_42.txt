Such polymerizations require use of a suitable compound [Z\u2010(C=X)X\u2010R], which is selected to have a very high transfer constants in radical polymerization of the desired monomers, and appropriate choice of reaction conditions. Block and multiblock polymers, stars and grafts are available through use of precursors containing multiple thiocarbonylthio groups. Stars and microgels are also available through self assembly and crosslinking of RAFT synthesized block copolymer micelles and by a varient of the \u2018arm\u2010first\u2019 approach wherein of a diene monomer is (co)polymerized in the presence of a preformed RAFT\u2010made polymer.
