End group determination suggests that bimodal molecular weight distributions and long chain branches in PBA arise by copolymerization of a PBA macromonomer formed by backbiting \u03b2-scission. The S-phthalimidomethyl xanthates provide good control over polymerizations of the less-activated monomers N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) and vinyl acetate (VAc). In the case of PBA with a trithiocarbonate end or PVAc with a xanthate end, the C\u2212S \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 235, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7172158528385865980", "cites_id": ["7172158528385865980"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0604338", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_Fg6jS6giGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 15, "2008": 28, "2009": 18, "2010": 11, "2011": 20, "2012": 14, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 17, "2016": 10, "2017": 13, "2018": 12, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 16, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
