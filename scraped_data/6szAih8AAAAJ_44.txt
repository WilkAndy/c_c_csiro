Transfer constants were determined by analysis of the ln chain length distributions. The dimer (1) was found to be substantially less effective as a chain transfer agent than the trimer (2) or the higher macromonomers (3, 4) [CT(60 \u00b0C) 1, 0.013; 2, 0.19; 3, 0.31; 4, 0.21]. The transfer constants show only a small temperature dependence and no variation with conversion. No discernible retardation was observed in these polymerizations. A reduced yield of polymer observed at conversions >10% in bulk polymerizations of MMA carried out in the presence of 1\u22124 can be attributed to the absence of the gel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 208, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9852221451331589702", "cites_id": ["9852221451331589702"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma960852c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RlYa7zUfuogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 6, "1999": 8, "2000": 12, "2001": 8, "2002": 11, "2003": 13, "2004": 15, "2005": 11, "2006": 13, "2007": 4, "2008": 11, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
