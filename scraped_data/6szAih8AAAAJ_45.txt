The absence of consistent value for rate coefficients poses major problems in the deduction of mechanisms of polymerization reactions and in their modeling: the present diversity in reported kinetic parameters is such that \u201cevidence\u201d can even be obtained for mutually contradictory mechanisms. This short communication is an attempt (by an international group of polymer chemists meeting under the auspices of the IUPAC Working Party on \u201cModeling of Free Radical Polymerization Kinetics and Processing\u201d) to initiate a solution to this problem by seeing if agreement exists on the values of some fundamental kinetic parameters for simple monomers, determined using quite different experimental techniques (eg, comparing bulk \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=109164709275382299", "cites_id": ["109164709275382299"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pol.1988.140260704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GzJehrnUgwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 4, "1991": 10, "1992": 11, "1993": 20, "1994": 16, "1995": 14, "1996": 11, "1997": 14, "1998": 11, "1999": 7, "2000": 9, "2001": 7, "2002": 9, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 8, "2006": 7, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
