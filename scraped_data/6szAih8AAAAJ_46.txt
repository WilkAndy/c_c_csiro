The activity of the phthalimidomethyl trithiocarbonates in RAFT polymerization of styrene, which appears to be similar to that of analogous benzyl trithiocarbonates, is attributed to the electrophilic character of the phthalimidomethyl group. The trithiocarbonate functionality in the products was quantitatively transformed to inert chain ends either by radical-induced reduction with tributylstannane or by thermal elimination, allowing the phthalimido end groups to be cleanly converted to primary amine end groups by hydrazinolysis. Thermolysis experiments, in which the polymers are cleaved at the trithiocarbonate linkage, also provide information on the mechanism of RAFT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 194, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10004361190223055856", "cites_id": ["10004361190223055856"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma060245h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8AvzQ3-h1ooJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 17, "2009": 18, "2010": 19, "2011": 17, "2012": 13, "2013": 9, "2014": 13, "2015": 14, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 1, "2019": 11, "2020": 12, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
