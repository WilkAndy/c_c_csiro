Under these conditions, macromonomers of high purity can be prepared (Table 1 and Figure 1). However, reaction temperatures are not restricted to above 150 C, and with appropriate choice of monomer concentration, we have prepared polyacrylate macromonomers at temperatures in the range 80-240 C"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12413971556023468833", "cites_id": ["12413971556023468833"], "pub_url": "http://polymer.chem.cmu.edu/~kmatweb/1999/Oct1999/Macromol%20Langmuir/Chiefari%20CT%20for%20Grafts.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IQOVsFtJR6wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 9, "2002": 9, "2003": 7, "2004": 9, "2005": 8, "2006": 10, "2007": 4, "2008": 14, "2009": 13, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
