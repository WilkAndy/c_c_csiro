However, a robust and versatile synthetic strategy for these materials remains one of the great challenges in polymer synthesis. Herein we describe proof\u2010of\u2010principle experiments for a modular strategy to produce discrete oligomers by a visible\u2010light\u2010mediated radical chain process. We utilize the high selectivity provided by photo\u2010induced electron/energy transfer (PET) activation to develop efficient single unit monomer insertion (SUMI) into reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain\u2010transfer (RAFT) agents. A variety of discrete oligomers (single unit species, dimers, and, for the first time, trimers) have been synthesized by sequential SUMI in very high yield under mild reaction conditions. The trimers were used as building blocks for the construction of uniform \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12714574657177498504", "cites_id": ["12714574657177498504"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201610223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iLM_N0k-c7AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 13, "2018": 28, "2019": 29, "2020": 27, "2021": 31, "2022": 30, "2023": 16}}
