Optoelectronic applications include hole/electron transport in photovoltaics (OPVs), light emitting diodes (OLEDs and PLEDs), thin-film transistors (TFTs), sensors, light-harvesting and related applications. In this context we consider metallopolymers (polymers that incorporate a metal or possess metal ligating functionality as a pendant group to the backbone, as an end-group or as a connecting group), organic semiconductors (polymers with an organic semiconductor moiety either as a block or as a pendant group), and various surfaces, nanoparticles and quantum dots that are formed by RAFT polymerization or where a RAFT-synthesized polymer forms an integral part of the process or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12009923120881972766", "cites_id": ["12009923120881972766"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2011/py/c0py00179a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hrbrd3LRq6YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 22, "2013": 25, "2014": 17, "2015": 15, "2016": 12, "2017": 15, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
