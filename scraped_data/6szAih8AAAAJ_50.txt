A key feature of RAFT polymerization is that the thiocarbonylthio group (s), present in the initial RAFT agent, is (are) retained in the polymeric product (s). The retention of these groups is responsible for the polymers\u2019 living character. However, the presence of the thiocarbonylthio groups also means that the polymers are usually colored. The polymers may also, in some cases, be odorous or release an odor over time due to decomposition of the thiocarbonylthio groups and the evolution of volatile sulfur-containing compounds. The presence of such color and odor can be disadvantageous in some applications. Even though some of these issues may be largely mitigated or overcome by more appropriate selection of the initial RAFT agent, there has nonetheless been some incentive to develop effective methods for treatment of RAFT-made polymers to cleave the thiocarbonylthio end-groups postpolymerization. A variety of methods for removing the thiocarbonylthio groups have been reported. These include radicalinduced reduction (to provide a hydrocarbon endgroup), 5, 6 radical exchange, 7, 8 reaction with nucleophiles (eg, amine, 1, 6, 9-13 hydroxide, 14, 15 borohydride16, 17 sto provide a thiol end-group), treatment with oxidizing agents (eg, NaOCl, 1 H2O2, 1 tBuOOH18), and UV irradiation. 19-21 Of these existing processes, only the radical-induced reactions are known \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6153976389331204248", "cites_id": ["6153976389331204248"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42278612/Thermolysis_of_RAFT-Synthesized_Polymers20160207-4681-ldwm37.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mDg6wutQZ1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 18, "2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 14, "2010": 12, "2011": 11, "2012": 7, "2013": 13, "2014": 6, "2015": 12, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
