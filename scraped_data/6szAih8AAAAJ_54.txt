The process is based on the polymerization of monomers in the presence of macromonomers of general structure CH2=C(Z)CH2(A)n [(A)n= radical leaving group, Z = activating group] and displays many of the characteristics of living polymerizations. The process is most suited to methacrylic monomers but with the appropriate choice of reaction conditions (high temperatures and/or low conversions) it can also be applied to acrylic and styrenic monomers. The macromonomers are conveniently prepared by catalytic chain transfer to alkyl cobalt(III) complexes or by addition\u2010fragmentation chain transfer. The factors which determine the efficiency of cobalt complexes for molecular weight reduction in free radical emulsion and solution polymerization of methyl methacrylate are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8329687229125597229", "cites_id": ["8329687229125597229"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.19961110104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LZgj_mb-mHMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 7, "1999": 6, "2000": 8, "2001": 10, "2002": 14, "2003": 15, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
