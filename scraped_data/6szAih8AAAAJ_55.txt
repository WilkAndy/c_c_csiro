It is proposed that a small chain length dependence of kp (overall) may, in part, be a consequence of a marked chain length dependence of kp for the first few propagation steps [i.e. kp(1) > kp(2) < kp(3) \u2265 kp(\u22654)]. The propagation rate constant for styrene polymerization is given by the expression: In kp = 16,09 \u2212 28950/(RT) (overall) or In kp = 16,47 \u2212 30084/(RT) (chain length \u2265 4). Kinetic simulation has been applied both as an aid in data analysis and to demonstrate the reliability of the PLP technique for evaluation of propagation rate constants (kp) in radical polymerization. This has been achieved by examining the sensitivity of the molecular weight distribution of polymers formed in PLP experiments to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6899495074453447456", "cites_id": ["6899495074453447456"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.1993.021940617", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IONaEjfuv18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 11, "1995": 11, "1996": 12, "1997": 10, "1998": 7, "1999": 7, "2000": 7, "2001": 10, "2002": 15, "2003": 14, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
