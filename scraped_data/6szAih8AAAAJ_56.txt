A quantitative product analysis has shown that these inhibitors react by hydrogen abstraction from a thermally generated styrene dimer (1-phenyl-1,2,3,9-tetrahydronaphthalene) and to a minor extent by addition to the double bond of styrene monomer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6429398667944610228", "cites_id": ["6429398667944610228"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00255160", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tEk1KgbQOVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 10, "1997": 6, "1998": 6, "1999": 5, "2000": 9, "2001": 8, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 1}}
