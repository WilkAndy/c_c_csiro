J. Chem. 2005, 58, 379\u2013410). The first update was published in November 2006 (Aust. J. Chem. 2006, 59, 669\u2013692). This review cites over 500 papers that appeared during the period mid-2006 to mid-2009 covering various aspects of RAFT polymerization ranging from reagent synthesis and properties, kinetics and mechanism of polymerization, novel polymer syntheses and a diverse range of applications. Significant developments have occurred, particularly in the areas of novel RAFT agents, techniques for end-group removal and transformation, the production of micro/nanoparticles and modified surfaces, and biopolymer conjugates both for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:oTdOBqtIf_kC", "num_citations": 1141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=70366639226409448", "cites_id": ["70366639226409448"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch09311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6NEg5xX--QAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 51, "2011": 93, "2012": 125, "2013": 110, "2014": 114, "2015": 104, "2016": 106, "2017": 91, "2018": 89, "2019": 57, "2020": 58, "2021": 67, "2022": 42, "2023": 17}}
