A series of different monomers, including acrylamides, acrylates, and vinyl acetate, were polymerized to high conversions (between 80 and 100%) at temperatures between 70 and 100 \u00b0C using various initiators, solvents, and RAFT agents. Low dispersities, typically between 1.15\u22121.20, and average molecular weights similar to those of batch RAFT polymerizations were obtained. The methodology provides a facile, alternative scale-up route to conventional batch polymerization, which can be challenging because of the oxygen-sensitive nature of the RAFT process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 135, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2291734116221062610", "cites_id": ["2291734116221062610"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/op1003314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0g0AXQngzR8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 15, "2013": 11, "2014": 17, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 16, "2018": 6, "2019": 13, "2020": 16, "2021": 11, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
