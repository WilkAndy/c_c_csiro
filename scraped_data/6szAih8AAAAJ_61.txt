We found that a method, which involves heating the polymer with a large excess (20 molar equivalents) of azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), while successful with methacrylic polymers, is less effective with styrenic or acrylic polymers and provides only partial end group removal. This is attributed to the propagating radicals generated from the latter polymers being poor radical leaving groups relative to the cyanoisopropyl radical. Similar use of lauroyl peroxide (LPO) completely removes the thiocarbonylthio groups from styrenic or acrylic polymers but, even with LPO in large excess, produces a polymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution. The formation of a peak of double molecular weight is indicative of the occurrence of self\u2010termination and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6608500878784185492", "cites_id": ["6608500878784185492"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pola.23711", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lMTJMYkctlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 10, "2011": 14, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 12, "2019": 14, "2020": 8, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 1}}
