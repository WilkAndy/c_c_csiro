The process is illustrated with the preparation of a styrene-N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) co-dimer macro-RAFT agent [(CH3)3C(CN)\u2013CH2CH(Ph)\u2013CH2CH(CONHiPr)\u2013SC(S)\u2013S-alkyl] by successive single unit monomer insertions into a cyanoisopropyl trithiocarbonate. Critical factors for success are a high transfer constant for the RAFT agent and a high rate of addition of the radical (R\u00b7) to monomer relative to further propagation. With these conditions satisfied, the rate of reaction is largely determined by the rate of R\u00b7 adding to monomer. Initiator-derived by-products (Z\u2013C(S)S\u2013(M)\u2013I) become an issue when R\u00b7 is different from the initiator-derived radical (I\u00b7)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9551196623649234989", "cites_id": ["9551196623649234989"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2012/py/c2py00529h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LeCFjLmqjIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 10, "2016": 14, "2017": 10, "2018": 17, "2019": 19, "2020": 7, "2021": 14, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
