The importance of understanding the kinetics, specificity and efficiency of initiation and chain transfer when predicting polymerization kinetics and polymer composition is highlighted. These factors are particularly important when making low molecular weight polymers and in living or controlled polymerization processes. Examples of RAFT polymerization and catalytic chain transfer are provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8851517296396766841", "cites_id": ["8851517296396766841"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1521-3900(200206)182:1%3C65::AID-MASY65%3E3.0.CO;2-E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eY70bhXo1noJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 11, "2004": 6, "2005": 14, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
