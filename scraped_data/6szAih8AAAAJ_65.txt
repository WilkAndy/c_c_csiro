This provides, for the first time, a direct measure of the amounts of initiation by head and tail addition of benzoyloxy radical to styrene as well as a means of determining the extent of transfer to benzoyl peroxide and primary radical termination. For example, polystyrene prepared by bulk polymerization at 60 C using 0.04 M benzoyl peroxide contains ca. 1.7 benzoate end groups per molecule, 87% of which derive frominitiation by tail addition to styrene, 5% by head addition, and 8% by termination through transfer to initiator or primary radical termination. The method also shows the dependence of these processes on reaction conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14781566786774311245", "cites_id": ["14781566786774311245"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00232a045", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TSFlLa2sIs0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 5, "1985": 5, "1986": 6, "1987": 4, "1988": 7, "1989": 7, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
