Kinetic simulation is used to examine relationships between reaction conditions, the significance of various side reactions, and the evolution of molecular the weight distribution. Expressions used to calculate molecular weights and polydispersities for the various mechanisms are reportedAlkoxyamine-initiated polymerizations of methacrylate esters give only low conversions (10-40%, dependent on particular nitroxide and reaction conditions). Polymerization ceases due to a build up in the nitroxide concentration and the initially formed alkoxyamine is ultimately converted to an unsaturated macromonomer. The conversion, molecular weight and polydispersity are determined by the rate and equilibrium constants and combination:disproportionation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=118494705187748188,2637349020295217919,7570558970975428794", "cites_id": ["118494705187748188", "2637349020295217919", "7570558970975428794"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1998-0685.ch021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XPl6ek76pAEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 7, "2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
