The effect of substituents \u03b1 to the nitroxide nitrogen and at the transannular nitrogen on the outcome of polymerization is explored. Appropriate selection of these substituents provides polymers of lower polydispersities than, for example, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-2-oxyl and derivatives. The nitroxides are synthesized from readily available precursors by a simple \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4957712470193894297", "cites_id": ["4957712470193894297"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma9904868", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mXNufDlVzUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 11, "2002": 11, "2003": 10, "2004": 7, "2005": 7, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
