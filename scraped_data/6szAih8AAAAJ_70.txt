For polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), tertiary cyanoalkyl trithiocarbonates provide very good control over molecular weight and distribution and polymerizations show little retardation. The secondary trithiocarbonate RAFT agents with R\u2009=\u2009CHPh(CN) also gives good control but an inhibition period attributed to slow reinitiation is manifest. Radical induced reduction with hypophosphite salts provides a clean and convenient process for removal of thiocarbonylthio end groups of RAFT\u2010synthesized polymers. Two methods providing simultaneous control over stereochemistry and molecular weight distribution of chains formed by radical polymerization are reported. Polymerization of MMA in the presence of scandium triflate provides a more isotactic PMMA.
