The proceSS utilizes novel Sulfur based chain transfer agents and is widely compatible over a range of monomers and reaction conditions. Novel polymers having low polydispersity and predictably Specific polymer architecture and molecular weight are produced by the process. The polymers produced by the process are"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4942968614756252321,3162793490805668745", "cites_id": ["4942968614756252321", "3162793490805668745"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US6642318/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oXpzIsTzmEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 9, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 4, "2013": 16, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
