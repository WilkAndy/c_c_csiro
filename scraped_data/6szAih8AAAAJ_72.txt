Forlow-conversion polymers the only initiator fragments present are those incorporatedduring the initiation step (ie, by tail addition to monomer). Contrary to some recent reports, primary radical termination and transfer to initiator were found to be of little importance in AIBN-initiated styrene polymerization. These processes account for less than 2% of end groups in low-conversion (8%) polymers prepared inbulk with initiator concentrations in the range 0.01-0.2 M. In high-conversion (85%) polymers prepared with a high (0.2 M) initiator concentration the copolymerization of methacrylonitrile formed from the initiator can be detected."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6480879034521032759", "cites_id": ["6480879034521032759"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00135a021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NxjnDCW18FkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 5, "1986": 4, "1987": 6, "1988": 4, "1989": 3, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 8, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 7, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
