To reproduce such structurally perfect polymers and understand the mechanism of specific functions through chemical approaches, researchers have proposed using synthetic polymers as an alternative due to their broad chemical diversity and relatively simple manipulation. Herein, we report a new methodology to prepare sequence-controlled and stereospecific oligomers using alternating radical chain growth and sequential photoinduced RAFT single unit monomer insertion (photo-RAFT SUMI). Two families of cyclic monomers, the indenes and the N-substituted maleimides, can be alternatively inserted into RAFT agents, one unit at a time, allowing the monomer sequence to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:60iIaj97TE0C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5047167359939239913", "cites_id": ["5047167359939239913"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.8b08386", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6d8fC_kjC0YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 19, "2020": 28, "2021": 18, "2022": 25, "2023": 15}}
