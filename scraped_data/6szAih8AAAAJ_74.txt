The only type of end group observed is that formed by the normal initiation reaction (tail addition to styrene). End groups as might be formed by primary radical termination are either not formed or amount to less than 2% of normal end groups even when high initiator concentrations are employed and the polymerization is taken to high conversion. We also showed that at high conversions significant amounts of methacrylonitrile, formed from the initiator, may be incorporated into the polymer'). As well as yielding valuable information regarding the nature of the initiator residues in polystyrene, our work') raised a number of questions regarding styrene polymerization that could not be answered by examining published kinetic data.
