Under these conditions ring opening is irreversible and in the rigid bicyclic system (4) is under stereoelectronic control. For ring opening of cyclobutylcarbinyl radical (8)kf= 4.3 \u00d7 103 s\u20131 at 60\u00b0, and the best values of the activation parameters appear to be \u0394H\u2021= 12.2 kcal mol\u20131 and \u0394S\u2021=\u20137.4 cal mol\u20131 K1. Monocyclic systems undergo preferential fission of the more substituted \u03b2\u03b3-bond. Methyl substituents at the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, or \u03b4-positions have little effect but \u03b3-substitution strongly enhances the rate of ring opening. The transition state is reactant-like and has a similar disposition of centres to that (1) for homolytic addition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=367140411286928606", "cites_id": ["367140411286928606"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1980/p2/p29800001083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3rxyRUJYGAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 4, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 6, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
