J. Chem. 2005, 58, 379). The first update was published in November 2006 (Aust. J. Chem. 2006, 59, 669) and the second in December 2009 (Aust. J. Chem. 2009, 62, 1402). This review cites over 700 publications that appeared during the period mid 2009 to early 2012 covering various aspects of RAFT polymerization which include reagent synthesis and properties, kinetics and mechanism of polymerization, novel polymer syntheses, and a diverse range of applications. This period has witnessed further significant developments, particularly in the areas of novel RAFT agents, techniques for end-group transformation, the production of micro \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 1072, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=367727665472937990", "cites_id": ["367727665472937990"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH12295", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BiCZCl1uGgUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 65, "2014": 99, "2015": 113, "2016": 126, "2017": 128, "2018": 104, "2019": 110, "2020": 109, "2021": 105, "2022": 78, "2023": 23}}
