We give specific attention to differences between RAFT and conventional processes, differences between RAFT and other forms of reversible deactivation radical polymerization (such as atom transfer radical and nitroxide\u2010mediated polymerizations) and the dependence of the polymerization process and network properties on RAFT agent structure. This knowledge is important in network optimization for applications as dynamic covalent polymers (in self\u2010healing polymers), as porous polymer monoliths or gels (used as chromatographic media, flow reactors, controlled release media, drug delivery vehicles and in molecular imprinting) and as coatings. \u00a9 2014 Society of Chemical Industry"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:J3LtWjKFLicC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14247343351522442649", "cites_id": ["14247343351522442649"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pi.4767", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mb2E5Eq7uMUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 13, "2021": 14, "2022": 16, "2023": 9}}
