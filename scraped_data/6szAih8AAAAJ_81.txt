Oligomers containing a head-to-head linkage were found to be the least thermally stable, degrading at temperatures around 190\u00b0C. In comparison, oligomers containing unsaturated end groups degrade at 255\u00b0C, while models containing saturated terminal units are relatively stable and only degrade at temperatures in excess of 300\u00b0C."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16834924402540625726", "cites_id": ["16834924402540625726"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00254268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Pj_9gYyqoekJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 5, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 5, "1996": 8, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
