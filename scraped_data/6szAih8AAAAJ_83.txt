In this paper aspects of the kinetics and mechanism of RAFT polymerization are discussed with a view to pointing out some of the advantages and limitations of various RAFT agents and providing some guidance on how to select a RAFT agent for a particular polymerization. Factors discussed include: transfer constants (Ctr, C-tr) of RAFT agents-(measurement, substituent effects, prediction with MO calculations, reversibility), retardation (examples, dependence on RAFT agent and monomer, possible mechanisms) and formation of multimodal distributions(examples, contributing mechanisms)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3224855569709099151,14966514112644499038", "cites_id": ["3224855569709099151", "14966514112644499038"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roshan-Mayadunne/publication/267214127_Kinetics_and_Mechanism_of_RAFT_polymerization/links/54aa15f50cf2eecc56e6c9c8/Kinetics-and-Mechanism-of-RAFT-polymerization.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j2hz_A39wCwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 7, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
