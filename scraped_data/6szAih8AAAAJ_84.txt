This analysis demonstrates that the addition of poly(methyl methacrylyl ) radical to methyl methacrylate in benzene at 60\u00b0C is subject to a significant penpenultimate unit effect. The probability of forming a meso dyad is some 20% less if the preceding dyad in the chain is also meso . The polymerization (60\u00b0C, benzene) is described by the following parameters P(m) = 0.202, P(m|m) = 0.159, P(r | m) = 0.212."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14617642831742771682", "cites_id": ["14617642831742771682"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH9860043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4iGQN7VM3MoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 0, "1993": 5, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 1, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
