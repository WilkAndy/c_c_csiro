The data demonstrate that tert-butoxy radicals show electrophilic character (p=-0.30). An explanation for the apparently anomalous behavior shown by tert-butoxy radicals intheir reactions with fluoro olefins is proposed in terms of the ability of-fluorine substituentsto stabilize the incipient C-0 bond.Tedder\u2019s \u201crules\u201d 1 3for radical addition reactions indicate that, while regiospecificity is controlled mainly by steric factors, the rate of radical addition to the unsubstituted terminus of 1-substituted or 1, 1-disubstituted olefins is determined largely by polar factors. This is in accordance with the findingthat trends in the reactivities of radicals toward monomers can often be rationalized in terms of the nucleophilic (eg methyl, 1 n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, ferf-butyl2, 3) or electrophilic (eg trifluoromethyl, 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6338751061083150860", "cites_id": ["6338751061083150860"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo00268a022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DNp9g4HE91cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 4, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 9, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
