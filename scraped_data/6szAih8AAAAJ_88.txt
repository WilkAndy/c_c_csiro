This method is applicable to broad range of monomer families (monosubstituted vinyl monomers) and allows for the preparation of the corresponding single monomer insertion product in high yields (typically >90%; isolated yields after chromatography 60\u201380%). The fidelity of the end-functional SUMI products is demonstrated with use of the SUMI products in RAFT polymerization and by using the tools of conventional chemistry (thiol\u2013ene and esterification reactions). A uniform oligomer comprising five discrete vinyl monomer repeat units was synthesized by an iterative strategy comprising three consecutive SUMI reactions and two intermediate esterification and thiol\u2013ene steps. We thus demonstrate a new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:tz746QTLzJkC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10542997975999314107", "cites_id": ["10542997975999314107"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/sc/c7py00713b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u_gZy8xAUJIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 15, "2019": 19, "2020": 14, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 7}}
