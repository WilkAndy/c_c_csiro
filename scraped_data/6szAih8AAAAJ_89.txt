Thus we have a set of tools that allow unprecedented control over the process and the polymer product while retaining much of the versatility of conventional radical polymerization. Radical polymerization with reversible addition\u2013fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) is foremost among these tools."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7023979449556021526", "cites_id": ["7023979449556021526"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH06376", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FjFuQBgwemEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 11, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
