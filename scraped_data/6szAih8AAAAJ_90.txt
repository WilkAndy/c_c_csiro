These are among the most versatile RAFT agents. Through choice of substituents on nitrogen (Z\u2032, Z\u2033), the polymerization of most monomer types can be controlled to provide living characteristics (i.e., low dispersities, high end\u2010group fidelity, and access to complex architectures). These include the more activated monomers (MAMs; e.g., styrenes and acrylates) and the less activated monomers (LAMs; e.g., vinyl esters and vinylamides). Dithiocarbamates with balanced activity (e.g., 1H\u2010pyrazole\u20101\u2010carbodithioates) or switchable RAFT agents [e.g., a N\u2010methyl\u2010N\u2010(4\u2010pyridinyl)dithiocarbamate] allow control MAMs and LAMs with a single RAFT agent and provide a pathway to low\u2010dispersity poly(MAM)\u2010block \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:3lUAU8Oskd0C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10360887184439887393", "cites_id": ["10360887184439887393"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pola.29199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IcZv-v9DyY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 17, "2021": 23, "2022": 20, "2023": 4}}
