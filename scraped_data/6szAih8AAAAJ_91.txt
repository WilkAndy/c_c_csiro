This paper briefly reviews the mechanism of radical generation from dialkyldiazenes and provides a critical assessment and recommended values for the decomposition rate coefficients (kd) and efficiencies (f) of those that are commercially available. A critique of the methods that have been used for the determination of these kinetic parameters is also provided. In this review, a focus is placed on initiation of radical polymerization of the more reactive monomers such as methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene at low monomer conversions; where addition of the initiator-derived radicals to monomer is not rate determining (i.e., ki>kp) and, thus, the efficiencies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:xyvS_IvSCKsC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17810032847441705092", "cites_id": ["17810032847441705092"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079670018300753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hDjNXYPyKfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 13, "2020": 17, "2021": 18, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
