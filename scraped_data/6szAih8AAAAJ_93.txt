The compound (2) reacts with a variety of electrophilic reagents (including A'-halosuccinimide, bromine, peroxy acid, and singlet oxygen) to generate the corresponding 4a adduct. These adducts (3-6) are characterized by their spectral properties (and l3C NMR, UV) and analytical data. The aqueous-solution chemistry of the adducts is a function of the nature of the 4a substituent. The bromo and chloro adducts are readily reduced (and the former compound is an active brominating agent), while the hydroxy adduct undergoes a facile decomposition with ruptureof the pyrimidine ring. The compound 2 is a competitive inhibitor of both phe-nylalanine and tyrosine hydroxylases, whereas the 4a adducts (3-6) show no apparent interaction with the enzyme."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4742546811414868166", "cites_id": ["4742546811414868166"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00514a033", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xnALqTLp0EEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 3, "1982": 3, "1983": 6, "1984": 4, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
