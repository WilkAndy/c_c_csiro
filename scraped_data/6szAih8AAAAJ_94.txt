This contribution explores the scope and limitations of this sequential approach for the synthesis of higher order quasi-multiblock copolymers (including copolymer sequences of BAB, CBABC, ABC and ABCD). These syntheses illustrate the utility of this high-throughput approach for the one pot synthesis of functional polymers of increased complexity. Additionally, the use of this experimental technique for method development is highlighted."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3797318335242133455,483038802536618426", "cites_id": ["3797318335242133455", "483038802536618426"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/py/c4py00496e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z18vJ-jIsjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 18, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
