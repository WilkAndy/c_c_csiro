Specifically, the coaddition of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) with pentaerythritol resulted in a gel\u2010free polyester with superior melt strengths and viscosities compared to the addition of PMDA alone. The enhancement in rheological properties were dependent on the relative amounts of dianhydride and polyol with the resultant polyester structurally stable in the melt. These results are consistent with the formation of a hyperbranched polyester with long chain branches. \u00a9 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
