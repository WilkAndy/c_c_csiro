The tacticities observed for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are similar to those observed with scandium triflate in the absence of the RAFT agent. The stability of dithiobenzoate RAFT agents [ZC(S)SR] in the presence of scandium triflate is strongly dependent on both the Z and R substituent. 2-(ethoxycarbonyl)prop-2-yl dithiobenzoate [PhC(S)SC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17973961090479392842", "cites_id": ["17973961090479392842"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma071100t", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Soi3tGFWcPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
