We have previously demonstrated that pH-responsive, endosomolytic polymers can enhance protein antigen delivery to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation pathways thereby augmenting CD8+ T cell responses following immunization. Here, we describe a new family of nanocarriers for protein antigen delivery assembled using architecturally distinct pH-responsive polymers. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was used to synthesize linear, hyperbranched, and core-crosslinked copolymers of 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA) that were subsequently chain extended with a hydrophilic N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) segment copolymerized with thiol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "6szAih8AAAAJ:Wq2b2clWBLsC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4248712027635904954,576064834812906047", "cites_id": ["4248712027635904954", "576064834812906047"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1208/s12248-014-9697-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uvEqGBR19joJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
