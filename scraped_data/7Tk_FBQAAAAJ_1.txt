The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M\uf065. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at 40 Mpc~) less than 11 hours after the merger by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC", "num_citations": 3124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2461611103499596342,8818983104342916883,13628307613134185291,2686191015853739501", "cites_id": ["2461611103499596342", "8818983104342916883", "13628307613134185291", "2686191015853739501"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa91c9/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NjJAp0FmKSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 48, "2018": 536, "2019": 633, "2020": 584, "2021": 540, "2022": 526, "2023": 236}}
