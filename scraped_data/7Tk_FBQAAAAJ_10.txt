Most of the key science for the SKA will be addressed through large-area imaging of the Universe at frequencies from a few hundred MHz to a few GHz. The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is a technology demonstrator aimed in the mid-frequency range, and achieves instantaneous wide-area imaging through the development and deployment of phased-array feed systems on parabolic reflectors. The large field-of-view makes ASKAP an unprecedented synoptic telescope that will make substantial advances in SKA key science. ASKAP will be located at the Murchison Radio Observatory in inland Western Australia, one of the most radio-quiet locations on the Earth and one of two sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 346, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11880244244253911648,5300168008249440674", "cites_id": ["11880244244253911648", "5300168008249440674"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/science-with-the-australian-square-kilometre-array-pathfinder/26728F712964AAA62DB572864C8AEC65", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YCqiJzIb36QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 12, "2009": 17, "2010": 21, "2011": 28, "2012": 20, "2013": 17, "2014": 9, "2015": 27, "2016": 18, "2017": 25, "2018": 26, "2019": 25, "2020": 26, "2021": 31, "2022": 32, "2023": 12}}
