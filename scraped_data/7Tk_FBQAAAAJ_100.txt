Of particular importance is how pulsars evolve through the P\u2013 diagram with time. Here we show that the decay of the inclination angle () between the magnetic and rotation axes plays a critical role. In particular,  strongly impacts on the braking torque, an effect that has been largely ignored in previous work. We carry out simulations that include a negative  term, and show that it is possible to reproduce the observational P\u2013 diagram without the need for either pulsars with long birth periods or magnetic field decay. Our best model indicates a birth rate of one radio pulsar per century and a total Galactic population of \u223c20 000 pulsars beaming towards Earth."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3481832127455534997", "cites_id": ["3481832127455534997"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/467/3/3493/3002588", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lZ-HVN_zUTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 22, "2020": 22, "2021": 13, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
