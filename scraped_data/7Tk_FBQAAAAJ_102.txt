AGILE detected three new top-ranking nearby and Vela-like pulsars with good confidence both through timing and spatial analysis. Among the newcomers we find pulsars with very high rotational energy losses, such as the remarkable PSR B1509\u2212 58 with a magnetic field in excess of 10 13 Gauss, and PSR J2229+ 6114 providing a reliable identification for the previously unidentified EGRET source 3EG 2227+ 6122. Moreover, the powerful millisecond pulsar B1821\u2212 24, in the globular cluster M28, is detected during a fraction of the observations.
