This pulsar is located in the 8 diameter Vela supernova remnant, which contains several regions of non-thermal emission detected in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. The gamma-ray emission detected by the LAT lies within one of these regions, the 2\u00d7 3 area south of the pulsar known as Vela-X. The LAT flux is significantly spatially extended with a best-fit radius of 0 fdg 88\u00b10 fdg 12 for an assumed radially symmetric uniform disk. The 200 MeV to 20 GeV LAT spectrum of this source is well described by a power law with a spectral index of 2.41\u00b10.09\u00b10.15 and integral flux above 100 MeV of (4.73\u00b10.63\u00b11.32)\u00d7 10\u2212 7 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1.
