Contrast is made between the convention that has been widely accepted by pulsar astronomers and the IAU/IEEE definitions of the Stokes parameters. The former is adopted as the PSR/IEEE convention, and a set of useful parameters are presented for describing the differences between the PSR/IEEE standard and the conventions (either implicit or explicit) that form part of the design of observatory instrumentation. To aid in the empirical determination of instrumental convention parameters, well-calibrated average polarisation profiles of PSR J0304+1932 and PSR J0742\u20132822 are presented at radio wavelengths of approximately 10, 20, and 40 cm."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9094031326351201433", "cites_id": ["9094031326351201433"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/psrchive-and-psrfits-definition-of-the-stokes-parameters-and-instrumental-basis-conventions/197BF11EA098E41ED3541E40DEB86A9F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mRRwH099NH4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 12, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 17, "2022": 23, "2023": 7}}
