After one year of observation the LAT detected and identified three PWNe: the Crab Nebula, Vela-X, and the PWN inside MSH 15\u201352. In the meantime, the list of LAT detected pulsars increased steadily. These pulsars are characterized by high energy loss rates () from\u223c 3\u00d7 10 33 erg s\u2212 1 to 5\u00d7 10 38 erg s\u2212 1 and are therefore likely to power a PWN. This paper summarizes the search for PWNe in the off-pulse windows of 54 LAT-detected pulsars using 16 months of survey observations. Ten sources show significant emission, seven of these likely being of magnetospheric origin. The detection of significant emission in the off-pulse interval offers new constraints on the \u03b3-ray emitting regions in pulsar magnetospheres.
