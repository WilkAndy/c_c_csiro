All the pulsars have spin periods greater than 100 ms, and none of those with timing solutions is in binaries. Two display particularly interesting behaviour; PSR J1054\u22125944 is found to be an intermittent pulsar, and PSR J1809\u22120119 has glitched twice since its discovery.In the second half of the paper we discuss the development and application of an artificial neural network in the data-processing pipeline for the survey. We discuss the tests that were used to generate scores and find that our neural network was able to reject over 99 per cent of the candidates produced in the data processing, and able to blindly detect 85 per cent of pulsars. We suggest that improvements to the accuracy should be possible if further care is taken when training an artificial neural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12729422201662093954", "cites_id": ["12729422201662093954"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/427/2/1052/975017", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gjoKjgz-p7AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 18, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
