The vast majority of these pulsars have spin-down luminosities in excess of 1034 erg s\u22121 and are prime target candidates to be detected in gamma-rays by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We provide the ephemerides for the ten pulsars being timed at Parkes which have been detected by Fermi in its first year of operation. These ephemerides, in conjunction with the publicly available photonlist, can be used to generate gamma-ray profiles from the Fermi archive. We will make the ephemerides of any pulsars of interest available to the community upon request. In addition to the timing ephemerides, we present the parameters for 14 glitches which have occurred in 13 pulsars, seven of which have no previously known glitch history.The Parkes timing programme, in conjunction with Fermi observations, is expected to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3516682961548086098", "cites_id": ["3516682961548086098"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/pulsar-timing-with-the-parkes-radio-telescope-for-the-fermi-mission/3A54DB3C65D0C233257499A393BABD49", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ugu-doXEzTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 8, "2011": 13, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 3}}
