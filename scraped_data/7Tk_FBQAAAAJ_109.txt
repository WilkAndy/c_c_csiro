If the progenitors of FRBs are non-cataclysmic, such as giant pulses from pulsars, pulsar\u2013planet binaries, or magnetar flares, FRB emission may be seen to repeat. We have undertaken a survey of the fields of eight known FRBs from the High Time Resolution Universe survey to search for repeating pulses. Although no repeat pulses were detected the survey yielded the detection of a new FRB, described in Petroff et al. . From our observations we rule out periodic repeating sources with periods P \u2264 8.6 h and rule out sources with periods 8.6 < P < 21 h at the 90\u2009per\u2009cent confidence level. At P \u2265 21 h our limits fall off as \u223c1/P. Dedicated and persistent observations of FRB source fields are needed to rule out repetition on longer time-scales, a task well-suited to next generation wide-field \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4154556032443417691", "cites_id": ["4154556032443417691"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/454/1/457/1130397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WwQ_IbPypzkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 16, "2017": 19, "2018": 14, "2019": 18, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
