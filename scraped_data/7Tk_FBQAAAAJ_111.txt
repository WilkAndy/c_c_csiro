In addition, we analyzed archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and XMM-Newton X-ray data for the two MSPs, confirming the X-ray emission properties of PSR B1937+ 21 and finding evidence (\u223c 4\u03c3) for pulsed emission from PSR B1957+ 20 for the first time. In both cases the gamma-ray emission profile is characterized by two peaks separated by half a rotation and are in close alignment with components observed in radio and X-rays. These two pulsars join PSRs J0034\u2212 0534 and J2214+ 3000 to form an emerging class of gamma-ray MSPs with phase-aligned \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7124883641125851735", "cites_id": ["7124883641125851735"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/744/1/33/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V1JMH-yr4GIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 12, "2013": 20, "2014": 12, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
