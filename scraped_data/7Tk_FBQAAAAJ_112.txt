We find micro-structure in about 80 per cent of all pulses independent of observing frequency. The width of a micro-pulse seems to depend on its peak flux density, whilst quasi-periodicities observed in micro-pulses remain constant. The width of the micro-pulses may decrease with increasing frequency, but confirmation is needed at higher frequencies. The fraction of pulses showing quasi-periodic micro-pulses may become smaller at higher frequencies. We show that the micro-pulse width in pulsars has a period dependence which suggests a model of sweeping micro-beams as the origin of the micro-pulses.Like individual pulses, the micro-pulses of Vela are highly elliptically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11785563236955189599", "cites_id": ["11785563236955189599"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/334/3/523/1424495", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X_GdSFK7jqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 11, "2004": 10, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 9, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
