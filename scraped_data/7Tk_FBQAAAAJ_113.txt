To date, 10 objects have been proposed, and one, Geminga, has been confirmed as a pulsar by the detection of 4.2-Hz pulsations. Several indicators have been used to support the proposition that the X-ray sources are isolated neutron stars, including high X-ray to optical/radio flux ratios, a constant X-ray flux and coincidence with a \u03b3-ray source. Seven of the published neutron star candidates are located near the centres of supernova remnants, two of them within plerions, suggesting that these are young objects (\u03c4 < 20 000 yr). The remaining candidate neutron stars have no associated supernova remnant and may be older systems, powered either by their rotation, like Geminga, or possibly by accretion from the interstellar medium.Quantitative upper limits exist for the radio fluxes of eight \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8758983281800077729", "cites_id": ["8758983281800077729"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/305/3/671/983417", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oWFHQeMojnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 9, "2001": 16, "2002": 11, "2003": 11, "2004": 9, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
