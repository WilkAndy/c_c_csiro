Timing observations of this pulsar, made over a 7-yr period using the Parkes 64-m radio telescope, cover two periastron passages, in 1990 August and 1994 January. The timing data cannot be fitted by the normal pulsar and Keplerian binary parameters. A timing solution including a (non-precessing) Keplerian orbit and timing noise (represented as a polynomial of fifth order in time) provides a satisfactory fit to the data. However, because the Be star probably has a significant quadrupole moment, we prefer to interpret the data by a combination of timing noise, dominated by a cubic phase term, and \u03c9. and x. terms. We show that the \u03c9. and x. terms are likely to be a result of a precessing orbit caused by the quadrupole moment of the tilted companion star. We further rule out a number of possible physical effects which could \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14739838718583496593", "cites_id": ["14739838718583496593"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/298/4/997/1138967", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kd-3MzhtjswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 7, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 11, "2005": 11, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
