The pulsar's characteristic age of 58,000 yr is consistent with the estimated remnant age, but the large observed dispersion of the pulsar signal is difficult to reconcile with the independently estimated remnant distance. PSR B1758-23 has glitched three times during our observations, in keeping with the trend of high glitch activity in younger pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10819365178343159472", "cites_id": ["10819365178343159472"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993ApJ...409L..57K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sPZfZk4bJpYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 9, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 7, "2000": 9, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
