Down to a detection threshold of 0.285 Jy, no transient candidates were identified, making this the most constraining low-frequency survey to date and placing a limit on the surface density of transients of <4.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 deg\u22122 for the shortest time-scale considered. At these frequencies, emission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is expected to be detectable in the shortest time-scale images without any corrections for interstellar or intergalactic dispersion. At an FRB limiting flux density of 7980 Jy, we find a rate of <82 FRBs per sky per day for dispersion measures <700 pc cm\u22123. Assuming a cosmological population of standard candles, our rate limits are consistent with the FRB rates obtained by Thornton et al. if they have a flat spectral slope. Finally, we conduct an initial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6900454349690935160", "cites_id": ["6900454349690935160"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/458/4/3506/2613802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eJcgvqtWw18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 16, "2018": 14, "2019": 19, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
