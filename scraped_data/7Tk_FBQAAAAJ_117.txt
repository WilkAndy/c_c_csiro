Although these six pulsars are diverse in terms of their spin parameters, they share an important feature: their \u03b3-ray light curves are (at least given the current count statistics) single peaked. For two pulsars, there are hints for a double-peaked structure in the light curves. The shapes of the observed light curves of this group of pulsars are discussed in the light of models for which the emission originates from high up in the magnetosphere. The observed phases of the \u03b3-ray light curves are, in general, consistent with those predicted by high-altitude models, although we speculate that the \u03b3-ray emission of PSR J0659+ 1414, possibly featuring the softest spectrum of all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11197166722986791331", "cites_id": ["11197166722986791331"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/708/2/1426/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o9FzNs9TZJsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 14, "2011": 16, "2012": 6, "2013": 11, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
