The data span encompasses four complete orbits and includes the periastron passages in 1990, 1994, 1997 and 2000. Changes in dispersion measure occurring around the 1994, 1997 and 2000 periastrons are measured and accounted for in the timing analysis. There is good evidence for a small glitch in the pulsar period in 1997 August, not long after the 1997 periastron, and a significant frequency second derivative indicating timing noise. We find that spin\u2013orbit coupling with secular changes in periastron longitude and projected semimajor axis (x) cannot account for the observed period variations over the whole data set. While fitting the data fairly well, changes in pulsar period parameters at each periastron seem ruled out both by X-ray observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5950598419308844844", "cites_id": ["5950598419308844844"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/351/2/599/1025834", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LJfnF7zFlFIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 10, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
