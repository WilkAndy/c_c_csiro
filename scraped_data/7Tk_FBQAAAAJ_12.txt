The Parkes 64-m radio telescope was used at a central observing frequency of 1500 MHz to survey an area of 800 square degrees in the region  To ensure that the system retained good sensitivity to periods of less than 10 ms, we used sampling intervals of 0.3 and 1.2 ms. The survey detected a total of 100 pulsars, 46 of which were previously unknown. The periods of the newly discovered pulsars range between 47 ms and 2.5 s. One of the new discoveries, PSR 1259 \u2013 63, is a member of a long-period binary system. At least three of the pulsars have ages less than 30 000 yr, bringing the total number of such pulsars to 12. PSR 1112 \u2013 60 is probably embedded in the powerful H II region RCW 57. The majority of the new discoveries are distant objects with high dispersion measures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 337, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9788547647716195691", "cites_id": ["9788547647716195691"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/255/3/401/1022082", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a_0bQTno14cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 7, "1994": 10, "1995": 16, "1996": 20, "1997": 11, "1998": 20, "1999": 13, "2000": 16, "2001": 18, "2002": 11, "2003": 9, "2004": 16, "2005": 11, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 14, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 11, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
