Both PSRs J1745\u20132912 and J1746\u20132856 have an angular separation from the Galactic Centre of less than  and dispersion measures in excess of 1100 cm\u22123 pc, placing them in the top 10 pulsars when ranked on this value. The frequency dependence of the scatter-broadening in PSR J1746\u20132856 is much shallower than expected from simple theory. We believe it likely that the pulsars are located between 150 and 500 pc from the Galactic Centre on the near side, and are part of an excess population of neutron stars associated with the Centre itself. A second survey made at 8.4 GHz did not detect any pulsars. This implies either that there are not many bright, long-period pulsars at the Galactic Centre or that the scattering is more severe at high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14113415548216095245", "cites_id": ["14113415548216095245"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/373/1/L6/988984", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DTLlPqrs3MMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
