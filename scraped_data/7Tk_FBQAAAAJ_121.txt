This pulsar was discovered at X-ray wavelengths and subsequently detected in the optical band. It has a mean flux density of only 0.4 mJy and a broad pulse profile, similar to that at optical and X-ray wavelengths. The dispersion measure of 146/cu cm pc is somewhat higher than, but not inconsistent with, that for other pulsars located in the Magellanic Clouds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4896210366825577847", "cites_id": ["4896210366825577847"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993ApJ...403L..29M", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dz05LGPV8kMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 9, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
