Recent work by Thornton et al. has revealed a population of FRBs in the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) survey at high Galactic latitudes. A variety of progenitors have been proposed, including cataclysmic events at cosmological distances, Galactic flare stars, and terrestrial radio frequency interference. Here we report on a search for FRBs at intermediate Galactic latitudes (\u2212 15< b< 15) in data taken as part of the HTRU survey. No FRBs were discovered in this region. Several effects such as dispersion, scattering, sky temperature, and scintillation decrease the sensitivity by more than 3\u03c3 in\u223c 20% of survey pointings. Including all of these effects, we exclude the hypothesis that FRBs are uniformly distributed on the sky with 99% confidence. This low probability implies that additional factors\u2014not accounted for by standard \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11828189031999632764", "cites_id": ["11828189031999632764"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/789/2/L26/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fHWClEErJqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 12, "2016": 19, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 13, "2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 7}}
