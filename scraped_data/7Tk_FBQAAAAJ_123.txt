We show that although its flux density is varying up to a factor of \u223c10 within a few days, it has on average decreased by a factor of 2 over the last 700 days. At the same time, timing analysis indicates a trend of decreasing spin-down rate over our entire data set, again of about a factor of 2 over 700 days, but also an erratic variability in the spin-down rate within this time span. Integrated pulse profiles are often close to 100\u2003per\u2003cent linearly polarized, but large variations in both the profile shape and fractional polarization are regularly observed. Furthermore, the behaviour of the position angle of the linear polarization is very complex \u2013 offsets in both the absolute position angle and the phase of the position angle sweep are often seen and the occasional presence of orthogonal mode jumps further \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13704214864413116877", "cites_id": ["13704214864413116877"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/422/3/2489/1047005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zcn4ps8mL74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 14, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
