The source appears 22 d before periastron and lasts for more than 100 d. Over most of the event the spectral index is \u223c-0.5, indicating an optically thin synchrotron source. The peak flux of \u223c50 mJy at 1 GHz occurs about 20 d after periastron. There are strong similarities in the light curves of the 1994 and 1997 periastron passages. The radio light curve shows day-to-day variability and varies by a factor of more than 100 over the observation interval. This is in contrast to the X-ray emission which varies by only a factor of 2 close to periastron. The emission is interpreted as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2291120255772654841", "cites_id": ["2291120255772654841"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/302/2/277/968354", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-fwH17uxyx8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
