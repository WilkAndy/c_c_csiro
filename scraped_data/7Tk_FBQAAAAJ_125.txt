We constructed a phase-coherent ephemeris, with post-fit residual rms of 3 \u03bcs, using radio data spanning\u223c 23.2 yr, enabling measurements of the multi-wavelength light-curve properties of PSR B1821\u2212 24 at the milliperiod level. We fold RXTE observations of PSR B1821\u2212 24 from 1996 to 2007 and discuss implications on the emission zones. The gamma-ray light curve consists of two peaks separated by 0.41\u00b10.02 in phase, with the first gamma-ray peak lagging behind the first radio peak by 0.05\u00b10.02 in phase, consistent with the phase of giant radio pulses. We observe significant emission in the off-peak interval of PSR B1821\u2212 24 with a best-fit LAT position inconsistent with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14479918425469708422", "cites_id": ["14479918425469708422"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/778/2/106/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hmjBDhcB88gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 13, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 14, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
