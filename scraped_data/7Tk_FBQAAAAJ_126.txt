Correcting for effects caused by the interstellar medium, we derive intrinsic flux density spectra of individual radio pulses observed at several frequencies for the first time. Pulsar B0329+54 was observed at 238, 626, 1412 and 4850 MHz, while observations of PSR B1133+16 were made at 341, 626, 1412 and 4850 MHz. We derive intrinsic pulse-to-pulse modulation indices which show a minimum around 1 GHz. Correlations between the flux densities of different frequency pairs worsen as the frequency separation widens and also tend to be worse for outer profile components.
