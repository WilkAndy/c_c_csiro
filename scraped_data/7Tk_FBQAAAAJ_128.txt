Its \u03b3-ray luminosity, L\u03b3 = (8.4 \u00b1 1.6) \u00d7 1034 ergs per second, is the highest observed for any millisecond pulsar (MSP) to date, and it accounts for most of the cluster emission. The nondetection of the cluster in the off-pulse phase implies that it contains <32 \u03b3-ray MSPs, not \u223c100 as previously estimated. The \u03b3-ray luminosity indicates that the unusually large rate of change of its period is caused by its intrinsic spin-down. This implies that J1823\u20133021A has the largest magnetic field and is the youngest MSP ever detected and that such anomalous objects might be forming at rates comparable to those of the more normal MSPs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11177033996348430528", "cites_id": ["11177033996348430528"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1207141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wBjQgjPNHJsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 9, "2013": 14, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
