Half are neutron stars discovered using LAT data through periodicity searches in gamma-ray and radio data around LAT unassociated source positions. The 117 pulsars are evenly divided into three groups: millisecond pulsars, young radio-loud pulsars, and young radio-quiet pulsars. We characterize the pulse profiles and energy spectra and derive luminosities when distance information exists. Spectral analysis of the off-peak phase intervals indicates probable pulsar wind nebula emission for four pulsars, and off-peak magnetospheric emission for several young and millisecond pulsars. We compare the gammaray properties with those in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. We provide flux limits for pulsars with no observed gamma-ray \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 333, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7698196555385641700", "cites_id": ["7698196555385641700"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/208/2/17/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5Jrl9vp81WoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 33, "2015": 47, "2016": 43, "2017": 46, "2018": 41, "2019": 26, "2020": 26, "2021": 29, "2022": 29, "2023": 9}}
