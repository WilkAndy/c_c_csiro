Although this value is larger by 0.07 than that reported by Kawai et al., the difference is not statistically significant only2 sigma when account is taken of the uncertainty associated with their result. We briefly discuss the possibility that the energy-independence of the gamma-ray pulse phase is a signature of non-thermal radiation in the X-raygamma-ray range and the suggestion of a dependence of pulsar radio-gamma-ray phase offset on pulse period.Descriptors:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1818523045191269451", "cites_id": ["1818523045191269451"], "pub_url": "https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA461851", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S7x8HBOxPBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 12, "1995": 7, "1996": 2, "1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 9, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1}}
