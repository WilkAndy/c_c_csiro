High-resolution interferometric radio observations establish extended radio emission trailing the position of the pulsar. Observations with the FermiGamma-ray Space Telescope reveal GeV \u03b3-ray flaring activity of the system, reaching the spin-down luminosity of the pulsar, around 30 d after periastron. There are no clear signatures of variability at radio, X-ray and TeV energies at the time of the GeV flare. Variability around periastron in the H\u03b1 emission line, can be interpreted as the gravitational interaction between the pulsar and the circumstellar disc. The equivalent width of the H\u03b1 grows from a few days before periastron until a few days later, and decreases again between 18 and 46 d after periastron. In near-infrared we observe the similar decrease of the equivalent width of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16485672761640638734", "cites_id": ["16485672761640638734"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/439/1/432/1748703", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DlnsKAjgyOQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 7, "2015": 13, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 13, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
