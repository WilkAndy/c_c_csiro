Our model makes use of the scalefactor method, which estimates the ratio of the total number of MSPs in the Galaxy to the known sample. Using our best-fitting value for the z-height, z = 500\u2009pc, we find an underlying population of MSPs of 8.3(\u00b14.2) \u00d7 104 sources down to a limiting luminosity of Lmin = 0.1\u2009mJy\u2009kpc2 and a luminosity distribution with a steep slope of d\u2009log\u2009N/d\u2009log\u2009L = \u22121.45 \u00b1 0.14. However, at the low end of the luminosity distribution, the uncertainties introduced by small number statistics are large. By omitting very low luminosity pulsars, we find a Galactic population above Lmin = 0.2\u2009mJy\u2009kpc2 of only 3.0(\u00b10.7) \u00d7 104 MSPs. We have also simulated pulsars with periods shorter than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7657280541615457863", "cites_id": ["7657280541615457863"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/434/2/1387/1069829", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RwaAJBUgRGoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
