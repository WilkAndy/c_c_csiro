We find that the pulsed emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized. The position angle of linear polarization varies gently across the observed pulse profiles, varying little with observing frequency or time, even as the pulse profiles have changed dramatically over a period of 7 months. In the context of the standard pulsar\" rotating vector model,\" there are two possible interpretations of the observed position angle swing coupled with the wide profile. In the first, the magnetic and rotation axes are substantially misaligned and the emission originates high in the magnetosphere, as seen for other young radio pulsars, and the beaming fraction is large. In the second interpretation, the magnetic and rotation axes are nearly aligned, and the line of sight remains in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=150670320033073121", "cites_id": ["150670320033073121"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/516630/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4QfEl9tJFwIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 8, "2008": 9, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
