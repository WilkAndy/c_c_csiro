The gamma-ray emission detected by the LAT is significantly spatially extended, with a best-fit rms extension of \u03c3= 0 fdg 56\u00b10 fdg 07 for an assumed Gaussian model. The 1\u2013100 GeV LAT spectrum of this source is well described by a power law with a spectral index of 1.38\u00b10.12\u00b10.16 and an integral flux above 1 GeV of (6.50\u00b10.21\u00b13.90)\u00d7 10\u2212 9 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. The first errors represent the statistical errors on the fit parameters, while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties. Detailed morphological and spectral analyses bring new constraints on the energetics and magnetic field of the PWN system. The spatial extent and hard spectrum of the GeV emission are consistent with the picture of an inverse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2446838793235093329", "cites_id": ["2446838793235093329"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/738/1/42/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UVdsJevq9CEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 13, "2013": 16, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
