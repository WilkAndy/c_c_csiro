Using the 711.5\u20131015.5 MHz band of ASKAP we were able to conduct a blind search for the 21-cm line in a continuous redshift range between z = 0.4 and 1.0, which has, until now, remained largely unexplored. The absorption line is detected at z = 0.44 towards the GHz-peaked spectrum radio source PKS B1740\u2212517 and demonstrates ASKAP's excellent capability for performing a future wide-field survey for H\u2009i absorption at these redshifts. Optical spectroscopy and imaging using the Gemini-South telescope indicates that the H\u2009i gas is intrinsic to the host galaxy of the radio source. The narrow [O\u2009iii] emission lines show clear double-peaked structure, indicating either large-scale outflow or rotation of the ionized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15246542358011092559", "cites_id": ["15246542358011092559"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/453/2/1249/1130721", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T54ytn6ZltMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 17, "2017": 18, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
