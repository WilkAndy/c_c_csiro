Observations were carried out at 1.4 GHz using the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array and utilized pulsar-gating to search for off-pulse emission. These observing parameters resulted in a considerably more sensitive search than previous surveys and could detect PWN over a much wider range of spatial scales (and hence ambient densities and pulsar velocities). However, no emission clearly corresponding to a PWN was discovered. Based on these non-detections we argue that the young and energetic pulsars in our sample have winds which are typical of young pulsars, but produce unobservable PWN because they reside in low-density (n\u223c0.003 cm\u22123) regions of the interstellar medium. However, non-detection of PWN around older and less energetic pulsars \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17894414513377060724", "cites_id": ["17894414513377060724"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/318/1/58/1146876", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dCdv9TC7VfgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 12, "2002": 9, "2003": 9, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
