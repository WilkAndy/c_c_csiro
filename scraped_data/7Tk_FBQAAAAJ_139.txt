Following their discovery, regular timing observations at the Parkes radio telescope have been carried out to obtain improved parameters for them. One of these pulsars was found to be in a highly eccentric orbit around a Be star and is reported elsewhere (Johnston et al. 1992b, 1994). We report here on the remaining 45 pulsars. One, PSR J1803-2712, is a member of a binary with a wide, circular orbit and a low mass companion. As in the comparable northern survey by Clifton et al.(1992), a substantial number of the new pulsars have ages less than 10^ 5^ yr. Two of these young pulsars may be associated with supernova remnants and three have glitched within the past three years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3521228205643481685", "cites_id": ["3521228205643481685"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995A%26A...293..795J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VUJ3kmXq3TAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 10, "1997": 2, "1998": 6, "1999": 4, "2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
