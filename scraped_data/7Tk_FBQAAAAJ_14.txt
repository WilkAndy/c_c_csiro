New instrumentation has decreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and enables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have discovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 2014 May 14 at 17:14:11.06 UTC at the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths within hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM) of 562.7(6) cm\u22123 pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of z \u2272 0.5. FRB 140514 was found to be 21 \u00b1 7 per cent (3\u03c3) circularly polarized on the leading edge with a 1\u03c3 upper limit on linear polarization <10 per cent. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the FRB.
