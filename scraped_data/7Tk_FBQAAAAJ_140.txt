Using contemporaneous timing solutions, upper limits on pulsed emission were obtained for 350 pulsars. Limits to unpulsed gamma radiation were obtained for all cataloged pulsars. No new pulsar detections have been found, although there is evidence for localized excesses at the positions of a few of these pulsars. No significant correlation was, however, found between Edot/d 2 and the sources of such unpulsed excesses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13483429191824327037", "cites_id": ["13483429191824327037"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ApJ...465..898N", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fUHSZGnDHrsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 16, "1998": 14, "1999": 8, "2000": 6, "2001": 11, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
