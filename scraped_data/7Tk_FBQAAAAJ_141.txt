Here, we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower radio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could be detectable at redshifts out to about z = 0.5 in surveys below 1\u2009GHz. Using a source model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric luminosities \u223c8 \u00d7 1044\u2009ergs\u2009s\u22121 uniformly distributed per unit comoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as a function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by Thornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and redshift probed by a given survey.
