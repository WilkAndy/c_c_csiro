It is dif\ufb01cult to produce a millisecond pulsar velocity greater than 270 km s \u201c1 with any model, unless the formation of the neutron star is accompanied by some form of asymmetric kick. If the accretion\u2014induced collapse of a white dwarf is the sole for\u2014mation mechanism, then kicks are essential to reproduce the high velocities of some of the millisecond pulsars ob\u2014served. Our computations show that, in general, we expect those systems with shorter orbital periods to have larger velocities than those with longer periods, but any relation between the \ufb01nal orbital period and space velocity is fairly weak, especially if asymmetries are involved. We demon\u2014strate that binary millisecond pulsars probably evolved through a common envelope before the formation of the neutron star, and that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11977978505477376771", "cites_id": ["11977978505477376771"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/320755/files/SCAN-9702124.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A0s-Gv1TOqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 8, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
