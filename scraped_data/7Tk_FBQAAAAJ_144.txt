We also present confirmation of the gamma-ray pulsations from a sixth source, PSR J2051\u22120827. Five of these six MSPs are in binary systems: PSRs J1713+0747, J1741+1351, J1600\u22123053 and the two black widow binary pulsars PSRs J0610\u22122100 and J2051\u22120827. The only isolated MSP is the nearby PSR J1024\u22120719, which is also known to emit X-rays. We present X-ray observations in the direction of PSRs J1600\u22123053 and J2051\u22120827. While PSR J2051\u22120827 is firmly detected, we can only give upper limits for the X-ray flux of PSR J1600\u22123053. There are no dedicated X-ray observations available for the other three objects.The MSPs mentioned above, together with most of the MSPs detected by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3066778460056016327", "cites_id": ["3066778460056016327"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/430/1/571/986155", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x1V1zMJijyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 8, "2014": 10, "2015": 16, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 9}}
