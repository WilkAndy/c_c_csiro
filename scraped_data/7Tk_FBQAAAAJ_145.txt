During the periastron passage the system displays transient non-thermal unpulsed emission from radio to very high energy gamma rays. It is one of the three galactic binary systems clearly detected at TeV energies, together with LS 5039 and LS I+ 61 303. We observed PSR B1259\u2212 63 after the 2007 periastron passage with the Australian Long Baseline Array at 2.3 GHz to trace the milliarcsecond (mas) structure of the source at three different epochs. We have discovered extended and variable radio structure. The peak of the radio emission is detected outside the binary system near periastron, at projected distances of 10\u201320 mas (25\u201345 AU assuming a distance of 2.3 kpc). The total extent of the emission is\u223c 50 mas (\u223c 120 AU). This is the first observational evidence that non-accreting pulsars orbiting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10810598876655461163", "cites_id": ["10810598876655461163"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/732/1/L10/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KyNJvGb2BpYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 19, "2013": 11, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
