The light curve consists of two narrow peaks of similar amplitude separated by 0.468\u00b10.002 in phase. The first peak lags the maximum of the 2 GHz radio pulse by 0.162\u00b10.004\u00b10.01 in phase. The integral gamma-ray photon flux above 100 MeV is (56\u00b13\u00b111)\u00d7 10\u2212 8 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1. The photon spectrum is well described by an exponentially cut-off power law of the form , where the energy E is expressed in GeV. The photon index is \u0393= 1.5\u00b10.1\u00b10.1 and the exponential cut-off is E c= 2.4\u00b10.3\u00b10.5 GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The integral photon flux of the bridge is approximately 10% of the pulsed emission, and the upper limit on off-pulse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16631023331630916471", "cites_id": ["16631023331630916471"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/700/2/1059/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dyMY7ZpDzeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 10, "2010": 16, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
