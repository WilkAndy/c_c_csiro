It is shown that the number of millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy with luminosities similar to PSR 1937 + 21 and PSR 1855 + 09 need not exceed \u223c 60 and \u223c 2500 respectively. These limits are much lower than previous estimates, partly because of an improved distance estimate to 1855 + 09. If all millisecond pulsars have similar luminosities to that of 1855 + 09, then it is possible that all millisecond pulsars evolve from low-mass X-ray binaries. However, only poor constraints can be placed on the populations of very steep spectrum objects like PSR 1957 + 20, and intrinsically low-luminosity pulsars such as PSR 1257 + 12, which could be of order 105 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13958147811511991591", "cites_id": ["13958147811511991591"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/252/2/277/1137138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J32RK3tNtcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 3, "1993": 8, "1994": 6, "1995": 12, "1996": 10, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
