We find a large shell with extended wings, at the edge of which is a nonthermal, polarized structure with a center-filled morphology (the\" Rabbit\"), coincident with an extended, hard X-ray source. We discuss the various sources seen within the ellipse as potential counterparts of the \u03b3-ray source. We conclude that the most likely scenario is that the Rabbit is a wind nebula surrounding a radio-quiet \u03b3-ray pulsar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3286527950848661433", "cites_id": ["3286527950848661433"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/307058/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uRe6LsIXnC0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 11, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
