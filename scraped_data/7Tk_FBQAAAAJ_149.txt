These results confirm the association of this pulsar with the supernova remnant. They also imply that the pulsar was born with such a high velocity that it has overtaken the supernova remnant shell and now lies outside the shell."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17824689448002201466", "cites_id": ["17824689448002201466"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/253/1/7P/1059894", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eifTG50EXvcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 6, "1993": 8, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 7, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 0, "2000": 10, "2001": 6, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 10, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
