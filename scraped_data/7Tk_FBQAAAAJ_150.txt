Using 13 months of LAT data, significant \u03b3-ray pulsations at the radio period have been detected from the MSP PSR J0034\u2212 0534, making it the ninth clear MSP detection by the LAT. The \u03b3-ray light curve shows two peaks separated by 0.274\u00b10.015 in phase which are very nearly aligned with the radio peaks, a phenomenon seen only in the Crab pulsar until now. The\u2a7e 0.1 GeV spectrum of this pulsar is well fit by an exponentially cutoff power law with a cutoff energy of 1.8\u00b10.6\u00b10.1 GeV and a photon index of 1.5\u00b10.2\u00b10.1, first errors are statistical and second are systematic. The near-alignment of the radio and \u03b3-ray peaks strongly suggests that the radio and \u03b3-ray emission regions are co-located and both are the result of caustic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:1DsIQWDZLl8C", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1312954949887866238", "cites_id": ["1312954949887866238"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/712/2/957/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fjUoEpKNOBIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 18, "2011": 18, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
