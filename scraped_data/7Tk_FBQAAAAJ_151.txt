In no cases did we find single pulses with flux densities more than 10 times the mean flux density. However, in PSR B1706\u201344 we have detected giant micro-pulses very similar to those seen in the Vela pulsar. In PSR B1706\u201344 these giant micro-pulses appear on the trailing edge of the profile and have an intrinsic width of \u223c1 ms. The cumulative probability distribution of their intensities is best described by a power law. If the power law continues to higher intensities, then 3.7\u00d7106 rotations are required to obtain a pulse with 20\u00d7 the mean pulse flux. This number is similar to the giant pulse rate in PSR B1937+21 and PSR B1821\u201324 but significantly higher than that for the Crab."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12026523736411666186", "cites_id": ["12026523736411666186"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/332/1/109/974226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cveed57L5qYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 8, "2004": 9, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 9, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
