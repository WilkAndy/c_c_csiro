This 47.7 ms radio pulsar is in a highly eccentric (epsilon approximately 0.85) binary system with the 10-15 solar mass Be star SS 2883. It is the first radio pulsar found to be in a binary system with a massive main-sequence companion; it is also the most highly eccentric binary system known to contain a neutron star. The level of X-ray flux detected in the ROSAT observations has increased with orbital phase by a factor of at least 10 between 1992 February and 1993 February. The X-ray flux is significantly greater than expected from the Be star's corona and seems likely to originate either from low-level stellar wind accretion onto the neutron star or from the shock between the stellar wind and the relativistic pulsar wind.
