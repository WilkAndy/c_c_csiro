Although the timing noise provides insights into nuclear and plasma physics at extreme densities, it acts as a barrier to high-precision pulsar timing experiments. An improved methodology based on the Bayesian inference is developed to simultaneously model the stochastic and deterministic parameters for a sample of 85 high- radio pulsars observed for \u223c10 yr with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. Timing noise is known to be a red process and we develop a parametrization based on the red-noise amplitude (Ared) and spectral index (\u03b2). We measure the median Ared to be  yr3/2 and \u03b2 to be  and show that the strength of timing noise scales proportionally to , where \u03bd is the spin frequency of the pulsar and  is its spin-down rate. Finally, we measure significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:m4fbC6XIj1kC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6358747026868326535", "cites_id": ["6358747026868326535"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/489/3/3810/5556951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h9AOGbvOPlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 18, "2021": 24, "2022": 22, "2023": 9}}
