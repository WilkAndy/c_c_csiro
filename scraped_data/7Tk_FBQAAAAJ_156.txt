The sample includes 37 radio-quiet or radio-faint pulsars which cannot be timed with other telescopes. These timing solutions and the corresponding pulse times of arrival are prerequisites for further study, eg, phase-resolved spectroscopy or searches for mode switches. Many \u03b3-ray pulsars are strongly affected by timing noise (TN), and we present a new method for characterizing the noise process and mitigating its effects on other facets of the timing model. We present an analysis of TN over the population using a new metric for characterizing its strength and spectral shape, namely, its time-domain correlation. The dependence of the strength on \u03bd and  is in good agreement with previous studies. We find that noise process power spectra S (f) for unrecycled pulsars are steep, with strong correlations over our entire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9213377257378346112", "cites_id": ["9213377257378346112"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/814/2/128/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gPSyD8193H8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 15, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
