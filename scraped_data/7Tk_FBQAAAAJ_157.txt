Its\u223c 1 \u03bcs absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity in the 30 MeV\u201330 GeV range, with simultaneous X-ray monitoring in the 18\u201360 keV band, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following up on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory/EGRET heritage. In this paper, we present the first AGILE timing results on the known gamma-ray pulsars Vela, Crab, Geminga, and B1706\u2212 44. The data were collected from 2007 July to 2008 April, exploiting the mission Science Verification Phase, the Instrument Timing Calibration, and the early Observing Pointing Program. Thanks to its large field of view, AGILE collected a large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (\u223c 10,000 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13836517284818697498", "cites_id": ["13836517284818697498"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/691/2/1618/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Gr0rWikvBcAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 11, "2010": 18, "2011": 18, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
