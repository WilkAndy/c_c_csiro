Pulsed X-ray emission at the radio period is marginally detected by ASCA from a source embedded in the hard-spectrum X-ray nebula AX J1420. 1-6049. At radio wavelengths, the pulsar is found to be strongly linearly and circularly polarized, and the polarization sweep is measured. A comparison of high-resolution Australia Telescope Compact Array radio imaging of the Kookaburra's upper wing (G313. 6+ 0.3), which contains the pulsar and the X-ray nebula, with infrared images suggests the radio emission is partly nonthermal."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5410854692558503252", "cites_id": ["5410854692558503252"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/324752/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VH00yaw3F0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
