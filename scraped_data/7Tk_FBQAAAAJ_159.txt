This survey resulted in the discovery of millisecond pulsar J1745+1017, which resides in a short-period binary system with a low-mass companion, , indicative of \u2018black widow\u2019 type systems. A 2-yr timing campaign has produced a refined radio ephemeris, accurate enough to allow for phase-folding of the LAT photons, resulting in the detection of a dual-peaked \u03b3-ray light curve, proving that PSR J1745+1017 is the source responsible for the \u03b3-ray emission seen in 1FGL J1745.5+1018 (2FGL J1745.6+1015; Nolan et al. ). We find the \u03b3-ray spectrum of PSR J1745+1017 to be well modelled by an exponentially cut-off \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7536331649033743328", "cites_id": ["7536331649033743328"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/429/2/1633/1044753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4KsworRtlmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
