We discuss the computational challenges arising from the processing of the terabyte-sized survey data. Two new radio interference mitigation techniques are introduced, as well as a partially coherent segmented acceleration search algorithm which aims to increase our chances of discovering highly relativistic short-orbit binary systems, covering a parameter space including potential pulsar\u2013black hole binaries. We show that under a constant acceleration approximation, a ratio of data length over orbital period of \u22480.1 results in the highest effectiveness for this search algorithm. From the 50 per cent of data processed thus far, we have redetected 435 previously known pulsars and discovered a further 60 pulsars, two of which are fast-spinning \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17143626556777373099", "cites_id": ["17143626556777373099"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/450/3/2922/1061004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qx2rxoVl6u0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 8}}
