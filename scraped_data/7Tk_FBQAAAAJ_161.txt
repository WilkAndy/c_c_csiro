The pulsar is in a binary orbit about its approximately 20\u2009M\u2299 companion LS 2883. Our best-fitting timing solution has none of the pulse-number ambiguities that have plagued previous attempts to model the binary orbit. We measure significant first and second time derivatives of the projected semimajor axis and longitude of the periastron of the orbit. These variations are found to be consistent with the precession of the orbital plane due to classical spin\u2013orbit coupling. The derived moment of inertia and spin of the companion are consistent with the companion rotating at near-break-up velocity. The system configuration is also consistent with the geometry derived from both the polarization of the radio emission and the eclipse of the pulsar by the equatorial disc of the companion. We find strong evidence for orbital period decay that can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1950670576417602845", "cites_id": ["1950670576417602845"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/437/4/3255/1001679", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HX0t3Y0sEhsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
