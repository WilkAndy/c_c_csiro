All four MSPs are in binary systems and are likely to have white dwarf companions. In addition, we present updated timing solutions for 12 previously published HTRU MSPs, revealing new observational parameters such as five proper motion measurements and significant temporal dispersion measure variations in PSR J1017\u22127156. We discuss the case of PSR J1801\u22123210, which shows no significant period derivative \u1e56 after four years of timing data. Our best-fitting solution shows a \u1e56 of the order of 10\u221223, an extremely small number compared to that of a typical MSP. However, it is likely that the pulsar lies beyond the Galactic Centre, and an unremarkable intrinsic \u1e56 is reduced to close to zero by the Galactic potential acceleration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5436032365358813990", "cites_id": ["5436032365358813990"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/439/2/1865/1014482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JhO9jKKqcEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 10, "2016": 12, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
