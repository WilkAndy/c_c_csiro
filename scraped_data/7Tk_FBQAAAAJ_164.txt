As there is a high incidence of such systems in globular clusters2, these are good places to search for millisecond pulsars; so far, ten globular-cluster pulsars have been detected unambiguously. Using the Parkes radiotelescope in Australia, we have found a pulsar with a period of 5.75 ms and a dispersion measure of 25 cm\u20133 pc in the direction of 47 Tucanae. Despite its probable origin as a member of a binary system, timing measurements show that the pulsar is now single. The observed dispersion measure is consistent with the pulsar lying outside the galactic electron layer and within 47 Tucanae; but it is very different from the value of 67 cm\u20133 pc for the pulsars that were reported recently3,4 as being in this globular cluster \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2017882846912486160", "cites_id": ["2017882846912486160"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/345598a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EJuSEML1ABwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 8, "1992": 4, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
