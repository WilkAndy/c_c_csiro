We detect and resolve H\u2009i in 11 galaxies down to a column density of \u223c1020 cm\u22122 inside a \u223c6 deg2 field and with a resolution of \u223c1 arcmin on the sky and \u223c8 \u2009km\u2009s\u22121 in velocity. We present H\u2009i images, velocity fields and integrated spectra of all detections, and highlight the discovery of three H\u2009i clouds \u2013 two in the proximity of the galaxy IC 5270 and one close to NGC 7418. Each cloud has an H\u2009i mass of \u223c109 M\u2299 and accounts for \u223c15\u2009per\u2009cent of the H\u2009i associated with its host galaxy. Available images at ultraviolet, optical and infrared wavelengths do not reveal any clear stellar counterpart of any of the clouds, suggesting that they are not gas-rich dwarf neighbours of IC 5270 and NGC 7418.
