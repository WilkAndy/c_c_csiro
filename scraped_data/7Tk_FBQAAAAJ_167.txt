All six are in binary systems with approximately circular orbits and are likely to have white dwarf companions. PSR J1017\u22127156 has a high flux density and a narrow pulse width, making it ideal for precision timing experiments. PSR J1446\u22124701 and PSR J1125\u22125825 are coincident with gamma-ray sources, and folding the high-energy photons with the radio timing ephemeris shows evidence of pulsed gamma-ray emission. PSR J1502\u22126752 has a spin period of 26.7\u2003ms, and its low period derivative implies that it is a recycled pulsar. The orbital parameters indicate it has a very low mass function, and therefore a companion mass much lower than usually expected for such a mildly recycled pulsar.In addition we present \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17414736845608769522", "cites_id": ["17414736845608769522"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/419/2/1752/989704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8tdq0-SSrfEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 13, "2013": 17, "2014": 5, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
