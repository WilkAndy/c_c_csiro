The pulsars have rotational periods from \u223c2.3 ms to \u223c7.5 ms, and all are in binary systems with orbital periods ranging from \u223c0.3 to \u223c150 d. In four of these systems, the most likely companion is a white dwarf, with minimum masses of \u223c0.2 M\u2299. The other pulsar, J1731\u22121847, has a very low mass companion and exhibits eclipses and is thus a member of the \u2018black widow\u2019 class of pulsar binaries. These eclipses have been observed in bands centred near frequencies of 700, 1400 and 3000 MHz, from which measurements have been made of the electron density in the eclipse region. These measurements have been used to examine some possible eclipse mechanisms. The eclipse and other properties of this source are used to perform a comparison with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18046575154322521630", "cites_id": ["18046575154322521630"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/416/4/2455/974277", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hr7I7XxQcvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 11, "2013": 11, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
