Three pulsars were discovered and 16 previously known pulsars detected. In this paper we present two previously unpublished discoveries, both with extremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angular distance, to the Galactic Centre. The survey data also contain the first known detection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar PSR J1550\u22125418. Our survey observation was made 46 d prior to that previously published and places constraints on the beginning of pulsed radio emission from the source.The detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that there are few pulsars in the direction of the inner Galaxy whose flux density spectrum is governed by a flat power \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12755307747998558151", "cites_id": ["12755307747998558151"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/411/3/1575/972018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x-c9-ND0A7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
