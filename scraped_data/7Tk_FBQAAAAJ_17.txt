It will utilize focal plane phased array feeds on the 36 12-m antennas that will compose the array. The large amounts of data present a huge computing challenge, and ASKAP will store data products in an archive after near real-time pipeline processing. This powerful instrument will be deployed at a new radio-quiet observatory, the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in the midwest region of Western Australia, to enable sensitive surveys of the entire sky to address some of the big questions in contemporary physics. As a pathfinder for the SKA, ASKAP will demonstrate field of view enhancement and computing/processing technology as well as the operation of a large-scale radio array in a remote and radio-quiet region of Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 309, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13379415982921951591", "cites_id": ["13379415982921951591"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5164981/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zyk_BPM7rbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 18, "2011": 35, "2012": 34, "2013": 18, "2014": 26, "2015": 21, "2016": 21, "2017": 16, "2018": 15, "2019": 27, "2020": 18, "2021": 30, "2022": 21, "2023": 5}}
