The lack of older associations has been attributed in the past to the belief that remnants older than this are rare. Given new evidence which suggests that remnants can reach such ages, we argue that it is possible that associations older than 100000 yr exist. We show that a significant fraction of such associations should have the pulsar outside the associated remnant, and suggest a possible association between the SNR W 41 and PSR B1830 \u2013 08 where this is the case."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2390372310852346628", "cites_id": ["2390372310852346628"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/275/1/L73/1004203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BKNItfNOLCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
