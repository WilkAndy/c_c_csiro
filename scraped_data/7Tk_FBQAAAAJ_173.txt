DMs were fitted across 256\u2009MHz of bandwidth for observations centred at 1.4\u2009GHz and across three frequencies \u2013 0.7, 1.4 and 3.1\u2009GHz \u2013 where multifrequency observations were available. Changes in dispersion measure, dDM/dt, were calculated using a weighted linear fit across all epochs of available DMs. DM variations were detected at a 3\u03c3 level in 11 pulsars, four of which were above 5\u03c3: PSRs J0835\u22124510, J0908\u22124913, J1824\u22121945 and J1833\u22120827. We find that after 28 years of gradual decline, the DM of PSR J0835\u22124510 is now increasing. The magnitude of variations in three of the four (PSRs J0835\u22124510, J0908\u22124913 and J1833\u22120827) are above what models would predict for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2889862238066202563", "cites_id": ["2889862238066202563"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/435/2/1610/1043231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w1fA9WTaGigJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
