We detected radio pulsations at 2 GHz, visible for< 10% of\u223c 4.5 hr of observations using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Observations at 5 GHz with the GBT and at several lower frequencies with Parkes, Nan\u00e7ay, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope resulted in non-detections. We also report the faint detection of a steep spectrum continuum radio source (0.1 mJy at 5 GHz) in interferometric imaging observations with the Jansky Very Large Array. These detections demonstrate that PSR J1311\u2212 3430 is not radio quiet and provide additional evidence that radio-quiet MSPs are rare. The radio dispersion measure of 37.8 pc cm\u2212 3 provides a distance estimate of 1.4 kpc for the system, yielding a gamma-ray efficiency of 30 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10480599337009089729", "cites_id": ["10480599337009089729"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/763/1/L13/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wQyfg5GRcpEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 16, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
