PSRs J0101\u20136422, J1514\u20134946, and J1902\u20135105 reside in binaries, while PSRs J1658\u20135324 and J1747\u20134036 are isolated. Using an ephemeris derived from timing observations of PSR J0101\u20136422 (P= 2.57 ms, DM= 12 pc cm\u2212 3), we have detected \u03b3-ray pulsations and measured its proper motion. Its \u03b3-ray spectrum (a power law of \u0393= 0.9 with a cutoff at 1.6 GeV) and efficiency are typical of other MSPs, but its radio and \u03b3-ray light curves challenge simple geometric models of emission. The high success rate of this survey\u2014enabled by selecting \u03b3-ray sources based on their detailed spectral characteristics\u2014and other similarly successful searches indicate that a substantial fraction of the local population of MSPs may soon be known."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10226919038715990268", "cites_id": ["10226919038715990268"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/748/1/L2/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_JBYYa5Q7Y0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 17, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
