The pulsar characteristic age of 12,000 years and its estimated distance are comparable to the corresponding estimates for the remnant, confirming the association. The location of the pulsar suggests that it plays a significant role in determining the morphology of the remnant. Two large glitches and one smaller glitch have been observed in the pulsar period since the beginning of our observations, making it the most actively glitching pulsar known."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10944686646192833491", "cites_id": ["10944686646192833491"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992ApJ...399L.155K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0wNJbIRW45cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 7, "1996": 9, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
