Observations of PSR J1622\u20134950 with Chandra (in 2007 and 2009) and XMM (in 2011) show that the X-ray flux of PSR J1622\u20134950 has decreased by a factor of\u223c 50 over 3.7 years, decaying exponentially with a characteristic time of \u03c4= 360\u00b111 days. This behavior identifies PSR J1622\u20134950 as a possible addition to the small class of transient magnetars. The X-ray decay likely indicates that PSR J1622\u20134950 is recovering from an X-ray outburst that occurred earlier in 2007, before the 2007 Chandra observations. Observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array show strong radio variability, including a possible radio flaring event at least one and a half years after the 2007 X-ray outburst that may be a direct result of this X-ray event.
