Constraints are formed both from the goodness-of-fit of the position angles to the Rotating Vector Model and from the beam opening angle considering aberration and retardation effects. Uncertainties on the relevant parameters are systematically taken into account in order to produce a more robust constraint, using a new approach. Surprisingly, we find that the distribution of the magnetic inclination angle (\u03b1) in this subset of pulsars peaks at low values, contrary to the predictions of \u03b3-ray models. We find a lack of correlation between these and a set of \u03b1 values which were derived using \u03b3-ray light curves, suggesting a problem in the interpretation of the data in one or both of these domains. Finally, we also show that the \u03b1 distribution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4382854921497398387", "cites_id": ["4382854921497398387"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/446/4/3367/2891895", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c8zsaVQH0zwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
