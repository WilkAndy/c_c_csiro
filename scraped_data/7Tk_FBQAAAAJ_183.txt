The inferred plasma pressures of the lenses are ~103 times the ambient pressure, challenging our understanding of gas conditions in the Milky Way. Using a new survey technique, we discovered an ESE while it was in progress. Here we report radio and optical follow-up observations. Modeling of the radio data demonstrates that the lensing structure is a density enhancement and the lens is diverging, ruling out one of two competing physical models. Our technique will uncover many more ESEs, addressing a long-standing mystery of the small-scale gas structure of our Galaxy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6967088096106052671", "cites_id": ["6967088096106052671"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aac7673", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P_xAz7URsGAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 9, "2018": 16, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
