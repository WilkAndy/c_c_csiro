Data in the \u03b3-ray band were acquired by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, while the radio rotational ephemerides used to fold the \u03b3-ray light curves were obtained using the Green Bank Telescope, the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, and the Parkes Telescope. The two young radio pulsars, located within the error circles of the previously unidentified EGRET sources 3EG J1048\u2212 5840 and 3EG J2227+ 6122, present spin-down characteristics similar to the Vela pulsar. PSR J1048\u2212 5832 shows two sharp peaks at phases 0.15\u00b10.01 and 0.57\u00b10.01 relative to the radio pulse confirming the EGRET light curve, while PSR J2229+ 6114 presents a very broad peak at phase 0.49\u00b10.01.
