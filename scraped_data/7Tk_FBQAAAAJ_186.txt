FRB 151230 is observed to be 6 \u00b1 11 per cent circularly polarized and 35 \u00b1 13 per cent linearly polarized with a rotation measure (RM) consistent with zero. Conversely, FRB 160102 is observed to have a circular polarization fraction of 30 \u00b1 11 per cent, linear polarization fraction of 84 \u00b1 15 per cent for RM = \u2212221(6) radm\u22122, and the highest measured dispersion measure (2596.1 \u00b1 0.3 pc cm\u22123) for an FRB to date. We examine possible progenitor models for FRB 160102 in extragalactic, non-cosmological and cosmological scenarios. After accounting for the Galactic foreground contribution, we estimate the intrinsic RM to be \u2212256(9) rad m\u22122 in the low-redshift case and \u223c\u22122.4\u00d7102 rad m\u22122 in the high-redshift \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15795608133148963677", "cites_id": ["15795608133148963677"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/478/2/2046/4992334", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XXOdi-hFNdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 16, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
