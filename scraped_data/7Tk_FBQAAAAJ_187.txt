The observations of the \u03bb21-cm line were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and were combined with single-dish data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. The spatial resolution is 90 arcsec, and the velocity resolution is 1 km s\u22121. A sensitivity of \u223c0.7 K was achieved. The results revealed a double-lobed feature of reduced emission at +16 km s\u22121, centred on the central compact object (CCO), and aligned with an Hi hole blueshifted by 13 km s\u22121. The Hi depressions have probably been created by the sweeping up of \u223c2 M\u2299. The alignment between the lobes and the optical expansion centre of Puppis A suggests that the CCO could be ejecting two opposite jets. The velocity at which the two lobes are best defined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6982455693943045239", "cites_id": ["6982455693943045239"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/345/2/671/1747252", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d_xggXWq5mAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4}}
