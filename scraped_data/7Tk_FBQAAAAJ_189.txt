The \u03b3-ray light curve of PSR J1119\u2212 6127 shows a single, wide peak offset from the radio peak by 0.43\u00b10.02 in phase. Spectral analysis suggests a power law of index 1.0\u00b10.3+ 0.4\u2212 0.2 with an energy cutoff at 0.8\u00b10.2+ 2.0\u2212 0.5 GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. We discuss the emission models of PSR J1119\u2212 6127 and demonstrate that despite the object's high surface magnetic field\u2014near that of magnetars\u2014the field strength and structure in the \u03b3-ray emitting zone are apparently similar to those of typical young pulsars. Additionally, we present upper limits on the \u03b3-ray pulsed emission for the magnetically active PSR J1846\u2212 0258 in the supernova remnant Kesteven 75 and two other energetic high-B pulsars, PSRs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4067476039772783242", "cites_id": ["4067476039772783242"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/743/2/170/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:isIRY-iTcjgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 13, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
