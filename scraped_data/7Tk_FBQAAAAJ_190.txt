The spin-down power of this young pulsar is great enough to make it very likely the counterpart for the EGRET source. We report here the discovery of \u03b3-ray pulsations from PSR J1028\u2212 5819 in early observations by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. The \u03b3-ray light curve shows two sharp peaks having phase separation of 0.460\u00b10.004, trailing the very narrow radio pulse by 0.200\u00b10.003 in phase, very similar to that of other known \u03b3-ray pulsars. The measured \u03b3-ray flux gives an efficiency for the pulsar of\u223c 10\u201320%(for outer magnetosphere beam models). No evidence of a surrounding pulsar wind nebula is seen in the current Fermi data but limits on associated emission \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2212943414354326572", "cites_id": ["2212943414354326572"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/695/1/L72/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LDShiE_0tR4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 10, "2010": 14, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
