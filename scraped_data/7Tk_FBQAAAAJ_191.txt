Under the hypothesis that the density spectrum is due to plasma turbulence, we can thus investigate the (inner) scale at which the turbulence is dissipated. We report observations carried out with the Parkes radio telescope at 660 MHz from which we find strong evidence for an inner scale in the range 70\u2013100 km, assuming an isotropic Kolmogorov spectrum. By identifying the inner scale with the ion inertial scale, we can also estimate the mean electron density of the scattering region to be 5\u201310 cm\u22123. This is comparable with the electron density of H ii region G339.1\u22120.4, which lies in front of the pulsar, and so \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14896643447519169770", "cites_id": ["14896643447519169770"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/395/3/1391/998210", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6swHK0qCu84J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 0, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
