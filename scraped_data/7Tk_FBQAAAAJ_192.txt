In contrast, the high-frequency surveys can penetrate the inner regions of the Galaxy. I show that a simple Gaussian radial distribution would result in the detection of many more pulsars in the inner few kpc than are actually observed. An improved model for the radial distribution is derived, with a peak in the pulsar distribution at 4 kpc from the Galactic Centre. This model is discussed in the context of distributions of related objects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4488643249041208711", "cites_id": ["4488643249041208711"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/268/2/595/1052334", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h3WOzkDdSj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 7, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
