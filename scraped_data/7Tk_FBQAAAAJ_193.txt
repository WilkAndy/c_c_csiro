Repeated observations through 2016 have not detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star, as inferred from its rotation frequency derivative , decreased in an unsteady manner by a factor of three in the first year of radio monitoring, until approximately mid-2007. By contrast, during its final year as a detectable radio source, the torque decreased steadily by only 9%. The period-averaged flux density, after decreasing by a factor of 20 during the first 10 months of radio monitoring, remained relatively steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7\u00b10.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz, while still showing day-to-day fluctuations by factors of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13308173452579690000", "cites_id": ["13308173452579690000"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/820/2/110/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ENZL0j4hsLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
