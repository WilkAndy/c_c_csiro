Using modern Bayesian techniques, we investigated the timing noise properties of 300 bright southern-sky radio pulsars that have been observed over 1.0\u20134.8\u2009yr by the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). We reanalysed the spin and spin-down changes associated with nine previously reported pulsar glitches, report the discovery of three new glitches and four unusual glitch-like events in the rotational evolution of PSR J1825\u22120935. We develop a refined Bayesian framework for determining how red noise strength scales with pulsar spin frequency (\u03bd) and spin-down frequency (), which we apply to a sample of 280 non-recycled pulsars. With this new method and a simple power-law scaling relation, we show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:W2uZP3ddy8sC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8996210172690007591", "cites_id": ["8996210172690007591"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/494/1/228/5780241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J4bx83z12HwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 17, "2022": 18, "2023": 11}}
