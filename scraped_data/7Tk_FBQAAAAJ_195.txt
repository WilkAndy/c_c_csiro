It also improves extrapolations from the observed population to estimate the contribution of unresolved pulsars to the diffuse gamma-ray emission. We use a recently developed method to determine the probability that a given gamma-ray photon comes from a known position in the sky, convolving the photon's energy with the LAT's energy-dependent point-spread function, without the need for an accurate spatial and spectral model of the gamma-ray sky around the pulsar. The method is simple and fast and, importantly, provides probabilities, or weights, for gamma-rays from pulsars too faint for phase-integrated detection. We applied the method to over a thousand pulsars for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:YTuZlYwrTOUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1891256989741332435", "cites_id": ["1891256989741332435"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaf57d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:07eBPDYYPxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 19, "2023": 4}}
