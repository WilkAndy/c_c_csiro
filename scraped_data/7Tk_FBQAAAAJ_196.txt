Recently, examples of longer term emission variability have emerged that are often correlated with changes in the rotational properties of the pulsar. To further illuminate this relationship, we have developed techniques to identify emission and rotation variability in pulsar data, and determine correlations between the two. Individual observations may be too noisy to identify subtle changes in the pulse profile. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression to model noisy observations and produce a continuous map of pulse profile variability. Generally, multiple observing epochs are required to obtain the pulsar spin frequency derivative (). GP regression is, therefore, also used to obtain , under the hypothesis that pulsar timing noise is primarily caused by unmodelled changes in . Our techniques distinguish between two types of variability: changes in the total flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3149990480499877184", "cites_id": ["3149990480499877184"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/456/2/1374/1063258", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QKUOFKcDtysJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
