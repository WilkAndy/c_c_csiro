An additional sample of 10 pulsars showed a rather constant RM with phase, yet a small degree of RM fluctuation is visible in at least three of those cases. In all cases, we have found that the rotation of the polarization position angle across our 1.4 GHz observing band is consistent with the \u03bb2 law of interstellar Faraday rotation. We provide for the first time convincing evidence that RM variations across the pulse are largely due to interstellar scattering, although we cannot exclude that magnetospheric Faraday rotation may still have a minor contribution; alternative explanations of this phenomenon, like erroneous de\u2013dispersion and the presence of non\u2013orthogonal polarization modes, are excluded. If the observed, phase\u2013resolved RM variations are common amongst pulsars, then many of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16905978949768074651", "cites_id": ["16905978949768074651"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/396/3/1559/1746776", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m1UoeUganuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 12, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
