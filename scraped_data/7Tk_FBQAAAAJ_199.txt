Pulsar B1641\u201345 has a simple average profile with minimal evidence for microstructure, while B0950+08 has a complicated pulse profile with strong microstructure and multiple active components. Detailed fitting shows that the primary emission from both pulsars corresponds to lognormal statistics, consistent with stochastic growth theory (SGT) and implying the radiation is generated by a linear micro-instability (either directly or via linear mode conversion). Evidence exists for multiple emission components, with the lognormal parameters and overall field statistics varying with phase. A Gaussian-distributed secondary component for both pulsars, which increases towards the peak in the average profile, may be the result of scattering by density \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18013993807299420224", "cites_id": ["18013993807299420224"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/353/1/270/1040873", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QCAr7uyP_vkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 6, "2012": 10, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
