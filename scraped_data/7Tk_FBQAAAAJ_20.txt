These signals are dispersed according to a precise physical law and this dispersion is a key observable quantity, which, in tandem with a redshift measurement, can be used for fundamental physical investigations,. Every fast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, but none before now have had a redshift measurement, because of the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial coordinates. Here we report the discovery of a fast radio burst and the identification of a fading radio transient lasting ~6 days after the event, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy\u2019s redshift to be z\u2009=\u20090.492\u2009\u00b1\u20090.008. The dispersion measure and redshift, in combination, provide a direct measurement of the cosmic density of ionized baryons in the intergalactic medium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 273, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3303180328860011209", "cites_id": ["3303180328860011209"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yUrCEgJB1y0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 74, "2017": 54, "2018": 43, "2019": 44, "2020": 18, "2021": 18, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
