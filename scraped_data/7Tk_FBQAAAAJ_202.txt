The present investigation uses 54 pulsars, the largest to date sample of pulsars with proper motion and absolute polarization, to study this effect. Our study has found strong evidence for pulsar spin\u2013velocity alignment, excluding that those two vectors are completely uncorrelated, with> 99 per cent confidence. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of orthogonal spin\u2013velocity configurations, comparison of the data with simulations shows that the scenario of aligned vectors is more likely than that of the orthogonal case. Moreover, we have determined the spread of velocities that a spin-aligned and spin-orthogonal distribution of kicks must have to produce the observed distribution of spin\u2013velocity angle offsets.
