Observations of the pulsar scintillation made with the Parkes radio telescope at 20 and 70cm indicate a velocity less than 50km/s. This fact, coupled with statistical arguments and the morphology of both the SNR and the pulsar plerion, shows that the association between the two objects is merely geometric projection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10474731149735596467", "cites_id": ["10474731149735596467"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996A%26A...306L..49N", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s5G1sXu4XZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 8, "1998": 6, "1999": 0, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
