Data in the \u03b3-ray band were acquired by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST), while the radio rotational ephemeris used to fold \u03b3-rays was obtained using both the Green Bank Telescope and the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank. The light curve consists of two peaks separated by 0.49\u00b10.01\u00b10.01 cycles which are aligned with the X-ray peaks. The first \u03b3-ray peak trails the radio pulse by 0.08\u00b10.01\u00b10.01, while its amplitude decreases with increasing energy as for the other \u03b3-ray pulsars. Spectral analysis of the pulsed \u03b3-ray emission suggests a simple power law of index\u2212 2.1\u00b10.1\u00b10.2 with an exponential cutoff at 3.0+ 1.1\u2212 0.7\u00b10.4 GeV. The first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.
