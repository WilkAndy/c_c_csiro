The average interval between observations was about 9d and the observation duration ranged between 2 and 6h depending on the pulsar. Wide variations in the DISS parameters were observed over the 18-month data span. Despite this, the average scintillation velocities are in excellent agreement with the proper motion velocities. The average two-dimensional autocorrelation function for PSR B0329+54 is well described by a thin-screen Kolmogorov model, at least along the time and frequency axes. Observed modulation indices for the DISS time-scale and bandwidth and the pulsar flux density are greater than values predicted for a Kolmogorov spectrum of electron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14273034941147599220", "cites_id": ["14273034941147599220"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/358/1/270/1036313", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dFHXPagBFMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
