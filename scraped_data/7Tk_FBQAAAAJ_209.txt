Towards PSR J1057\u22125226, we discovered a 3 yr span of strengthened scattering during which the variability in flux density and the scintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the scattering region is \u223c23\u2009au, and strong flux density enhancement before and after the ESE may arise from refractive focusing. Long observations reveal scintillation arcs characteristic of interference between rays scattered at large angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest scattering by a screen 100\u2013200\u2009pc from the Earth, perhaps ionized filamentary structure associated with the boundary of the local bubble(s). Towards PSR J1740\u22123015, we observed a \u2018double dip\u2019 in the measured flux density similar to ESEs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7639885212046387465", "cites_id": ["7639885212046387465"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/474/4/4637/4683261", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CenIXB9TBmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
