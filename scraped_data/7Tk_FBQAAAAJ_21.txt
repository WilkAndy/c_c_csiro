We describe the analysis techniques including a maximum likelihood method for determining pulse times of arrival from unbinned photon data. A major result of this work is improved position determinations, which are crucial for multiwavelength follow-up. For most of the pulsars, we overlay the timing localizations on X-ray images from Swift and describe the status of X-ray counterpart associations. We report glitches measured in PSRs J0007+ 7303, J1124\u2212 5916, and J1813\u2212 1246. We analyze a new 20 ks Chandra ACIS observation of PSR J0633+ 0632 that reveals an arcminute-scale X-ray nebula extending to the south of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 269, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4486722301231301503", "cites_id": ["4486722301231301503"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/194/2/17/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fwO3SikKRD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 15, "2012": 22, "2013": 39, "2014": 22, "2015": 21, "2016": 18, "2017": 16, "2018": 20, "2019": 24, "2020": 14, "2021": 21, "2022": 23, "2023": 11}}
