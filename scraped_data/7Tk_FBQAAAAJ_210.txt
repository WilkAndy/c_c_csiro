We have exploited the low system temperature and high bandwidth of the receiver to obtain profiles which have good signal-to-noise for most of our sample at this relatively high frequency. Although, as expected, a number of profiles are less linearly polarized at 3.1 GHz than at lower frequencies, we identify some pulsars and particular components of profiles in other pulsars which have increased linear polarization at this frequency. We discuss the dependence of linear polarization with frequency in the context of a model in which emission consists of the superposition of two, orthogonally polarized modes. We show that a simple model, in which the orthogonal modes have different spectral indices, can explain many of the observed properties of the frequency evolution of both the linear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1063474296220299407", "cites_id": ["1063474296220299407"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/359/2/481/986999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jzD45Tw4wg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
