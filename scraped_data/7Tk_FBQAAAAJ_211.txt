We have used the ATCA in its pulsar-gating mode; this enables an image to be formed containing only off-pulse visibilities, thereby dramatically improving the sensitivity to any underlying PWN. Data from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope were also used to provide sensitivity on larger spatial scales. This survey found a faint new PWN around PSR B0906-49; here we report on non-detections of PWNe towards PSRs B1046-58, B1055-52, B1610-50 and J1105-6107. Our radio observations of the field around PSR B1055-52 argue against previous claims of an extended X-ray and radio PWN associated with the pulsar. If these pulsars power unseen, compact radio PWNe, upper limits on the radio flux indicate that a fraction of less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16698106805393638068", "cites_id": ["16698106805393638068"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/308/3/609/973097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tEIFTauXu-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 10, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
