We investigated the relationship between circulating vitamin D level and CRC survival.We sequentially sampled 92 patients undergoing CRC resection, and measured plasma 25OHD and CRP. For survival analyses, we assayed 25OHD and CRP in two temporally distinct CRC patient cohorts (n=2006, n=2100) and investigated the association between survival outcome, circulating vitamin D and systemic inflammatory response.Serial sampling revealed a postoperative fall (mean 17.3\u2009nmol/L; p=3.6e-9) in plasma 25OHD (nadir days 1\u20132). CRP peaked 3\u20135 days postoperatively (143.1\u2009mg/L; p=1.4e-12), yet the postoperative fall in 25OHD was independent of CRP. In cohort analyses, 25OHD was lower in the 12\u2009months following operation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:RXiHnyRawswC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14663611903452268939", "cites_id": ["14663611903452268939"], "pub_url": "https://gut.bmj.com/content/69/1/103.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i0l2xVWdf8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 15, "2021": 13, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
