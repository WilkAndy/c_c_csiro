We use simulations to show that these modulations are statistically significant and of high quality (sinusoidal) even when contaminated by the strong stochastic timing noise common to young pulsars. Although planetary companions could induce such modulation, the large implied masses and 2:1 mean motion resonances challenge such an explanation. Instead, the modulation is likely to be intrinsic to the pulsar, arising from quasi-periodic switching between stable magnetospheric states, and we propose that precession of the neutron star may regulate this switching."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10478892733799559104", "cites_id": ["10478892733799559104"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/455/2/1845/1121898", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wG-L_WuBbJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 10, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
