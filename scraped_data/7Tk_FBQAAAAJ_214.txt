All nine were detected at 17 GHz, additionally, we detected PSR J0835\u20134510 and J1622\u20134950 at 24 GHz. Polarization profiles of each pulsar and the variation with frequency are discussed. In general, we find that the highly polarized edge components of young pulsars continue to dominate their profiles at 17 GHz. Older pulsars (\u2273105 yr) appear to be almost completely depolarized. Our detection of PSR J0437\u20134715 is the highest frequency observation of a millisecond pulsar to date, and implies a luminosity at 17 GHz of 14 \u03bcJy kpc2, and a mean spectral index of 2.2.We find that the spectral index of the magnetar PSR J1622\u20134950 is flat between 1.4 and 24 GHz, similar to the other known radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15220457636540947077", "cites_id": ["15220457636540947077"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/416/1/346/1210954", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hZrnOJTtOdMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
