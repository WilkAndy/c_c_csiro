We observed the pulsar for a total of 72 h over a 6 month interval and detected 141 giant pulses. We have obtained correct phasing between the radio arrival times of the giant pulses and the X\u2010ray pulse profile. The giant pulses occur in two phase windows, located 6.7 ms before and 5.0 ms after the mid\u2010point of the X\u2010ray profile. We have detected the integrated profile of the pulsar at 1.4 GHz with a flux density of only 24 \u03bcJy. The statistics of the giant pulses are clearly power law and it is likely that the giant pulses contribute only a few per cent of the integrated pulse flux density, similar to other pulsars with giant pulse emission. Simultaneous X\u2010ray and radio observations show no significant increase in the X\u2010ray flux at the time of the radio giants.
