We also present high-quality polarimetric data on four of them. These further discoveries confirm the high potential of our survey in finding pulsars with very short spin periods. At least two of these five MSPs are excellent candidates to be included in the pulsar timing array projects. Thanks to the wealth of MSP discoveries in the HTRU survey, we revisit the question of whether the luminosity distributions of isolated and binary MSPs are different. Using the Cordes and Lazio distance model and our new and catalogue flux density measurements, we find that 41 of the 42 most luminous MSPs in the Galactic disc are in binaries, and a statistical analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14811849874568996770", "cites_id": ["14811849874568996770"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/433/1/259/1031636", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:omcZAPxCjs0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
