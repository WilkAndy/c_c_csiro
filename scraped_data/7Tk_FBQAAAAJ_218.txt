The Hi 21 cm line observations were carried out using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, complemented with single dish data from the Parkes radio telescope to recover information at all spatial scales. We derive a distance to RCW 103 of 3.1 kpc, in agreement with previous distance measurements. We have also detected a small hole in the Hi emission which is positionally and kinematically coincident with the location of the CCO which confirms the association between the SNR and the CCO. This is the third case of a depression in Hi emission seemingly associated with CCOs in SNRs. The characteristic parameters of the holes such as their size, eccentricity and evacuated mass are similar in all three \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8104466122455296527", "cites_id": ["8104466122455296527"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/influence-of-the-neutron-star-1e-1613485055-in-rcw-103-on-the-surrounding-medium/5AE6115260E9B10C240C0ED9E2534127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D6oiw__YeHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 9, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
