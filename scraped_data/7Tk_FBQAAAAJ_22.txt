The light curve shapes depend sensitively on the magnetic inclination \u03b1 and viewing angle \u03b6. We present the results as maps of observables such as peak multiplicity and \u03b3-ray peak separation in the (\u03b1, \u03b6) plane. These diagrams can be used to locate allowed regions for radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars and to convert observed fluxes to true all-sky emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C", "num_citations": 269, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1055428291365024298", "cites_id": ["1055428291365024298"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/695/2/1289/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KrK1aHCipQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 27, "2010": 44, "2011": 39, "2012": 17, "2013": 23, "2014": 12, "2015": 25, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 16, "2019": 18, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
