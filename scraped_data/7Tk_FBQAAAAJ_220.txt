Regardless of the species, for intelligence (i.e., complex knowledge) to be transmitted certain rules of information theory must still be obeyed. We demonstrate some preliminary results of applying information theory to socially complex marine mammal species (bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales) as well as arboreal squirrel monkeys, because they almost exclusively rely on vocal signals for their communications, producing signals which can be readily characterized by signal analysis. Metrics such as Zipf's Law and higher-order information-entropic structure are emerging as indicators of the communicative complexity characteristic of an \u201cintelligent message\u201d content within these animals\u2019 signals \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13276913039616234625", "cites_id": ["13276913039616234625"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576509005682", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gdQTwBASQbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
