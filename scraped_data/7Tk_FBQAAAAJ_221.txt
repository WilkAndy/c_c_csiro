We fitted the position angle of the linear polarization using the rotating vector model and convincingly show that all the pulsars have the angle between their magnetic and rotation axes close to 90\u00b0. The simplest interpretation of the results is that we see \u2018main pulse\u2019 emission from one pole and \u2018interpulse\u2019 emission from the opposite pole. We have attempted to produce emission maps of the magnetosphere above the polar caps for each pulsar and find that the maps support the view that the emission region in pulsars is complex, even when the profile appears simple. For three pulsars, we can derive emission heights and polar maps which are consistent with emission regions located symmetrically about the magnetic axis and confined to the open field lines.
