We have used the position angle traverse to determine highly constrained solutions to the rotating vector model which shows conclusively that PSR B0906\u221249 is an orthogonal rotator. The accuracy obtained in measuring the geometry is unprecedented. This may allow tests of high-energy emission models, should the pulsar be detected with Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope. Although the impact parameter \u03b2 appears to be frequency dependent, we have shown that this is due to the effect of interstellar scattering. As a result, this pulsar provides some of the strongest evidence yet that the position angle swing is indeed related to a geometrical origin, at least for non-recycled pulsars. We have shown that the beam \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4806980749008454202", "cites_id": ["4806980749008454202"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/390/1/87/973353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OkLK0oXTtUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
