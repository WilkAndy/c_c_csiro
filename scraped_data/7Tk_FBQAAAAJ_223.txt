PSR B 1802\u201307 is a 23-ms pulsar, located within the core of the globular cluster NGC 6539 and a member of a binary system with an orbital period of 2.6 d and ccentricity of 0.21. Timing observations reveal an advance in the longitude of periastron of  yr\u20131. If the periastron advance is due solely to relativistic effects, the total mass of the system is 1.65 \u00b1 0.4 M\u2299 , consistent with a neutron star of mass 1.4 M\u2299 and a white dwarf companion of mass 0.3 M\u2299 . Most pulsar binary systems with low-mass companions have orbits which are extremely circular, due to tidal forces which they experience during the giant phase of their companion\u2019s evolution. The eccentricity of the system may have been induced by interactions with other stars of the globular cluster, or may result from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=49858134015593369", "cites_id": ["49858134015593369"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/260/1/L7/1010821", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mcspb7UhsQAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
