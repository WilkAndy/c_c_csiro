Using the Australian Long Baseline Array, we have conducted very long baseline interferometric observations of PSR\u2009B1259\u221263 over 4.4 years, fully sampling the 3.4-year orbital period. From our measured parallax of 0.38 \u00b1 0.05\u2009mas- we use a Bayesian approach to infer a distance of \u2009kpc. We find that the binary orbit is viewed at an angle of 154 \u00b1 3\u00b0 to the line of sight, implying that the pulsar moves clockwise around its orbit as viewed on the sky. Taking our findings together with previous results from pulsar timing observations, all seven orbital elements for the system are now fully determined. We use our measurement of the inclination angle to constrain the mass of the stellar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6110894126948144309", "cites_id": ["6110894126948144309"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/479/4/4849/5049310", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tdTD4NRBzlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 11, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
