The source shows a highly elongated morphology with the energetic pulsar J1509\u2212 5850 located at the tip. We found a flat radio spectrum of index \u03b1=\u2212 0.26\u00b10.04 and a high degree of linear polarization. These results confirm G319. 9\u2212 0.7 as a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula. The polarization maps suggest a helical magnetic field trailing the pulsar, with the symmetry axis parallel to the system's inferred direction of motion. This is the first time such a field geometry has been seen in a bow-shock nebula, and it may be the result of an alignment between the pulsar spin axis and its space velocity. Compared to other bow-shock examples, G319. 9\u2212 0.7 exhibits very different properties in the field structure and surface brightness distribution, illustrating the large diversity of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10270194472711853961", "cites_id": ["10270194472711853961"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/712/1/596/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iZcriHUPh44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
