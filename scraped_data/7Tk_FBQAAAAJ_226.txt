Although all of these sources have been covered by previous pulsar surveys, the recent discovery of the young, energetic pulsar PSR J1410\u22126132 at 6.7 GHz has shown that pulsars of this type can be hidden from low-frequency surveys. Using an observing frequency of 3.1 GHz, we discovered a 91-ms pulsar, PSR J1028\u22125819, which observations made at the Parkes telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array have shown to be young and energetic. We believe this pulsar is likely to be powering the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1027\u22125817. Like other energetic pulsars, PSR J1028\u22125819 is highly linearly polarized, but astonishingly has a pulse duty cycle of only 0.4 per cent, one of the smallest in the entire pulsar catalogue."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12458945223299503641", "cites_id": ["12458945223299503641"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/389/4/1881/1109358", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GRbRlqsQ56wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
