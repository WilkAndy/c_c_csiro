Over the declination range \u221280\u00b0 < \u03b4 < 10\u00b0, we detect 17 known pulsars with mean flux density greater than 0.3 Jy. We explore the variability properties of this sample on time-scales of minutes to years. For three of these pulsars, PSR J0953+0755, PSR J0437\u22124715, and PSR J0630\u22122834, we observe interstellar scintillation and variability on time-scales of greater than 2 min. One further pulsar, PSR J0034\u22120721, showed significant variability, the physical origins of which are difficult to determine. The dynamic spectra for PSR J0953+0755 and PSR J0437\u22124715 show discrete time and frequency structure consistent with diffractive interstellar scintillation and we present the scintillation bandwidth and time-scales from these observations. The remaining pulsars within our sample were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4021125569454869622", "cites_id": ["4021125569454869622"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/461/1/908/2595268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dgyZjGbozTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
