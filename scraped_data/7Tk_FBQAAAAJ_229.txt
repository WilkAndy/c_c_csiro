We report the discovery of an eclipsing black-widow millisecond pulsar, PSR J1544+ 4937, identified with the uncataloged \u03b3-ray source Fermi J1544. 2+ 4941. This 2.16 ms pulsar is in a 2.9 hr compact circular orbit with a very low mass companion (M c> 0.017M\u2609). At 322 MHz this pulsar is found to be eclipsing for 13% of its orbit, whereas at 607 MHz the pulsar is detected throughout the low-frequency eclipse phase. Variations in the eclipse ingress phase are observed, indicating a clumpy and variable eclipsing medium. Moreover, additional short-duration absorption events are observed around the eclipse boundaries. Using the radio timing ephemeris we were able to detect \u03b3-ray pulsations from this pulsar, confirming it as the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12151826068804509453", "cites_id": ["12151826068804509453"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/773/1/L12/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DZ9sK231o6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
