The survey detected 298 pulsars, of which 101 were previously unknown. The new pulsars include 17 millisecond pulsars. This is the largest sample of both normal and millisecond pulsars detected in any survey. Combining our sample with other recent surveys in the Northern Hemisphere, we present a statistical study of the populations of both normal and millisecond pulsars. We find that the improved statistics allow us to estimate the number and birth-rate of both types of pulsar down to a 400-MHz luminosity limit of 1 mJy kpc2. The local surface densities of potentially observable normal pulsars and millisecond pulsars are both about 30 kpc\u22122, corresponding to \u223c 30000 potentially observable pulsars of each type in the Galaxy.
