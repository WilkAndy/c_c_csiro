We report results obtained from the analysis of 13 months of LAT data for three of these pulsars (PSR J1057\u2212 5226, PSR J1709\u2212 4429, and PSR J1952+ 3252) each of which had some unique feature among the EGRET pulsars. The excellent sensitivity of LAT allows more detailed analysis of the evolution of the pulse profile with energy and also of the variation of the spectral shape with phase. We measure the cutoff energy of the pulsed emission from these pulsars for the first time and provide a more complete picture of the emission mechanism. The results confirm some, but not all, of the features seen in the EGRET data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7740761104886987406", "cites_id": ["7740761104886987406"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/720/1/26/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jvryaza1bGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
