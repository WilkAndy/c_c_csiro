We see no evidence for any changes in the absorption spectra over this time span in spite of good velocity resolution and sensitivity. Towards PSR B1641\u201345 we place an upper limit of 1019 cm\u22122 on the change in the column density of the cold, neutral gas. In addition, we observed PSR B1557\u201350 and compared its H i absorption spectrum with spectra taken in 1980 and 1994. A prominent deep absorption feature seen at \u2212110 km s\u22121 in 1994 is weaker in 2000 and likely was not present at all in 1980. Using the standard interpretation which links the distance traversed by the pulsar to a physical cloud size, this results in a cloud size of \u223c1000 au and density of 2 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123, parameters typical of those seen in other observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12050097532647368970", "cites_id": ["12050097532647368970"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/341/3/941/1006911", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CulBntyLOqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
