These facilitate rapid wide-area imaging via the deployment of simultaneous multiple beams within an \u223c30 deg2 field of view. By cycling the array through 12 interleaved pointing positions and using nine digitally formed beams, we effectively mimic a traditional 1 h \u00d7 108 pointing survey, covering \u223c150 deg2 over 711\u20131015 MHz in 12 h of observing time. Three such observations were executed over the course of a week. We verify the full bandwidth continuum imaging performance and stability of the system via self-consistency checks and comparisons to existing radio data. The combined three epoch image has arcminute resolution and a 1\u03c3 thermal noise level of 375 \u03bcJy beam \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3209097023656958479", "cites_id": ["3209097023656958479"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/457/4/4160/2588968", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DxrWkL0AiSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
