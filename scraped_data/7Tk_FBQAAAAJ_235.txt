The pulsars have rotational periods ranging from 2 to 66 ms, and four are in binary systems with orbital periods between 10.8 h and 9 d. Three of these binary systems are particularly interesting; PSR J1227\u22126208 has a pulse period of 34.5 ms and the highest mass function of all pulsars with near-circular orbits. The circular orbit suggests that the companion is not another neutron star, so future timing experiments may reveal one of the heaviest white dwarfs ever found (>1.3 M\u2299). Timing observations of PSR J1431\u22124715 indicate that it is eclipsed by its companion which has a mass indicating it belongs to the redback class of eclipsing millisecond pulsars. PSR J1653\u22122054 has a companion with a minimum mass of only 0.08\u2009M\u2299, placing it among the class of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13737884230935974605", "cites_id": ["13737884230935974605"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/446/4/4019/2892755", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zRJh7uvEpr4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
