In an image containing only off-pulse emission, we find a weak, slightly extended source coincident with the pulsar's position, which we argue is best interpreted as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). A trail of emission extending behind the pulsar aligns with the major axis of the PWN and implies that the pulsar is moving northwest with a projected velocity\u223c 60 km s , consistent with its scintillation speed. The consequent density we infer for the pulsar's environment is greater than 2 cm , so that the PWN around PSR B0906-49 is confined mainly by the high density of its surroundings rather than by the pulsar's velocity. Other properties of the system such as the PWN's low luminosity and apparent steep spectrum, and the pulsar's large characteristic age, lead us to suggest that this nebula is substantially different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9274030436713708301", "cites_id": ["9274030436713708301"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/311347/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DTt72Iv5s4AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
