This assumption underpins much of the fantastic science made possible via pulsar timing. Over the past few years, however, this assumption has come under question with a number of pulsars showing pulse shape changes on a range of time-scales. Here, we show the dramatic appearance of a bright component in the pulse profile of PSR J0738\u22124042 (B0736\u221240). The component arises on the leading edge of the profile. It was not present in 2004 but strongly present in 2006 and all observations thereafter. A subsequent search through the literature shows that the additional component varies in flux density over time-scales of decades. We show that the polarization properties of the transient component are consistent with the picture of competing orthogonal polarization modes.
