Duai linear polarization receivers are used, each centred at 436 MHz, with a 256-channel filterbank system covering a bandwidth of 32 MHz. Observations are made with the telescope beam centred on an approximately hexagonal grid of 44 299 positions, with an observation time of 157.3 s per pointing. The data are sampled at 300-\u03bcs intervals and recorded on magnetic tape. Off-line analyses are carried out on networked work-stations and involve de-dispersion, fast Fourier transform and harmonic summing. For any significant spectral features, time- and frequency-domain plots are formed. selected candidate pulsars from this stage of analysis are reobserved at parkes to check the reality of the detection.
