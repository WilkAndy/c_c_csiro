The MeerTime project is a five-year program on the MeerKAT array by an international consortium that will regularly time over 1000 radio pulsars to perform tests of relativistic gravity, search for the gravitational wave signature induced by supermassive black hole binaries in the timing residuals of millisecond pulsars, explore the interiors of neutron stars through a pulsar glitch monitoring programme, explore the origin and evolution of binary pulsars, monitor the swarms of pulsars that inhabit globular clusters and monitor radio magnetars. In addition to these primary programmes, over 1000 pulsars will have their arrival times monitored and the data made immediately public. The MeerTime pulsar backend comprises two server-class machines each of which possess four Graphics Processing Units. Up to four pulsars can be coherently dedispersed simultaneously up to dispersion measures of over 1000 pc cm. All data will be provided in psrfits format. The MeerTime backend will be capable of producing coherently dedispersed filterbank data for timing multiple pulsars in the cores of globular clusters that is useful for pulsar searches of tied array beams. All MeerTime data will ultimately be made available for public use, and any published results will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10680850747155073885", "cites_id": ["10680850747155073885"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07424", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XcskOyoBOpQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
