The pulsar is thought to switch between an \u2018off\u2019 state in which no emission is detectable, a weak state and a strong state. We ran three independent transient detection pipelines on two-minute snapshot images from a 13 h BETA observation in order to (1) study the emission from the pulsar, (2) search for other transient emission from elsewhere in the image and (3) to compare the results from the different transient detection pipelines. The pulsar was easily detected as a transient source and, over the course of the observations, it switched into the strong state three times giving a typical time-scale between the strong emission states of 3.7 h. After the first switch it remained in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6302476713642696938", "cites_id": ["6302476713642696938"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/456/4/3948/1032111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6iDY2S3ldlcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
