In particular, we investigate the association of the handedness of circular polarization with the orthogonal polarization mode phenomenon at two different frequencies. We find the association to be significant across the pulse for PSR B1133+16, making a strong case for orthogonal polarization modes determining the observed circular polarization. The association however is not perfect and decreases with frequency. Based on these results and assuming emission occurs in superposed orthogonal polarization modes, we present a technique of mode decomposition based on single pulses. Average profiles of the polarization of each mode can then be computed by adding the individual mode-separated single pulses. We show that decomposing single pulses produces different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15648379770832230012,7785905674037508119", "cites_id": ["15648379770832230012", "7785905674037508119"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2003/22/aah4198/aah4198.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fBbdLn42KtkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 8, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
