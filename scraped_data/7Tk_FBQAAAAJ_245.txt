Using data from the Parkes radio telescope, we observe a smooth and fast spin-down process subsequent to the X-ray bursts resulting in a net change in the pulsar rotational frequency of \u0394\u03bd \u2248 \u22124 \u00d7 10\u22124\u2009Hz. During the transition, a net spin-down rate increase of \u2009Hz\u2009s\u22121 is observed, followed by a return of  to its original value. In addition, the radio pulsations disappeared after the X-ray bursts and reappeared about two weeks later with the flux density at 1.4\u2009GHz increased by a factor of 5. The flux density then decreased and undershot the normal flux density followed by a slow recovery back to normal. The pulsar\u2019s integrated profile underwent dramatic and short-term changes in total intensity, polarization, and position angle.
