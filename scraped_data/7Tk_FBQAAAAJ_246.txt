We present the results of an initial time-resolved census of known pulsars using the Murchison Widefield Array. To significantly reduce the processing load, we incoherently sum the detected powers from the 128 Murchison Widefield Array tiles, which yields ~10% of the attainable sensitivity of the coherent sum. This preserves the large field-of-view (~450 deg2 at 185 MHz), allowing multiple pulsars to be observed simultaneously. We developed a WIde-field Pulsar Pipeline that processes the data from each observation and automatically folds every known pulsar located within the beam. We have detected 50 pulsars to date, 6 of which are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15739693307808038020", "cites_id": ["15739693307808038020"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/census-of-southern-pulsars-at-185-mhz/99F5A44603C1FF837E933C40B9B2A903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hLx9xaufbtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
