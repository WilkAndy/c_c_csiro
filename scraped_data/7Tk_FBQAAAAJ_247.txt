A novel survey program has made it possible to discover these\" Extreme Scattering Events\"(ESEs) in real time, resulting in a high-quality dynamic spectrum of an ESE observed in PKS 1939\u2013315. Here we present a method for determining the column-density profile of a plasma lens, given only the dynamic radio spectrum of the lensed source, under the assumption that the lens is either axisymmetric or totally anisotropic. Our technique relies on the known, strong frequency dependence of the plasma refractive index in order to determine how points in the dynamic spectrum map to positions on the lens. We apply our method to high-frequency (4.2\u201310.8 GHz) data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array of the PKS 1939\u2013315 ESE.
