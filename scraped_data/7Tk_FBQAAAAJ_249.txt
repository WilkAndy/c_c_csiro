Based on 12 years of observations at the Parkes radio telescope, the relativistic Shapiro delay has been detected in this system. We obtain a companion mass M C= 0.180\u00b10.018 M\u2609(1\u03c3) implying that the pulsar mass lies in the range 1.1 M\u2609\u2a7d M P\u2a7d 1.5 M\u2609. We compare our results with previous optical determinations of the companion mass and examine prospects for using this new measurement for calibrating the mass\u2013radius relation for HeWDs and for investigating their evolution in a pulsar binary system. Finally, we examine the set of binary systems hosting a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass HeWD for which the mass of both stars has been measured. We confirm that the correlation between the companion mass and the orbital period predicted by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3731775070900217488", "cites_id": ["3731775070900217488"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/760/2/100/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kGaquqftyTMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
