We show carefully calibrated polarization data for 25 pulsars, 20 of which display linearly polarized emission from the pulse longitude at closest approach to the magnetic pole. Such data allow the determination of the position angle of the linear polarization which in turn reflects the position angle of the rotation axis. Of these 20 pulsars, 10 show an offset between the velocity vector and the polarization position angle which is either less than 10\u00b0 or more than 80\u00b0, a fraction which is very unlikely by random chance. We believe that the bimodal nature of the distribution arises from the presence of orthogonal polarization modes in the pulsar radio emission. In some cases, this orthogonal ambiguity is resolved by observations at other wavelengths so that we conclude that the velocity vector and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 245, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9663166843260148795", "cites_id": ["9663166843260148795"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/364/4/1397/1046415", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O5za2Qt3GoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 13, "2007": 20, "2008": 27, "2009": 13, "2010": 17, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 9, "2015": 18, "2016": 7, "2017": 14, "2018": 15, "2019": 17, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 8}}
