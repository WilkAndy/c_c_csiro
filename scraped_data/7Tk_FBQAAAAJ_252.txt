Its timing parameters imply a characteristic age of 15 Myr, a surface magnetic field of 1.3 \u00d7 1013 G, and a spin-down luminosity of 2.9 \u00d7 1029 erg\u2009s\u22121. Its dispersion measure of 12.12(1) pc\u2009cm\u22123 leads to distance estimates of 0.5 and 1.3 kpc according to the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic free electron density models, respectively. Some of its single pulses show an uninterrupted 180-deg sweep of the phase-resolved polarization position angle, with an S-shape reminiscent of the rotating vector model prediction. However, the fact that this sweep occurs at different phases from one pulse to another is remarkable and without straightforward explanation. Although PSR J2251\u22123711 lies in the region of the  parameter space occupied by the X-ray isolated neutron stars (XINS), there is no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:sfnaS5RM6jYC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10270185721786368440", "cites_id": ["10270185721786368440"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/493/1/1165/5727329", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uIFdDIAHh44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 10}}
