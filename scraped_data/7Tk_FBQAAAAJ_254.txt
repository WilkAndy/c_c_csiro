For the first time we have successfully obtained H i absorption measurements for PSRs J1602-5100,J1740-3015 and J1745-3040. We have also significantly improved the sensitivity and resolution on PSRs J1600-5044,J1752-2806 and J1825-0935, the spectra of which have previously been measured, and have corrected an error in the published distance to PSR J1824-1945.Since the Frail & Weisberg summary of pulsar distances in 1990, a further 23 pulsars now have measured H i distances, mainly through the efforts of the current group. We discuss the Taylor & Cordes electron density model in light of these new measurements and find that, although the model towards the Galactic Centre \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4404115084420921330", "cites_id": ["4404115084420921330"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/322/4/715/1016894", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8jfZ1FWPHj0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
