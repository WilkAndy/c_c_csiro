A simple model suggests that this should not be the case, implying either that some postulated pulsar/remnant associations are false, or that pulsars are particularly difficult to detect until they have emerged from their remnants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8913146946304973140", "cites_id": ["8913146946304973140"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/do-we-expect-to-see-young-pulsars-outside-their-parent-shells/C5A0D6758D24C440950A8996768ECD6F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VJldfezbsXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 7, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
