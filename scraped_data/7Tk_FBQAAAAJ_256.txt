Here we present an analysis of the Vela pulsar spanning nearly 21 yr of observation and including eight glitches. We identify the relative pulse number of all of the observations between glitches, with the only pulse-number ambiguities existing over glitch events. We use the phase coherence of the timing solution to simultaneously model the timing noise and glitches in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to select preferred models for both. We find the glitches can be described using only permanent and transient changes in spin frequency, i.e. no step changes in frequency derivative. For all of the glitches, we only need two exponentially decaying changes in spin frequency to model the transient components. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17851371304912522645", "cites_id": ["17851371304912522645"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/459/3/3104/2595226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lY3pBp_PvPcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
