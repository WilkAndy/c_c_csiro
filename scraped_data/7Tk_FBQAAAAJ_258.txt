Here, we focus on a sample of 28 \u03b3-ray-detected pulsars using data taken as part of the Parkes telescope's FERMI timing program. In doing so, we find a preference in the sample for low magnetic inclination angles, \u03b1, in stark contrast to both the expectation that the magnetic and rotation axes are orientated randomly at the birth of the pulsar and to \u03b3-ray-emission-model-based expected biases. In this paper, after exploring potential explanations, we conclude that there are two possible causes of this preference, namely that low \u03b1 values are intrinsic to the sample, or that the emission regions extend outside what is traditionally thought to be the open-field-line region in a way which is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10230856768905464544", "cites_id": ["10230856768905464544"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/446/4/3356/2891859", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4MqCogZO-40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
