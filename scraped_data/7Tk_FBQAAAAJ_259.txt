However, there exist one detection and several upper limits an order of magnitude or more fainter than this trend. We describe these\" sub-luminous\" \u03b3-ray pulsars and discuss the case for this being an orientation effect. Of the 12 known young radio pulsars with  and d\u2a7d 2 kpc several are substantially sub-luminous. The limited available geometrical constraints favor aligned geometries for these pulsars, although no one case for alignment is compelling. In this scenario GeV emission detected from such sub-luminous pulsars can be due to a lower altitude, lower-power accelerator gap."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12801710680530539804", "cites_id": ["12801710680530539804"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/738/1/114/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HNVYngnQqLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
