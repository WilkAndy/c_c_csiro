Like the Crab pulsar, it is observed to emit giant radio pulses (GPs). We used the newly commissioned PTUSE instrument on the MeerKAT radio telescope to search for GPs across three observations. In a total integration time of 5.7 h, we detected 865 pulses above our 7\u03c3 threshold. With full polarization information for a subset of the data, we estimated the Faraday rotation measure,  rad m\u22122 towards the pulsar. The brightest of these pulses is \u223c60 per cent linearly polarized but the pulse-to-pulse variability in the polarization fraction is significant. We find that the cumulative GP flux distribution follows a power-law distribution with index \u22122.75 \u00b1 0.02. Although the detected GPs make up only \u223c10 per cent of the mean flux, their average pulse shape is indistinguishable from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:v_tt_AnqfNMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7859436531001559540", "cites_id": ["7859436531001559540"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/505/3/4468/6288431", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9IkTReJTEm0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 18, "2023": 7}}
