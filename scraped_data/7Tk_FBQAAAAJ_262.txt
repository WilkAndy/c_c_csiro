This system contains a 3.5-ms pulsar with a \u223c10\u22123\u2009M\u2299 companion in a 7.75-h circular orbit. Follow-up observations at the Parkes and Lovell telescopes have led to precise measurements of the astrometric and spin parameters, including the period derivative, timing parallax, and proper motion. PSR\u2009J2322\u22122650 has a parallax of 4.4 \u00b1 1.2\u2009mas, and is thus at an inferred distance of \u2009pc, making this system a candidate for optical studies. We have detected a source of R \u2248 26.4\u2009mag at the radio position in a single R-band observation with the Keck telescope, and this is consistent with the blackbody temperature we would expect from the companion if it fills its Roche lobe. The intrinsic period derivative of PSR\u2009J2322\u22122650 is among the lowest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14427172248439240959", "cites_id": ["14427172248439240959"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/475/1/469/4710309", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_ziYtbicN8gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
