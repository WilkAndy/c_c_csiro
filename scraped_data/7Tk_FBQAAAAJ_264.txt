We achieve this through measurement of the excess Faraday rotation resulting from propagation of the polarised emission from a number of pulsars through the magnetic field of the solar corona. This method yields independent measures of the integrated electron density, via dispersion of the pulsed signal and the magnetic field, via the amount of Faraday rotation. In principle this allows the determination of the integrated magnetic field through the solar corona along many lines of sight without any assumptions regarding the electron density distribution. We present a detection of an increase in the rotation measure of the pulsar J1801-2304 of approximately 170 rad\u2009m2 at an elongation of 0.96\u00b0 from the centre of the solar disc. This corresponds to a lower limit of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8914079494359971109", "cites_id": ["8914079494359971109"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-007-9030-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JXXrQBIstXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
