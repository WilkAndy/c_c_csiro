Widely accepted explanations do not exist for this variability or for the mechanism producing the radiation. The variability corresponds to the field statistics, particularly the distribution of wave field amplitudes, which are predicted by theories for wave growth in inhomogeneous media. This paper shows that the field statistics of the Vela pulsar (PSR B0833\u201345) are well-defined and vary as a function of pulse phase, evolving from Gaussian intensity statistics off-pulse to approximately power-law and then lognormal distributions near the pulse peak to approximately power-law and eventually Gaussian statistics off-pulse again. Detailed single-component fits confirm that the variability corresponds to lognormal statistics near the peak of the pulse profile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10875261326467864767", "cites_id": ["10875261326467864767"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/343/2/512/1040872", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vxipi46w7JYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
