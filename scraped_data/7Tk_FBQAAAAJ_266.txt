We have also significantly improved the sensitivity and resolution on PSRs J0738-4042, J0837-4135 and J1157-6224, the spectra of which have been measured previously, and obtained the transverse velocities of PSRs J0837-4135 and J0942-5552 by analysing their scintillation properties.We show that the Taylor & Cordes distance model works reasonably well for pulsars located behind the Gum nebula. Following from our earlier work, we show further evidence for strong deviations from a simple Galactic rotation law in the velocities of the HI gas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=237656342245247736", "cites_id": ["237656342245247736"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/279/2/661/1003670", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-IolIi9TTAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
