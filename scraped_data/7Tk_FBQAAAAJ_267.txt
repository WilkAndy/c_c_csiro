RelBin is primarily focused on observations of relativistic effects in binary pulsars to enable measurements of neutron star masses and tests of theories of gravity. We selected 25 pulsars as an initial high priority list of targets based on their characteristics and observational history with other telescopes. In this paper, we provide an outline of the programme, and present polarization calibrated pulse profiles for all selected pulsars as a reference catalogue along with updated dispersion measures. We report Faraday rotation measures for 24 pulsars, twelve of which have been measured for the first time. More than a third of our selected pulsars show a flat position angle swing confirming earlier observations. We demonstrate the ability of the Rotating Vector Model, fitted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:vVJNg6_NJEsC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7195646211533320779", "cites_id": ["7195646211533320779"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/504/2/2094/6136263", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SzLU7xoS3GMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
