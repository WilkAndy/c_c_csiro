The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected XTE J1810\u2212 197 immediately after a November 20\u201326 visibility gap, contemporaneous with its reactivation as a radio pulsar, first observed on December 8. On December 13 the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) detected X-ray emission up to at least 30 keV, with a spectrum well-characterized by a blackbody plus power-law model with temperature kT= 0.74\u00b10.02 keV and photon index \u0393= 4.4\u00b10.2 or by a two-blackbody model with kT= 0.59\u00b10.04 keV and kT= 1.0\u00b10.1 keV, both including an additional power-law component to account for emission above 10 keV, with \u0393 h=\u2212 0.2\u00b11.5 and \u0393 h= 1.5\u00b10.5, respectively. The latter index is consistent with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:QVtou7C4vgoC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10511561018269481085", "cites_id": ["10511561018269481085"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab101a/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fbjLsA2R4JEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
