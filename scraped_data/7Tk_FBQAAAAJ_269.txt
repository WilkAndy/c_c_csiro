In the majority of sources, we find very low levels of variability with typical modulation indices <5 per\u2009cent. We detect 15 candidate low-frequency variables that show significant long-term variability (>2.8 yr) with time-averaged modulation indices  per\u2009cent. With 7/15 of these variable sources having peaked spectral energy distributions, and only 5.7 per\u2009cent of the overall sample having peaked spectra, we find an increase in the prevalence of variability in this spectral class. We conclude that the variability seen in this survey is most probably a consequence of refractive interstellar scintillation and that these objects must have the majority of their flux density contained within angular diameters less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8138595826830907633", "cites_id": ["8138595826830907633"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/482/2/2484/5136431", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8Zi7zMgZ8nAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 9}}
