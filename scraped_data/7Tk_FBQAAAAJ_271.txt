The modulation significance of the light curve above 30 MeV is at a 5\u03c3 confidence level and the light curve is similar to those found earlier by COMPTEL up to 30 MeV: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching its maximum 0.39\u00b10.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94\u00b10.03. The gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed flux detected by COMPTEL and AGILE is well described by a power law (photon index \u03b1= 1.87\u00b10.09) with a remarkable cutoff at E c= 81\u00b120 MeV, representing the softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. The pulsar luminosity at E> 1 MeV is L \u03b3= 4.2+ 0.5\u2212 0.2\u00d7 10 35 erg s\u2212 1, assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiency to gamma rays of\u223c 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14549080329242163065", "cites_id": ["14549080329242163065"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/723/1/707/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eTcaoXm36MkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
