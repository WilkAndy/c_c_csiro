The H\u2003i data were combined with data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to recover the shortest spatial frequencies. In contrast, H\u2003i absorption was analysed by filtering extended H\u2003i emission, with spatial frequencies shorter than 1.1\u2003k\u03bb. The low-resolution ATCA radio continuum image of the remnant shows considerable internal structure, resembling a network of filaments across its 13-arcmin diameter. A high-resolution ATCA radio continuum image was also constructed to study the small-scale structure in the SNR. It shows that there are no structures smaller than \u223c17\u2003arcsec, except perhaps for a bright knot to the south, which is probably an unrelated object. The H\u2003i absorption study shows that the gas distribution and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13756094285575962427", "cites_id": ["13756094285575962427"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/369/1/416/1056428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Oz-JrN52574J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
