Extensive monitoring of the 1994 and 1997 periastron passages has shown that the source flares over a 100 day interval around periastron, varying on timescales as short as a day and peaking at 60 mJy (\u223c 100 times the apastron flux density) at 1.4 GHz. Interpreting the emission as synchrotron radiation, we show that (i) the observed variations in flux density are too large to be caused by the shock interaction between the pulsar wind and an isotropic, radiatively driven, Be star wind and (ii) the radio-emitting electrons do not originate from the pulsar wind. We argue instead that the radio electrons originate from the circumstellar disk of the Be star and are accelerated at two epochs, one before and one after periastron, when the pulsar passes through the disk.
