This method is particularly appropriate for observations of pulsars, where the sign and magnitude of the circular polarisation are useful for understanding the emission processes at work. I apply the method to observations of PSR J1359\u20136038 made using the multibeam receiver on the Parkes radio telescope."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12479797105516028077", "cites_id": ["12479797105516028077"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/single-dish-polarisation-calibration/4796FA6DD3A16BE25E65CFB8027FD891", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rSA7v1glMa0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
