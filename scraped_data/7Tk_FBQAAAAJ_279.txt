(2016). We have established a common flux density scale between the ATCA and JVLA observations, the main result of which is to increase the flux densities obtained by Keane et al. At a frequency of 5.5 GHz, the source has a mean flux density of 140 \u03bcJy and is variable on short timescales with a modulation index of 0.36. Statistical analysis of the flux densities shows that the variations seen are consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation of the weak active galactic nucleus at the centre of the galaxy. It may therefore be the case that the FRB and the galaxy are not associated. However, taking into account the rarity of highly variable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11216466818806561399", "cites_id": ["11216466818806561399"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/465/2/2143/2417036", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d7rr8STlqJsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
