A Galactic Census of pulsars will discover most of the active pulsars in the Galaxy beamed toward us. In this census will almost certainly be pulsar\u2013black hole binaries as well as pulsars orbiting the super-massive black hole in the Galactic centre. These systems are unique in their capability to probe the ultra-strong field limit of relativistic gravity. These measurements can be used to test the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture and the No-Hair theorem. The large number of millisecond pulsars discovered with the SKA will also provide a dense array of precision clocks on the sky. These clocks will act as the multiple arms of a huge gravitational wave detector, which can be used to detect and measure the stochastic cosmological gravitational wave background that is expected from a number of sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 226, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15832217943222816805", "cites_id": ["15832217943222816805"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647304000909", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JZBcMFZWt9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 11, "2007": 12, "2008": 18, "2009": 17, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 12, "2013": 14, "2014": 18, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
