From analysis of the dynamic spectrum we obtained the amplitude of the electron density power spectrum and a scintillation velocity km s-1. This result shows that the Shklovskii effect on the spin-down rate is negligible. We also performed a correlation analysis between pulsar proper motions (Vpm) and scintillation velocities (Viss) using updated measurements for a sample of 77 objects, 17 of which are MSPs. The full sample shows a correlation coefficient at an extremely high significance level, while for the MSP sub-sample (excluding 2 outliers) we obtain ."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10246832554769606851", "cites_id": ["10246832554769606851"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2001/12/aa10535/aa10535.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w2jzI-sPNI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
