Our partially coherent segmented acceleration search pipeline is designed to enable the discovery of pulsars in short, highly accelerated orbits, while our 72-min integration lengths will allow us to discover pulsars at the lower end of the pulsar luminosity distribution. We report the discovery of 40 pulsars, including three millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binary systems (PSRs J1537\u22125312, J1547\u22125709, and J1618\u22124624), a black-widow binary system (PSR J1745\u221223) and a candidate black-widow binary system (PSR J1727\u22122951), a glitching pulsar (PSR J1706\u22124434), an eclipsing binary pulsar with a 1.5-yr orbital period (PSR J1653\u221245), and a pair of long spin-period binary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1240953217225452666", "cites_id": ["1240953217225452666"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/493/1/1063/5704405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:euyZT2DAOBEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 8}}
