During this period the torque on the neutron star (inferred from the rotational frequency derivative) varied greatly, though much less erratically than during the 2 yr following its discovery in 2009. During the last year of our measurements the frequency derivative decreased in magnitude monotonically by 20%, to a value of\u2212 1.3\u00d7 10\u2212 13 s\u2212 2, a factor of 8 smaller than when it was discovered. The flux density continued to vary greatly during our monitoring through 2014 March, reaching a relatively steady low level after late 2012. The pulse profile varied secularly on a similar timescale as the flux density and torque. A relatively rapid transition in all three properties was evident in early 2013. After PSR J1622\u2212 4950 was detected in all of our 87 observations up to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10577782083798309758", "cites_id": ["10577782083798309758"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa73de/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fhtKAMPUy5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
