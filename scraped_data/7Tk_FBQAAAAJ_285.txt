Such pollution has been detected in a handful of post-supernova binaries, but none of them is associated with a supernova remnant. We report the discovery of a binary G star strongly polluted with calcium and other elements at the position of the candidate neutron star [GV2003] N within the young galactic supernova remnant RCW 86. Our discovery suggests that the progenitor of the supernova that produced RCW 86 could have been a moving star, which exploded near the edge of its wind bubble and lost most of its initial mass because of common-envelope evolution shortly before core collapse, and that the supernova explosion might belong to the class of calcium-rich supernovae \u2014 faint and fast transients,, the origin of which is strongly debated\u2013."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9518424138754676407", "cites_id": ["9518424138754676407"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t9b5y1I8GIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
