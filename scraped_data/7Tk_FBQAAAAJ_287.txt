The radio emission is found to have a complex modulation dominated by a periodicity of \u223c20 times its rotational period P (0.197 s), whose phase and strength depends on pulse longitude. This periodicity exhibits a phase-locked delay of about 2.5P between the main pulse (MP) and interpulse (IP), presumed to be the opposite poles of the pulsar. This delay corresponds to a light-travel distance of many times the light-cylinder radius. More complex modulations are found within the MP on time-scales down to about 9P, and both these and the principal modulation vary strongly across the (at least) seven components which the MP and IP exhibit. The nature of the single pulse emission, which ranges from smooth and longitudinally extended to \u2018spiky\u2019, is also component-dependent.
