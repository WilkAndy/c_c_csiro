The \u03b3-ray source FL8Y J1326. 7\u20134729 is coincident with the core of the cluster, leading to speculation that hitherto unknown radio pulsars or annihilating dark matter may be present in the cluster core. Here we report on the discovery of five millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in Omega Centauri following observations with the Parkes radio telescope. Four of these pulsars are isolated with spin periods of 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, and 6.8 ms. The fifth has a spin period of 4.8 ms and is in an eclipsing binary system with an orbital period of 2.1 hr. Deep radio continuum images of the cluster center with the Australian Telescope Compact Array reveal a small population of compact radio sources, making it likely that other pulsars await discovery. We consider it highly likely that the MSPs are the source of the \u03b3-ray emission.
