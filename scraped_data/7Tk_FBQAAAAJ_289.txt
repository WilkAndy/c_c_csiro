We have used a data base of parameters from 600 pulsars to show that the observed profile width, W, follows W \u221d P\u22120.3 albeit with a large scatter, emission occurs from heights below 400\u2009km and that the beam is underfilled. Furthermore, the prevalence in the data for long-period pulsars to have relatively wide profiles can only be explained if the angle between the magnetic and rotation axis decays with time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Ic1VZgkJnDsC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16128663172927510579", "cites_id": ["16128663172927510579"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/485/1/640/5315779", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M9hE1LOF1N8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
