There was a general increase in the dispersion measure (DM) and scatter-broadening of the pulsar, and a decrease in the flux density towards periastron although fluctuation in these parameters were seen on time-scales as short as minutes. The pulsed emission disappeared 16 d prior to periastron and remained undetectable until 16 d after periastron.The observations are used to determine the parameters of the wind from the Be star. We show that a simple model, in which the wind density varies with radius as r\u22122, provides a good fit to the data. The wind is highly turbulent with an outer scale of \u22641010 cm and an inner scale perhaps as small as 104 cm, a mean density of \u223c106 cm\u22123 and a velocity of \u223c2000 km s\u22121 at a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12055624778190601101", "cites_id": ["12055624778190601101"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/326/2/643/1007140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jbtywdwuTqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
