We report new jitter measurements in 15 of the 29 pulsars in our sample and find that the levels of jitter can vary dramatically between them. For some, like the 2.2 ms pulsar PSR J2241\u22125236, we measure an implied jitter of just \u223c4 ns h\u22121, while others, like the 3.9 ms PSR J0636\u22123044, are limited to \u223c100 ns h\u22121. While it is well known that jitter plays a central role to limiting the precision measurements of arrival times for high signal-to-noise ratio observations, its role in the measurement of dispersion measure (DM) has not been reported, particularly in broad-band observations. Using the exceptional sensitivity of MeerKAT, we explored this on the bright millisecond pulsar PSR J0437\u22124715 by exploring the DM of literally every \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3A3nxV7CjKIC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8574433332760522988", "cites_id": ["8574433332760522988"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/407/6070638", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7LB11a-B_nYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 7}}
