A total of 137 such pulsars are known, with partial overlap between the sources detectable in radio and \u03b3-rays. We use a very small set of assumptions in an attempt to test whether the observed pulsar sample can be explained by a single underlying population of neutron stars. For radio emission we assume a canonical conal beam with a fixed emission height of 300 km across all spin periods and a luminosity law which depends on . For \u03b3-ray emission we assume the outer-gap model and a luminosity law which depends on . We synthesize a population of fast-spinning pulsars with a birth rate of one per 100 yr. We find that this simple model can reproduce most characteristics of the observed population with two caveats. The first is a deficit of \u03b3-ray pulsars at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14575561523819984191", "cites_id": ["14575561523819984191"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/497/2/1957/5873684", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PzUkNfvLRsoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
