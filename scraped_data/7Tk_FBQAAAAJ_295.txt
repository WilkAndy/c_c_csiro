Subsequent observations of this galaxy have revealed that it contains a persistent, but variable, radio source. We present e-Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network, Very Long Baseline Array, and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio observations and Subaru optical observations of WISE J071634.59\u2212190039.2 and find that the persistent radio source is unresolved and must be compact (<0.01 kpc), and that its location is consistent with the optical centre of the galaxy. We conclude that it is likely that WISE J071634.59\u2212190039.2 contains a weak radio active galactic nucleus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11594038893826094019", "cites_id": ["11594038893826094019"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/463/1/L36/2589663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wzORMvJM5qAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 1}}
