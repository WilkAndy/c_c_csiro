It is shown that a steepening of the spectrum (cut-off) may be expected for certain geometrical situations as well as variations in component spectra, e.g. steeper spectra for the central component. These effects appear in addition to the already existing physical variations with frequency."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7743197962518940906", "cites_id": ["7743197962518940906"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/geometrical-effects-on-radio-pulsar-profiles-and-spectra/3FE4337A2B532F33CD71D7D93A74862A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6kx4jYVddWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
