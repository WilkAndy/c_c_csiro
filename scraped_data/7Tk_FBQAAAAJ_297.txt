Observations were carried out with the MeerKAT telescope as part of the Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme in the MeerTime project at frequencies between 0.895 and 1.670 GHz. Our results give a distribution of values for \u03b1 (defined in terms of \u03c4 and frequency \u03bd as \u03c4 \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1) for which, upon fitting a Gaussian, we obtain a mean and standard deviation of <\u03b1> = 4.0 \u00b1 0.6. This is due to our identification of possible causes of inaccurate measurement of \u03c4, which, if not filtered out of modelling results, tend to lead to underestimation of \u03b1. The pulsars in our sample have large dispersion measures and are therefore likely to be distant. We find that a model using an isotropic scatter broadening function is consistent with the data, likely due to the averaging effect of multiple scattering screens along the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8VtEwCQfWZkC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17457102262004554190", "cites_id": ["17457102262004554190"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/504/1/1115/6228876", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zhlz_gMWRPIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
