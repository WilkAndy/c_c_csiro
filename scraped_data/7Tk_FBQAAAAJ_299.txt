The sources exhibit the typical characteristics of \u2018old\u2019 pulsars, with low fractional linear and circular polarization and narrow, multi-component profiles. Although the position angle swings are generally complex, for two of the analysed pulsars (J1622\u22123751 and J1710\u22122616) we obtained an indication of the geometry via the rotating vector model. We were able to determine a value of the rotation measure (RM) for 34 of the sources which, when combined with their dispersion measures (DM), yields an integrated magnetic field strength along the line of sight. With the data presented here, the total number of values of RM associated with pulsars discovered during the HTRU southern survey sums to 51. The RMs are not consistent with the hypothesis of a counter-clockwise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14314829625663798432", "cites_id": ["14314829625663798432"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/436/4/3557/988367", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oLztibN9qMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
