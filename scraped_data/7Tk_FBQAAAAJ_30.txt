We report here on initial Fermi Large Area Telescope observations during verification phase pointed exposure and early sky survey scanning. We have used the Vela signal to verify Fermi timing and angular resolution. The high-quality pulse profile, with some 32,400 pulsed photons at E\u2a7e 0. 03 GeV, shows new features, including pulse structure as fine as 0.3 ms and a distinct third peak, which shifts in phase with energy. We examine the high-energy behavior of the pulsed emission; initial spectra suggest a phase-averaged power-law index of \u0393= 1. 51+ 0. 05\u2212 0. 04 with an exponential cutoff at Ec= 2. 9\u00b10. 1 GeV. Spectral fits with generalized cutoffs of the form e\u2212(E/Ec) b require b\u2a7d 1, which is inconsistent with magnetic pair attenuation, and thus favor outer-magnetosphere emission \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-DxkuPiZhfEC", "num_citations": 217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=362898861813754456", "cites_id": ["362898861813754456"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/696/2/1084/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WGrNk5dGCQUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 38, "2010": 53, "2011": 29, "2012": 11, "2013": 16, "2014": 13, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
