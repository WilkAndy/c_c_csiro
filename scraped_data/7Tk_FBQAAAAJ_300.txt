The observations encompass the supernova remnant (SNR) G312.4-0.4 and the two young pulsars PSRs J1412-6145 and J1413-6141.We derive a lower distance limit of 6 kpc to the SNR, although interpretation of positive velocity features in the Hi spectrum may imply that the SNR is more distant than 14 kpc. PSR J1412-6145, with an age of 50 kyr, is the pulsar most probably associated with SNR G312.4-0.4. X-rays are not detected from either pulsar and diffuse X-ray emission near the bright western edge of the SNR is weak. Although there is circumstantial evidence that this western region is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), the embedded pulsar PSR J1412-6145 is apparently not sufficiently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15817750072797984175", "cites_id": ["15817750072797984175"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/339/4/1048/1006582", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r3UIm-Lvg9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
