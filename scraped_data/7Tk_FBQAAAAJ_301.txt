Polarization profiles and associated parameters are also presented. We derive the geometry for a selection of pulsars which show interpulse emission. We point out that, in several cases, these radio pulsars should also be seen in \u03b3-rays but that improved radio timing is required to aid the high-energy detection. We discuss the relationship between the width of the radio profile and its high-energy detectability. Finally, we reflect on the correlation between the spin-down energy and the radio polarization fraction and the implications this may have for \u03b3-ray emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Vno172sVVMwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7712889959400168648", "cites_id": ["7712889959400168648"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/505/3/4483/6288428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yFy5rY2wCWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
