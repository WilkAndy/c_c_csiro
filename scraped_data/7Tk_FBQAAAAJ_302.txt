We report here on the initial 2 yr of observations with this receiver. Results include dispersion measure (DM) and Faraday rotation measure (RM) variability with time, determined with higher precision than hitherto, flux density measurements and the discovery of several nulling and mode changing pulsars. PSR J1703\u22124851 is shown to be one of a small subclass of pulsars that has a weak and a strong mode which alternate rapidly in time. PSR J1114\u22126100 has the fourth highest |RM| of any known pulsar despite its location far from the Galactic Centre. PSR J1825\u22121446 shows variations in both DM and RM likely due to its motion behind a foreground supernova remnant."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:J3LtWjKFLicC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6082436805653146632", "cites_id": ["6082436805653146632"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/1253/6102525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CKy3cQwoaVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
