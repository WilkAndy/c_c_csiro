Images of the variance of radio signals in both time and frequency can be used to detect pulsars in large-scale continuum surveys using the next generation of synthesis radio telescopes. This technique allows a search over the full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. We investigate the sensitivity of detecting pulsars in variance images. We show that variance images are most sensitive to pulsars whose scintillation time-scales and bandwidths are close to the subintegration time and channel bandwidth. Therefore, in order to maximize the detection of pulsars for a given radio continuum survey, it is essential to retain a high time and frequency resolution, allowing us to make variance images sensitive to pulsars with different scintillation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12325305466023738763", "cites_id": ["12325305466023738763"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/462/3/3115/2589932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i32G4gRIDKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
