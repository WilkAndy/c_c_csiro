Such pulsars represent an important link between classical nullers \u2013 whose emission vanishes for a few rotations \u2013 and the intermittent pulsars which null for months and years. Using the Parkes radio telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we have studied the emission from PSR J1717\u22124054 over intervals from single pulses to years. We have identified and characterized nulling at three discrete time-scales: the pulsar emits during \u2018active states\u2019 separated by nulls lasting many thousands of rotations, while active states themselves are interrupted by nulls with a bimodal distribution of durations \u2013 one to two rotations, or tens of rotations. We detect no sub-pulse structure or flux-density variations during active states, and we place stringent limits (<0.1 per cent of the mean active flux density) on pulsed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14308933740220175428", "cites_id": ["14308933740220175428"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/445/1/320/986747", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RNRsvGyLk8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
