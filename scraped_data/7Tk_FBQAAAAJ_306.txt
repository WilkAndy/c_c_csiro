Here, we demonstrate that the phased array feed can be used for pulsar observations and we highlight some unique capabilities. We demonstrate that the pulse profiles obtained using the phased array feed can be calibrated and that multiple pulsars can be simultaneously observed. Significantly, we find that an intrinsic polarisation leakage of \u221231 dB can be achieved with a phased array feed beam offset from the centre of the field of view. We discuss the possibilities for using a phased array feed for future pulsar observations and for searching for fast radio bursts with the Parkes and Effelsberg telescopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14477249335668167412", "cites_id": ["14477249335668167412"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/observing-pulsars-with-a-phased-array-feed-at-the-parkes-telescope/C0801EA491309547955C678A87A64E40", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9NJCKZGF6cgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
