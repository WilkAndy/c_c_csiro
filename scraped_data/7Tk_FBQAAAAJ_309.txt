For a centre frequency of 1284 MHz, we obtain 762 W10 measurements across the total bandwidth of 775\u2009MHz, where W10 is the width at the 10 per cent level of the pulse peak. We also measure about 400 W10 values in each of the four or eight frequency sub-bands. Assuming, the width is a function of the rotation period P, this relationship can be described with a power law with power law index \u03bc = \u22120.29 \u00b1 0.03. However, using orthogonal distance regression, we determine a steeper power law with \u03bc = \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.06. A density plot of the period-width data reveals such a fit to align well with the contours of highest density. Building on a previous population synthesis model, we obtain population-based estimates of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15193257886963668701", "cites_id": ["15193257886963668701"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/508/3/4249/6380506", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3RZfBY1L2dIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 8, "2023": 8}}
