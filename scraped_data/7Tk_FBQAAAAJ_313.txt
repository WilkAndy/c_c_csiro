No continuum emission is detected from either object with a 3\u03c3 upper limit of 0.2 mJy. The data were also folded synchronously with the known rotation periods of 8.4 and 11.4 s respectively. No pulsed emission was detected. If the pulse duty cycle is small, the upper limit on pulsed emission can be reduced still further to 0.04 mJy. The best evidence seems to indicate that the isolated neutron stars detected by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey are relatively young objects, born with a very high magnetic field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10139482434675116965", "cites_id": ["10139482434675116965"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/340/4/L43/1327724", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pYsflY2ttowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
