Spectropolarimetry of the radio pulses from these objects has the potential to place constraints on their magnetic topology and unveil clues about the magnetar radio emission mechanism. Here, we report on eight observations of the magnetar Swift J1818.0\u20131607 taken with the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low receiver covering a wide frequency range from 0.7 to 4\u2009GHz over a period of 5 months. The magnetar exhibits significant temporal profile evolution over this period, including the emergence of a new profile component with an inverted spectrum, two distinct types of radio emission mode switching, detected during two separate observations, and the appearance and disappearance of multiple polarization modes. These various phenomena are likely a result of ongoing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:lbI08cpqPnQC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1483766634290582838", "cites_id": ["1483766634290582838"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/127/6034003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NpV3fuRllxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
