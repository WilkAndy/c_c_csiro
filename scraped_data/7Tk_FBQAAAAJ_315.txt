The pulsar's X-ray light curve can be fit by the two Gaussian components and the pulsed fraction shows moderate energy dependence over the Chandra band. The pulsed X-ray spectrum is well described by a power law with a photon index 1.16 (4), which is harder than the values measured with RXTE/PCA and NuSTAR. This result supports the log-parabolic model for the broadband X-ray spectrum. With the unprecedented angular resolution of Chandra, we clearly identified off-pulse X-ray emission from the pulsar, and its spectrum is best fit by a power law plus blackbody model. The latter component has a temperature of\u223c 0.14 keV with a bolometric luminosity comparable to the luminosities of other young and high magnetic field RPPs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2512361719308936385", "cites_id": ["2512361719308936385"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa67e3/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:weSyMqyz3SIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
