The study of the \u03b3-ray efficiency of such old pulsars gives us an insight into the evolution of pulsars' ability to emit in \u03b3 rays as they age. The \u03b3-ray light curve of this pulsar above 0.1 GeV is clearly defined by two sharp peaks, 0.353\u00b10.035 periods apart. We have combined the \u03b3-ray profile characteristics of PSR J2043+ 2740 with the geometrical properties of the pulsar's radio emission, derived from radio-polarization data, and constrained the pulsar-beam geometry in the framework of a two-pole caustic (TPC) and an outer gap (OG) model. The ranges of magnetic inclination and viewing angle were determined to be {\u03b1, \u03b6}\u223c{52\u201357, 61\u201368} for the TPC model, and {\u03b1, \u03b6}\u223c{62\u201373, 74\u201381} and {\u03b1, \u03b6}\u223c{72\u201383, 60\u201375} for the OG model. Based on this geometry, we assess possible birth locations for this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5973313687195573211", "cites_id": ["5973313687195573211"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/728/2/77/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:21tFiSZ55VIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
