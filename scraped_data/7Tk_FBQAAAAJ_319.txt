The observations were conducted with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at 1.41 and 4.85 GHz and the Westerbork radio telescope at 352 MHz. For the first time, we present the average profile of the absolute circular polarization |V| in the single pulses. We demonstrate that the average profile of |V| is the distinguishing feature between pulse components that exhibit low V in the single pulses and components that exhibit high V of either handedness, despite both cases resulting in a low mean. We also show that the |V| average profile remains virtually constant with frequency, which is not generally the case for V, leading us to the conclusion that |V| is a key quantity in the pulsar emission problem."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6465104084170548556", "cites_id": ["6465104084170548556"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/344/4/L69/971030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TKXpNOmpuFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 7, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
