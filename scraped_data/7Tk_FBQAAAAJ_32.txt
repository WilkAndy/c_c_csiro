The system comprises a radio pulsar in orbit around a Be star. We report on LAT observations from near apastron to\u223c 128 days after the time of periastron, t p, on 2010 December 15. No \u03b3-ray emission was detected from this source when it was far from periastron. Faint \u03b3-ray emission appeared as the pulsar approached periastron. At\u223c t p+ 30 days, the\u2a7e 100 MeV \u03b3-ray flux increased over a period of a few days to a peak flux 20\u201330 times that seen during the pre-periastron period, but with a softer spectrum. For the following month, it was seen to be variable on daily timescales, but remained at\u223c(1\u20134)\u00d7 10\u2212 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1 before starting to fade at\u223c t p+ 57 days. The total \u03b3-ray luminosity observed during this period is comparable to the spin-down power of the pulsar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 212, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11637444581875283262", "cites_id": ["11637444581875283262"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/736/1/L11/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PnX4ezCCgKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 12, "2012": 31, "2013": 34, "2014": 19, "2015": 20, "2016": 10, "2017": 16, "2018": 19, "2019": 15, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
