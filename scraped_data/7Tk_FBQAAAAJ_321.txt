The wide dispersion measure (DM) range of the pulsar sample and the uniformity of the observing procedure make the data set extremely valuable for studies of flux density variability and the interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we present flux density measurements and modulation indices of these pulsars over this period. We derive the structure function from the light curves and discuss the contributions to it from measurement noise, intrinsic variability, and interstellar scintillation. Despite a large scatter, we show that the modulation index is inversely correlated with DM, and can be generally described by a power law with an index of \u223c\u22120.7 covering DMs from \u223c10 to 1000\u2009cm\u22123\u2009pc. We present refractive time-scales and/or lower limits for a group of 42 pulsars.
