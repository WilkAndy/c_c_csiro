There are only four other pulsars known for which this phenomenon is observed. PSR B0031\u201307 is unique, as it is the only source in this group which has multiple stable drift modes. For both drift modes visible at our observing frequency centred at 1369 MHz, the modulation of polarization modes is synchronous with the drifting sub-pulses. In one of the drift modes, a discontinuity in the modulation pattern of polarization properties occurs halfway through the pulse, coinciding with a slight change in the slope of the intensity drift band. In contrast to what has been suggested for this pulsar in the past, this, plus other differences in the polarization of the modulated emission observed for the two drift modes, suggests that a drift mode change is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5863546215334498726", "cites_id": ["5863546215334498726"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/491/3/3385/5637391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:plEZaTeAX1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
