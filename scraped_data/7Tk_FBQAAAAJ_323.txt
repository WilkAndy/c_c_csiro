We also present timing solutions for the new discoveries and for 19 further pulsars for which only discovery parameters were previously published. Highlights of the presented sample include the isolated millisecond pulsar J1826\u22122415, the long-period binary pulsar J1837\u22120822 in a mildly eccentric 98-d orbit with a >0.27 M\u2299 companion, and the nulling pulsar J1638\u22124233, detected only 10 per\u2009cent of the time. Other interesting objects are PSR J1757\u22121500, exhibiting sporadic mode changes, and PSR J1635\u22122616 showing one glitch over 6 yr. The new discoveries bring the total count of HTRU intermediate-latitude pulsars to 113, 25 per\u2009cent of which are recycled pulsars. This is the highest ratio of recycled over ordinary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=666901490291838494", "cites_id": ["666901490291838494"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/484/4/5791/5315792", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hg4GPV9PQQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
