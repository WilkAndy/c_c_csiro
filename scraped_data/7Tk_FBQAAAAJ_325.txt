We have searched for previously undetected radio pulsations (both giant and standard) from this pulsar in a 12-h observation taken at 1400MHz with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. The very large value of the magnetic field at the light cylinder radius suggests that this pulsar might be emitting giant radio pulses like those seen in other pulsars with similar field strengths. No radio emission of either kind was detected from the pulsar, and we have established an upper limit of \u223c25mJykpc2 for the average 1400-MHz radio luminosity of PSR J0537\u22126910. The 5\u03c3 single-pulse detection threshold was \u223c750mJy for a single 80-\u03bcs sample. These limits are likely to be the best obtainable until searches with greatly improved sensitivity can be made with next-generation radio instruments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12592519409102759029", "cites_id": ["12592519409102759029"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117705003601", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dSTIPq-dwa4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2}}
