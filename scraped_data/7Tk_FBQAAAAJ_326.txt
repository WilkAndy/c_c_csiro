Variance imaging with future radio continuum surveys allows us to identify radio pulsars and serves as a complement to conventional pulsar searches that are most sensitive to strictly periodic signals. Here, we carry out simulations to predict the number of pulsars that we can uncover with variance imaging in future continuum surveys. We show that the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey can find \u223c30 normal pulsars and \u223c40 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) over and above the number known today, and similarly an all-sky continuum survey with SKA-MID can discover \u223c140 normal pulsars and \u223c110 MSPs with this technique. Variance imaging with EMU and SKA-MID will detect pulsars with large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13864679339611616393", "cites_id": ["13864679339611616393"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/472/2/1458/4082090", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iXQ_smY8acAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
