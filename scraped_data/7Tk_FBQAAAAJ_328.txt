Following the detection at the VLA by Fruchter and Goss of a steep-spectrum source located within 10\" of the cluster center and having a 20-cm flux density of 1.3 mJy, a pulsar was detected in 20-cm observations made with the Parkes radiotelescope on Nov. 7 and confirmed in observations made the next day with the same system. It was also detected in analysis of 50-cm observations made in July. The heliocentric pulse period is 288.60 ms and the dispersion measure is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6182854745361900719", "cites_id": ["6182854745361900719"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989IAUC.4905....2M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r2Qi-6HpzVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
