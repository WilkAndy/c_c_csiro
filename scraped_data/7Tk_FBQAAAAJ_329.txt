The science goals for the programme include timing millisecond pulsar (MSPs) to high precision ( ) to study the Galactic MSP population and to contribute to global efforts to detect nanohertz gravitational waves with the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). In order to plan for the remainder of the programme and to use the allocated time most efficiently, we have conducted an initial census with the MeerKAT \u2018L-band\u2019 receiver of 189 MSPs visible to MeerKAT and here present their dispersion measures, polarisation profiles, polarisation fractions, rotation measures, flux density measurements, spectral indices, and timing potential. As all of these observations are taken with the same instrument (which uses coherent dedispersion, interferometric polarisation calibration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:zzCxg_vo7cAC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8765715798313118860", "cites_id": ["8765715798313118860"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/meertime-pulsar-timing-array-a-census-of-emission-properties-and-timing-potential/FD7806FFFDC44873120FE8E53D8EAFF0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jKx7aBMUpnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 8}}
