Popular theories,,, of the emission mechanism require continuous electron\u2013positron pair production, with the potential responsible for accelerating the particles being inversely related to the spin period. Pair production will stop when the potential drops below a threshold, so the models predict that radio emission will cease when the period exceeds a value that depends on the magnetic field strength and configuration. Here we show that the pulsar J2144\u22123933, previously thought to have a period of 2.84\u2009s, actually has a period of 8.51\u2009s, which is by far the longest of any known radio pulsar. Moreover, under the usual model assumptions, based on the neutron-star equations of state, this slowly rotating pulsar should not be emitting a radio beam. Therefore either the model assumptions are wrong, or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18021397181444765265", "cites_id": ["18021397181444765265"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/23650", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UbY9TEHdGPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 13, "2001": 18, "2002": 8, "2003": 10, "2004": 6, "2005": 8, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 13, "2010": 11, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 14, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
