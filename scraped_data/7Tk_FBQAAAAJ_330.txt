After spending almost a decade in a quiescent, radio-silent state, the magnetar was reported to have undergone a radio outburst in 2018 December. We observed radio pulsations from XTE J1810\u2212 197 during this early phase of its radio revival using the Ultra-Wideband Low receiver system of the Parkes radio telescope, obtaining wideband (704\u20134032 MHz) polarization pulse profiles, single pulses, and flux density measurements. Dramatic changes in polarization and rapid variations of the position angle of linear polarization across the main pulse and in time have been observed. The pulse profile exhibits similar structures throughout our three observations (over a week timescale), displaying a small amount of profile evolution in terms of polarization and pulse width across the wideband. We measured a flat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16317604780859099629", "cites_id": ["16317604780859099629"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0e7a/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7YlSBBjHc-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
