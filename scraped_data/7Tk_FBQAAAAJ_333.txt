This frequency dependence is key to the emission mechanism and the structure of the radio beam. With the new ultra-wideband receiver (UWL) on the Parkes radio telescope we are able, for the first time, to observe how pulsar profiles evolve over a broad continuous bandwidth of 700\u20134000\u2009MHz. We describe here a technique for processing broad-band polarimetric observations to establish a meaningful alignment and visualize the data across the band. We apply this to observations of PSRs J1056\u20136258 and J1359\u20136038, chosen due to previously unresolved questions about the frequency evolution of their emission. Application of our technique reveals that it is possible to align the polarization position angle (PA) across a broad frequency range when constrained to applying only corrections for dispersion and Faraday rotation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:RMgMIBzvq-4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2629223635743123311", "cites_id": ["2629223635743123311"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/496/2/1418/5855054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b6eHa_fgfCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
