A second case of measles in a staff member was confirmed by rPCR the next day. The privately operated, city-contracted facility housed 1,425 detainees, and employed 510 staff members, including 95 federal ICE staff and 415 contract staff of four distinct employers. Outbreak control measures consisted of administration of measlesmumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to 1,424 detainees housed at the facility during May 29\u201331 and isolation of the detainee patient and any additional detainee patients identified during their remaining infectious period (until 4 days after rash onset). Recommendations were made by federal, state, and local public health \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16486258164892373589", "cites_id": ["16486258164892373589"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5657873/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VRLL-XP0yuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
