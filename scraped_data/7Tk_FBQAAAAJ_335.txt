These data are analysed here in terms of two superposed wave populations, using a new calculation for the amplitude statistics of two vectorially combined transverse fields. Detailed analyses show that the approximately power-law and lognormal distributions observed are well fitted at essentially all on-pulse phases by Gaussian\u2013lognormal and double-lognormal combinations, respectively. The good fits found, plus the smooth but significant variations in fitting parameters across the source, provide strong evidence that the approximately power-law statistics observed in the transition region are not intrinsic.
