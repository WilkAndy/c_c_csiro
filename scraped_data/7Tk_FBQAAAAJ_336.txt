Data up to 2017 September 21 have been searched using standard Fourier techniques, single-pulse searches, and Fast Folding Algorithm searches. We present 19 new discoveries, bringing the total to 27 discoveries in the programme, and we report the results of follow-up timing observations at Parkes for 26 of these pulsars, including the millisecond pulsar PSR J1421\u22124409; the faint, highly modulated, slow pulsar PSR J1646\u22121910; and the nulling pulsar PSR J1337\u22124441. We present new timing solutions for 23 pulsars, and we report flux densities, modulation indices, and polarization properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:rLGzs9wiiwIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5440880295815462580", "cites_id": ["5440880295815462580"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/496/4/4836/5863967", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tL6AUc3jgUsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
