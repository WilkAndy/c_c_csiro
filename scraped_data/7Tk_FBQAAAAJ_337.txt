The observer\u2019s view of pulsar emission is a 1D cut through a 3D magnetosphere: we can only see that emission which points along our line of sight. However, by comparing the frequency evolution of many single pulses positioned at different phases, we can build up an understanding of the shape of the active emission region. We use single pulses observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to investigate the emission region of PSR J1136+1551 and test RFM. Assuming that emission is produced tangential to the magnetic field lines and that each emission frequency corresponds to a single height, we simulate the single pulse profile evolution resulting from the canonical conal beam model and a fan \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:2vr6o8x5NLkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12769148769582235885", "cites_id": ["12769148769582235885"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/489/1/310/5542736", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7cAQ7yYhNbEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
