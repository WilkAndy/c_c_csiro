Here, we outline the state of the art of our understanding of magnetospheric radio emission from pulsars and how we will use the SKA to solve the open problems in pulsar magnetospheric physics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9073832715371312173", "cites_id": ["9073832715371312173"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LXQGh8e67H0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
