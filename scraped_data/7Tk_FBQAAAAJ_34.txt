This, the second known eclipsing binary pulsar after PSR1957 + 20, has a pulse period of 11.56 ms and a very short orbital period of 1.8 hours. In contrast to PSR1957 + 20, where the eclipses occupy about 10 per cent of the orbital period1, the eclipse duration in this pulsar is very variable and never less than one-third of the orbital period. The pulsar is in a circular orbit of radius 0.11 light seconds, which implies a minimum companion mass of 0.089 solar masses, about four times the companion mass of PSR1957 + 20. Timing observations suggest an identification of the pulsar with a variable continuum source locate about 30 arcsec west of the cluster centre. These observations and the variable eclipse duration show that the eclipse is due to absorption or scattering in a tenuous wind which flows from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10035518462204258953", "cites_id": ["10035518462204258953"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/347650a0.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iSqP9N5SRYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 17, "1992": 25, "1993": 25, "1994": 9, "1995": 12, "1996": 7, "1997": 3, "1998": 9, "1999": 2, "2000": 11, "2001": 8, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
