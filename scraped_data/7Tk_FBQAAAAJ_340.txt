Based on very large array and MPIfR Effelsberg telescope data, we analyzed a 40\u2032\u00d740\u2032 field around Geminga. These observations have revealed the presence of a neutral gas shell, 0.4pc in radius, with an associated HI mass of 0.8M\u2299, which surrounds Geminga at a radial velocity compatible with the kinematical distance of the neutron star. In addition, morphological agreement is observed between the internal face of the HI shell and the brightest structure of Geminga\u2019s tail observed in X-rays. We explore the possibility that this morphological agreement is the result of a physical association."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9299038719480273286", "cites_id": ["9299038719480273286"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117705002085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hpk5a3LSDIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 2}}
