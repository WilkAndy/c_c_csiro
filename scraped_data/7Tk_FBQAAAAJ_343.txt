Independent of the underlying mechanism, glitches result in a near instantaneous increase in the observed spin frequency and are sometimes associated with a change in spin-down. Occasionally, the change in spin frequency is observed to exponentially recover toward the pre-glitch value. Studies of large catalogues of glitches have provided insights to the internal dynamics of neutron stars and the behaviour of matter under super-nuclear densities (eg Yu et al. 2013).We report the first detection of a glitch in the radio pulsar PSR J0908\u2212 4913 (PSR B0906\u2212 49) during regular timing observations by the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) as part of the UTMOST \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17507312922053603981", "cites_id": ["17507312922053603981"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ab621d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jXKcSlh49vIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
