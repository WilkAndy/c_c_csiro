We, herein, investigated the biological and clinical significance of RAPH1 in breast cancer using large annotated cohorts.The clinicopathological and prognostic significance of RAPH1 was assessed at the genomic and transcriptomic levels using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (n\u2009=\u20091039) and the results were validated using the Molecular taxonomy of breast cancer international consortium (METABRIC) cohort (n\u2009=\u20091980). RAPH1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a large, well-characterised cohort of early-stage breast cancer (n\u2009=\u20091040 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17386063044743435433", "cites_id": ["17386063044743435433"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-018-4891-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qZR6UDm0R_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
