Subsequently, science priorities for ATNF telescopes in general and ASKAP in particular were presented in ATNF Science in 2010-2015 by Ball et al.(2008) and this priority listing strongly influenced the configuration decision. Input from the community at large and the ASKAP Science Working Group were also taken into consideration. An initial discussion paper for ASKAP configurations was given by Feain et al.(2008) with the technical studies presented in Gupta et al.(2008). We recommended that the best initial option for the configuration was a hybrid array optimised for the Hi emission surveys. The overall ASKAP budget envelope has since established that the initial configuration will consist of 36 antennas. The configuration derived in this paper has 30 of the antennas arranged within a circle of diameter\u223c 2 km, with a further 6 antennas arranged to form a Reuleaux triangle with maximum separation of\u223c 6 km. The configuration takes into account a mask of the site at the Murchison Radio Observatory. The initial ASKAP configuration is optimised to produce excellent sensitivity and a good point spread function (sidelobe levels 2-3%) at an angular resolution of 30\u201d at 1.4 GHz. The configuration also provides high survey speed at an angular resolution of 10\u201d and good surface brightness sensitivity at angular resolutions of 60\u201d and 90\u201d. We expect that this configuration will return excellent science outcomes for ASKAP for at least the first five years of its operation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6881803009533126318", "cites_id": ["6881803009533126318"], "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/newdocs/configs-3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rqZvNWATgV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
