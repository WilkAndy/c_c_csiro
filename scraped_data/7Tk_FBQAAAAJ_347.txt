Despite this long tradition in pulsar astronomy, with vigorous theoretical and observational groups working in the field, up to 1995 Australia had never hosted a conference on this topic. Thus IAU Colloquium 160 \u201cPulsars: Problems and Progress\u201d, held at the University of Sydney from the 8th\u201312th January 1996, was, if nothing else, due.
