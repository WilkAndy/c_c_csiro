It exhibits intraday variability in its flux density at GHz frequencies attributed to scintillations from plasma inhomogeneities. We have tracked the rate of scintillation of this source for over a year with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, recording a strong annual cycle that includes a near-standstill in August and another in December. The cycle is consistent with scattering by highly anisotropic plasma microstructure, and we fit our data to that model in order to determine the kinematic parameters of the plasma. Because of the low-ecliptic latitude of PKS B1322\u2013110\u2009, the orientation of the plasma microstructure is poorly constrained. None the less at each possible orientation our data single out a narrow range of the corresponding velocity component, leading to a one-dimensional constraint in a two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:yY3RG6sOEgwC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15123261466115919599", "cites_id": ["15123261466115919599"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/487/3/4372/5512609", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:704xTS2e4NEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
