Data spans for each pulsar ranged between 5.3 and 20.8\u2009yr. From the total of 1911\u2009yr of pulsar rotational history, 107 glitches were identified in 36 pulsars. Out of these glitches, 61 have previously been reported whereas 46 are new discoveries. Glitch parameters, both for the previously known and the new glitch detections, were measured by fitting the timing residual data. Observed relative glitch sizes \u0394\u03bdg/\u03bd range between 10\u221210 and 10\u22125, where \u03bd = 1/P is the pulse frequency. We confirm that the distribution of \u0394\u03bdg/\u03bd is bimodal with peaks at approximately 10\u22129 and 10\u22126. Glitches are mostly observed in pulsars with characteristic ages between 103 and 105\u2009yr, with large glitches mostly occurring in the younger pulsars. Exponential post-glitch recoveries were observed for 27 large glitches in 18 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6767059544307823014", "cites_id": ["6767059544307823014"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/429/1/688/1025310", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pnFiWM1s6V0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 15, "2015": 25, "2016": 17, "2017": 32, "2018": 19, "2019": 17, "2020": 25, "2021": 19, "2022": 21, "2023": 8}}
