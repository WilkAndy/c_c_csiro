The configurations are constrained by the land available at the Murchison Radio Observatory, a mask of unsuitable locations within the site, and the budget for the backend computing.We concentrate on options available for a 45 antenna system. We present optimised configurations resulting in a 60, 30 and 10 synthesised beam, spatial scales which are most suitable for low-surface brightness science, an extragalactic Hi emission survey and a continuum survey respectively. We then examine various hybrid and scale-free options in an attempt to provide an array suitable for all science cases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16891821074731632144", "cites_id": ["16891821074731632144"], "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/newdocs/ng_config.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EAbWUMXNa-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
