The pulsar has a period of 23.10 ms, dispersion measure of 187+/-2 cmE-3 pc and 20-cm flux density of 0.8 mJy. It is in an orbit of period 2.62 days and eccentricity 0.22 with a mass function of 0.0097 solar mass. Within the uncertainties, the 20-cm flux density of the pulsar is equal to those of two continuum sources detected at the Very Large Array and located within 40\" of the cluster center. The source closer to the cluster center has shown \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5162671145298977401", "cites_id": ["5162671145298977401"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990IAUC.5013....1D/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eWK0uw1-pUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 4, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
