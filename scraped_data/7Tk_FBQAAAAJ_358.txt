Assuming that effective ploidy barriers in the endosperm could exist between diploid species, an endosperm balance number (EBN) of 2 has been assigned to 2x S. verrucosum. Thus 2x S. cardiophyllum must have an EBN of 1 and since it crosses readily with the non-tuber-bearing species S. fernandezianum the species of series Etuberosa must also have an EBN of 1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kO05sadLmrgC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5039579777603356970", "cites_id": ["5039579777603356970"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19811603814", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KklKXRsv8EUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
