We present the timing models, light curves, and detailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. PSRs J1023\u20135746, J1044\u20135737, J1413\u20135205, J1429\u20135911, and J1954+ 2836 are young (\u03c4 c< 100 kyr), energetic ( erg s\u2212 1), and located within the Galactic plane (| b|< 3). The remaining three pulsars, PSRs J1846+ 0919, J1957+ 5033, and J2055+ 25, are less energetic, and located off the plane. Five pulsars are associated with sources included in the Fermi-LAT bright \u03b3-ray source list, but only one, PSR J1413\u2212 6205, is clearly associated with an EGRET source. PSR J1023\u2212 5746 has the smallest characteristic age (\u03c4 c= 4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic ( erg s\u2212 1) of all \u03b3-ray pulsars discovered so far in blind \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 204, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15289988663499686865", "cites_id": ["15289988663499686865"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/725/1/571/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0QOm-63zMNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 9, "2011": 41, "2012": 32, "2013": 20, "2014": 19, "2015": 14, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 12, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
