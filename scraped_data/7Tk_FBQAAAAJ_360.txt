The pulsars were found during reprocessing of archival survey data by Mickaliger et al. One of the new pulsars (PSR J1546\u20135925) has a spin period P = 7.8\u2009ms and is isolated. The other two (PSR J0921\u20135202 with P = 9.7\u2009ms and PSR J1146\u20136610 with P = 3.7\u2009ms) are in binary systems around low-mass () companions. Their respective orbital periods are 38.2 and 62.8\u2009d. While PSR J0921\u20135202 has a low orbital eccentricity e = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125, in keeping with many other Galactic MSPs, PSR J1146\u20136610 has a significantly larger eccentricity, e = 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22123. This makes it a likely member of a group of eccentric MSP\u2013helium white dwarf binary systems in the Galactic disc whose formation is poorly understood. Two of the pulsars are co-located \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:c1AJUTjuCtUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15132801749409503456", "cites_id": ["15132801749409503456"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/4/5303/6362610", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4Jj2mQODAtIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
