Here, we present evidence that the pulsar is located at the edge of a previously unknown, filled-centre supernova remnant (SNR), G270.4\u20131.0. The velocity vector of the pulsar points directly away from the centre of the remnant. The putative association of the pulsar with SNR G270.4\u20131.0 implies the pulsar is \u223c12 kyr old, significantly less than its characteristic age of 110 kyr. We show that the rotation axis of the pulsar points in the direction of the proper motion. Rotation measure and dispersion measure variations are seen over time, likely indicating the pulsar is passing behind a filament of the remnant."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DquSII9TDu4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16798784618410754539", "cites_id": ["16798784618410754539"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/507/1/L41/6342162", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:60GrTptFIekJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
