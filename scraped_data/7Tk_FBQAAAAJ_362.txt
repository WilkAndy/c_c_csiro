Here we define the adopted observing strategy, which guarantees that each target is observed long enough to obtain a high-fidelity pulse profile, thereby reaching a sufficient precision of a simple pulse shape parameter. This precision is estimated from the contribution of the system noise of the telescope, and the pulse-to-pulse variability of each pulsar, which we quantify under some simplifying assumptions. We test the assumptions and choice of model parameters using data from the MeerKAT 64-dish array and the Lovell and Parkes telescopes. We demonstrate that the observing times derived from our method produce high-fidelity pulse profiles that meet the needs of the TPA in studying pulse shape variability and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Y9VhQm-5nPIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11279585646507936397", "cites_id": ["11279585646507936397"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/505/3/4456/6288432", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jUqzOWIjiZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
