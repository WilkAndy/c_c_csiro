The observations were dedicated to the search of the radio counterpart of the evolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN) HESS\u2009J1303\u2212631, which has been detected in X-rays and GeV\u2013TeV \u03b3-rays. The collected data do not reveal any significant extended emission associated with PSR\u2009J1301\u22126305. In addition, archival 1.384 GHz and 2.368 GHz data do not show any evidence for a radio counterpart of HESS\u2009J1303\u2212631. Archival 1.384 GHz observations reveal the detection of an extended structure centred at an angular distance of 19\u2032 from the pulsar. This extended structure might be a supernova remnant (SNR) and a potential birth place of PSR\u2009J1301\u22126305.
