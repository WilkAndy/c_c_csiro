Radio observations using the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array at 36, 16, 6, and 3 cm reveal a complex morphology. The pulsar is embedded in the\" head\" of the nebula with fan-shaped diffuse emission. This is connected to a circular bubble of 20''radius and a collimated tail extending over 1'. Polarization measurements show a highly ordered magnetic field in the nebula. It wraps around the edge of the head and shows an azimuthal configuration near the pulsar, then switches direction quasi-periodically near the bubble and in the tail. Together with the flat radio spectrum observed, we suggest that this system is most plausibly a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), with the head as a bow shock that has a low Mach number and the bubble as a shell expanding in a dense \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:IaI1MmNe2tcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2822663814596404615,17633043723267150833", "cites_id": ["2822663814596404615", "17633043723267150833"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa762e/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hyVexcgdLCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
