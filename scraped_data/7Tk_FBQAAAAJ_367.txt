Observations were made of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G328.8+0.2. We find the SNR has circular morphology with a strong central bar, similar to that seen at lower frequencies. The SNR has high linear polarization throughout, with fractional polarization in the bar up to 50 per cent. The orientation of the magnetic field lines follow the filamentary structure of the SNR. The magnetic field at the edge of the SNR is generally toroidal, interspersed with radial fingers, likely caused by Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilities. Although the SNR has been identified as Crab-like, we prefer an interpretation in which the bar is a pulsar-powered wind nebula with the rest of the SNR consisting of the shell. The proposed pulsar parameters make the SNR/pulsar system more like SNR G11.2\u20130.3 than the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14186180882490686851", "cites_id": ["14186180882490686851"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/348/2/L19/985218", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g31L3Flw38QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
