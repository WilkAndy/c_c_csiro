PSR J2144\u20133933, previously thought to have a period of 2.84 s, actually has a period of 8.51 s. Under the usual assumptions about the stellar equation of state, this pulsar has an average surface dipolar magnetic field strength of ~ 2.0 \u00d7 1012G. According to popular theories of the emission mechanism this pulsar should not be emitting radio waves because its long period and magnetic field strength make pair creation impossible for all reasonable magnetic field configurations. Either assumptions about the equation of state are incorrect, or the emission theories must be revised."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7390941384869971463", "cites_id": ["7390941384869971463"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/ha-ha-ha-ha-staying-alive-staying-alive-a-radio-pulsar-with-an-85s-period-challenges-emission-models/71B43E9501B89170A6D81E1871902847", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:B4bo2AfmkWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
