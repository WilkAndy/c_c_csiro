Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and their propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as cosmological probes. We report on a mildly dispersed (dispersion measure 266.5 \u00b1 0.1 parsecs per cubic centimeter), exceptionally intense (120 \u00b1 30 janskys), linearly polarized, scintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 square arc minutes. On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 \u00b1 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible magnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight. The burst scintillation suggests weak turbulence in the ionized intergalactic medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1596282668493931090", "cites_id": ["1596282668493931090"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf6807", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UoKxKKEiJxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 33, "2018": 41, "2019": 47, "2020": 32, "2021": 23, "2022": 17, "2023": 4}}
