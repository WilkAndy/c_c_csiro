The detection was made in the Band-3 frequency range (85\u2013101 GHz) using ALMA in the phased-array mode developed for VLBI observations. A software pipeline has been implemented to enable a regular pulsar observing mode in the future. We describe the pipeline and demonstrate the capability of ALMA to perform pulsar timing and searching. We also measure the flux density and polarization properties of the Vela pulsar (PSR J0835\u20134510) at millimeter wavelengths, providing the first polarimetric study of any ordinary pulsar at frequencies above 32 GHz. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from the Vela observations for future pulsar studies with ALMA, particularly for searches near the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center, and the potential of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=247818403413543786", "cites_id": ["247818403413543786"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab4da8/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:astEYIZtcAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
