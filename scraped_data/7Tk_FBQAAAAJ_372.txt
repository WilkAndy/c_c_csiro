However, it is not yet known if long- and short-term emission variability are caused by the same physical processes. It has been observed that long-term emission variability is often correlated with rotational changes in the pulsar. We do not yet know if the same is true of short-term emission variability, as the rotational changes involved cannot be directly measured over such short time-scales. To remedy this, we propose a continuous pulsar monitoring technique that permits the statistical detection of any rotational changes in nulling and mode-changing pulsars with certain properties. Using a simulation, we explore the range of pulsar properties over which such an experiment would be possible."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5175103956016676809", "cites_id": ["5175103956016676809"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/488/4/5702/5542236", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yb8XDqGp0UcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
