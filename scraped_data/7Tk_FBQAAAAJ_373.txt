It powers a compact pulsar wind nebula with a jet visible in X-rays and a large-scale plerion detected in X-ray and TeV ranges. Previous multiwavelength studies suggested that the pulsar has a significant proper motion of about 180 mas yr\u22121, implying an extremely high transverse velocity of about 2000 km s\u22121. In order to verify this, we performed radio-interferometric observations of PSR J1357\u22126429 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the 2.1-GHz band. We detected the pulsar with a mean flux density of 212 \u00b1 5 \u03bcJy and obtained the most accurate pulsar position: RA = , Dec. = \u221264\u00b029\u20322989(15). Using both new and archival ATCA data, we did not find any proper motion and estimated its 90 per cent upper limit as \u03bc < 106 mas yr\u22121. The pulsar shows a highly polarized single pulse, as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DkZNVXde3BIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12585304690699100694", "cites_id": ["12585304690699100694"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/452/3/3273/1078312", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FmItt-_7p64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
