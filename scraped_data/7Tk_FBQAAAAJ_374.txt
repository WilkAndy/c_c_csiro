This changes the measured gamma-ray to radio lag (\u03b4) to 0.11\u00b10.01. An error was also made in the off-pulse phase range in Table 3 for that pulsar. This error did not affect the spectral results. Corrected versions of Table 3 (with the revised numbers in bold face), Figure 4, and Figure A20 are included here. In addition, there was an error in the caption to Figure 9. The figure with corrected caption is included here, with the changed word in bold face."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:N4u4nq0IxgcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14701162811675856561", "cites_id": ["14701162811675856561"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/193/1/22/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sU4f568FBcwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
