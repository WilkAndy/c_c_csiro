Although several supernova remnants are positionally coincident with these sources, we find no X-ray evidence of high energy particle production in SNR shell shocks consistent with the GeV positions. We also present initial results from follow on radio imaging studies of several fields containing unidentified sources. We have discovered new X-ray/radio nebulae in three of these fields which are strong candidates for PWN. These sources, along with a the PWN around PSR B1853--01 in W44, are all positionally coincident with variable EGRET sources. This suggests a class of variable y-ray sources associated with synchrotron emitting regions powered by the winds of young pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15246187226103388828", "cites_id": ["15246187226103388828"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QlHtCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA135&dq=info:nJr9HoFWldMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=mPmB3xVy-X&sig=mKpPEYubOBGHqdvdB0TR7wDy87Y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nJr9HoFWldMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
