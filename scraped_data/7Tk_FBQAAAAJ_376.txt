We obtain a decorrelation bandwidth of vd = 244\u00b14 Hz and diffractive decorrelation timescale of tdiff = 3.3\u00b10.3s. Our measurement of the modulation indices m = 0.87\u00b10.003\u00b10.05 and m = 0.93\u00b10.03\u00b10.05 (one For each polarization stream), are at variance with the modulation index of the Vela pulsar obtained at 2.3 GHz by Gwinn et al. (F997) if the deviation from a modulation index of unity is ascribed to a source size effect."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7023448493840675878", "cites_id": ["7023448493840675878"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/nanoarcsecond-singledish-imaging-of-the-vela-pulsar/3AEA02C06FC4E7580A785D16084FE2B7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JjSgfTFNeGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1}}
