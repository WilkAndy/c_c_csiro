Using contemporaneous timing solutions, upper limits on pulsed emission were obtained for 350 pulsars. Limits to unpulsed gamma radiation were obtained for all cataloged pulsars. No new detections were found, although there is evidence for localized excesses at the positions of a few of these pulsars. No correlation was however found between \u0307 (E)/d^ 2^ and the sources of such unpulsed excesses. A number of models predict the \u03b3-ray luminosity from pulsars as a function of measurable pulsar parameters. The functional form of models are tested for the six detected pulsars above 100MeV and we find that the luminosity does not scale with the pulsar parameters as predicted. Furthermore, some flux upper limits contradict the model predictions, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18059219184268864328", "cites_id": ["18059219184268864328"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996A%26AS..120C..89N", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SOtDjyo8n_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
