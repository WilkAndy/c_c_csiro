Until now, all DNS systems in wide orbits (Porb > 1\u2009d) have been found to have orbital eccentricities, e > 0.1. In this paper, we report the discovery of pulsar PSR J1325\u22126253: a DNS system in a 1.81-d orbit with a surprisingly low eccentricity of just e = 0.064. Through, 1.4 yr of dedicated timing with the Parkes radio telescope we have been able to measure its rate of advance of periastron, . If this induced  is solely due to general relativity then the total mass of the system is, Msys = 2.57 \u00b1 0.06\u2009M\u2299. Assuming an edge-on orbit the minimum companion mass is constrained to be Mc, min > 0.98 M\u2299 which implies the pulsar mass is Mp, max < 1.59 M\u2299. Its location in the P\u2013 diagram suggests that, like other DNS systems, PSR J1325 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:sJK75vZXtG0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7436087209418721162", "cites_id": ["7436087209418721162"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/512/4/5782/6553848", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ioc6POtJMmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
