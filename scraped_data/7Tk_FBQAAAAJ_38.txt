The two are in a highly eccentric orbit of period 3.4 yr. Radio observations over 1250 days with the Parkes radio telescope now permit a phase-connected solution, which shows that' the next periastron is expected to occur on 1994 January 9.2 ut, and that the pulsar has a period derivative of . The pulsar thus has a characteristic age of 0.33 Myr and a surface magnetic field strength of . Optical photometry of SS 2883 shows that the star is of spectral type of about B2e, indicating its mass to be  and its radius . The system can be no further than 1.5 kpc distant, substantially closer than the distance derived from the dispersion measure. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Balmer-series emission lines allows a determination of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16030455557306758124", "cites_id": ["16030455557306758124"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/268/2/430/1052166", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7LP0eGWed94J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 15, "1996": 7, "1997": 7, "1998": 8, "1999": 12, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 16, "2012": 14, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
