Based on its high latitude (b= 98) and dispersion measure (DM= 143 pc cm\u2212 3), the pulsar appears to be at a z-height of> 1 kpc above the Galactic plane, but near the edge of our Galaxy. This is many times the observed scale height of the canonical pulsar population, which suggests this pulsar may have been born far out of the plane. If accurate, the young age and high z-height imply that this is the first pulsar known to be born from a runaway O/B star. In follow-up imaging with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we detect the pulsar with a flux density S 1400= 0.18\u00b10.05 mJy. We do not detect an obvious supernova remnant around the pulsar in our ATCA data, but we detect a colocated, low-surface-brightness region of\u223c 15 extent in archival Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey data. We also detect \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:uUvzmPk0f8oC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3280847947011170826", "cites_id": ["3280847947011170826"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe70d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CqKrO9Pphy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
