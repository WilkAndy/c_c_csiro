Our data, taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, show large variations in the amplitude and shape of its spectrum, on a short time-scale. A great variety of spectral features is evident, including sharp kinks, broad spectral peaks and wiggles. No two spectra are alike. We interpret the variations as interstellar scintillation of a radio source that is compact, but not point-like. Under this interpretation, complex spectral structure can arise purely refractively, under high magnification conditions, or from interference between waves that have been scattered by small-scale density fluctuations (diffractive scintillation). Both effects may be playing a role in J1106\u22123647, and we tentatively identify kinks with the former, and wiggles with the latter. Diffractive scintillation of active galactic nuclei is uncommon, as the fringe visibility is low for all but the most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6743825669759513437", "cites_id": ["6743825669759513437"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/469/4/5023/3833255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XTMtYbfhll0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
