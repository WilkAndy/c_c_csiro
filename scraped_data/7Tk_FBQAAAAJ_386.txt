We find that the simultaneous INTEGRAL and HESS data permit both a model with dominant radiative losses, high pulsar wind Lorentz factor and modest efficiency as well as one with dominant adiabatic losses, a slower wind and higher efficiency. Additional, simultaneous, X-ray and TeV data sets are needed to lift this degeneracy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16028698107543996137", "cites_id": ["16028698107543996137"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005ICRC....4..131K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6cYiUAFgcd4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1}}
