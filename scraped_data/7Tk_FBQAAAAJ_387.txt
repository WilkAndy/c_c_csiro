Scintillation arcs appear to be ubiquitous in clean, high S/N observations, their detection mainly limited by short observing durations and coarse frequency channel resolution. This led the survey to be sensitive to nearby, lightly scattered pulsars with high effective velocity \u2013 from a large proper motion, a screen nearby the pulsar, or a screen near the Earth. We measure the arc curvatures in all of our sources, which can be used to give an estimate of screen distances in pulsars with known proper motion, or an estimate of the proper motion. The short scintillation time-scale in J1731\u22124744 implies a scattering screen within 12\u2009pc of the source, strongly suggesting the association between this pulsar and the supernova remnant RCW 114.
