The commissioning phase has started in mid 2022. The key science topics consist of \"Pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)\", \"Star Forming Regions (SFRs)\", \"Galaxy and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs)\", \"Evolved Stars\", \"Radio Emission of Chemically Peculiar (CP) Stars\", and \"Geodesy\", covering a wide range of observing frequencies in L/C/X/Ku/K/Q/W-bands (1-115 GHz). As a single-dish instrument, TNRT is a perfect tool to explore time domain astronomy with its agile observing systems and flexible operation. Due to its ideal geographical location, TNRT will significantly enhance Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) arrays, such as East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN), Australia Long Baseline Array (LBA), European VLBI Network (EVN), in particular via providing a unique coverage of the sky resulting in a better complete \"uv\" coverage, improving synthesized-beam and imaging quality with reducing side-lobes. This document highlights key science topics achievable with TNRT in single-dish mode and in collaboration with VLBI arrays."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Gb6Hms-Uo9kC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7804299385666852331", "cites_id": ["7804299385666852331"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04926", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:69V4O_FwTmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
