Parkes Observatory 3 GHz radio observations of the pulsar (taken about 7 yr before the NuSTAR observations) are also reported here. NuSTAR detected pulsations at a frequency of f\u2248 14.4 Hz (P\u2248 69.44 ms) and, in addition, the observation was long enough to measure the source's frequency derivative,  Hz s\u2212 1. We find that the pulsar shows one peak per period at both hard X-ray and radio wavelengths, but that the hard X-ray pulse is broader (having a duty cycle of\u223c 0.7), than the radio pulse (having a duty cycle of\u223c 0.08). Additionally, the radio pulse is strongly linearly polarized. J1617's phase-integrated hard X-ray spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power-law model, with a photon index \u0393= 1.59\u00b10.02. The hard X-ray pulsations are well described by three Fourier \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:cRMvf6lLvU8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18012013639673623827", "cites_id": ["18012013639673623827"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac30e2/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E7U8OvmG9_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
