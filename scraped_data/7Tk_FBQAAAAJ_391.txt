The main science goals are to increase the number of known gamma-ray pulsars (both radio loud and radio quiet), to determine accurate pulse profiles, and to characterise their high energy (phase-resolved) spectra. In the radio, the observations will also allow us to find glitches, characterise timing noise, investigate dispersion and rotation measure variability, and enhance our knowledge of single pulse phenomenology. To date, we are (co-) authors on 45 papers arising from the collaboration and P574 data. The data have contributed to the PhD theses of Lucas Guillemot and Damien Parent from the Bordeaux Fermi group and Kyle Watters from Stanford. Currently four students have active projects using the radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17701438302744686289", "cites_id": ["17701438302744686289"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6105K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0S6XoFkkqPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2}}
