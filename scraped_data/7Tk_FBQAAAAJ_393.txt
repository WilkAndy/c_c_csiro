These changes must be consistent with the science that these telescopes do best. In this set of documents we identify the most likely scientific priorities for the ATNF facilities: ATCA, Mopra, Parkes, ASKAP, and the LBA for the period 2010\u20132015. In ordering these priorities, consideration has been given to the international radio astronomy context. The intention is that the highest priorities identified for each facility represent the highest impact science to which the facility can contribute uniquely well.The picture that emerges is of a set of world-class facilities sited in Australia, with a high degree of complementarity both within the set and more broadly as part of the international suite of radio astronomy instruments. The dominant science from Parkes will be pulsar searching and timing. The Compact Array and ASKAP will be directly complementary, with the ATCA concentrating on low-surface-brightness science and high frequencies whereas ASKAP will concentrate on large area surveys at frequencies around 1 GHz. Mopra will continue to provide a unique capability for wide-field mapping at wavelengths from 3-12mm and high spatial resolution observations with the LBA will be more sensitive and straightforward than ever. These facilities are further complemented by time made available for astronomy on the Tidbinbilla 70m antenna, particularly for VLBI and 12-mm spectroscopy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5638600735487768996", "cites_id": ["5638600735487768996"], "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/planning/priorities/ATNF_Science_Priorities_v2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pDkBjX5VQE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
