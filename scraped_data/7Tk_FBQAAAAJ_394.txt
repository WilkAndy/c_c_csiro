We focus our discussion on the options available for a 30 and a 45 antenna system and come to the following recommendations.If ASKAP consists of only 30 antennas, the initial configuration should be one which achieves the best possible returns for ASKAP\u2019s top science priority: Understanding galaxy formation and gas evolution in the nearby Universe through extragalactic hi surveys. There should be the option to reconfigure the antennas twice after\u223c 2-3 and\u223c 4-6 years of operations. The two subsequent configurations would enable other ASKAP science priorities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7557257611203879224", "cites_id": ["7557257611203879224"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilana-Feain/publication/268357038_ASKAP_Array_Configurations_Options_and_Recommendations/links/54dbac4f0cf28d3de65bdcd6/ASKAP-Array-Configurations-Options-and-Recommendations.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OKHs38HF4GgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
