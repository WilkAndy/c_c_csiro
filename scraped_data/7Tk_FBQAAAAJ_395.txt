However the selection effects associated with such searches are severe, in that emission from a faint compact PWN will be masked by that from its associated pulsar. This has motivated us to search for radio PWN using the technique of pulsar gating, which allows us to ``switch off'' the pulsed emission and see what is hidden underneath. This search has resulted in the detection of the faintest radio PWN yet discovered, while non-detections around other pulsars have implications for previous claims of nebular emission and for associations with nearby supernova remnants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17824156284873063062", "cites_id": ["17824156284873063062"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lrrnZLQfXPcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
