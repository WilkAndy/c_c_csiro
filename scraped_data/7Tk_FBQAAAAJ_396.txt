A young pulsar embedded in a SNR would seem to accord with expectations, but previous observations suggest that all may not be what it seems. Controversy persists over whether the pulsar and the SNR are associated, and as to what causes the remnant's unusual appearance. To answer these questions, we have undertaken a set of high-resolution radio observations of the system. We present the results of this study, which provide new evidence that PSR B1509-58 is associated with and is interacting with G320.4-01.2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3885138812943915981", "cites_id": ["3885138812943915981"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9810472", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zduagCrJ6jUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2}}
