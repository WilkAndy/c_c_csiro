Our observations imply that the pulsar is in a highly eccentric 51-day binary orbit with a companion star having mass greater than 4M sun. No regular eclipses of the pulsed signal are observed. Optical observations in the direction of the pulsar reveal a B star with probable mass near 10M sun. We conclude that the B star is the companion to the pulsar. Timing observations of PSR J0045-7319 imply that it has not been spun up by accretion from the companion. Like the PSR B1259-63 binary system, this system is a likely X-ray binary progenitor."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10396471329226961533", "cites_id": ["10396471329226961533"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993AAS...183.9301K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fTIbUJevR5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
