About 35% of the analysed pulsars exhibit drifting subpulses which are more pronounced towards the deathline, consistent with previous studies. We estimate that this common phenomenon is detectable in 60% of the overall pulsar population if high quality data were available for all. This large study reveals the evolution of drifting subpulses across the pulsar population in unprecedented detail. In particular, we find that the modulation period  follows a V-shaped evolution with respect to the characteristic age , such that the smallest  values, corresponding to the Nyquist period , are found at  yr. The V-shaped evolution can be interpreted and reproduced if young pulsars possess aliased fast intrinsic , which monotonically increase, ultimately achieving a slow unaliased . Enhancement of irregularities in intrinsic subpulse modulation by aliasing in small  pulsars would explain their observed less well defined 's and weaker spectral features. Modelling these results as rotating subbeams, their circulation must slow down as the pulsar evolves. This is the opposite to that expected if circulation is driven by ExB drift. This can be resolved if the observed  periodicity is due to a beat between an ExB system and the pulsar period. As a by-product, we identify the correct periods and spin-down rates for 12 pulsars, for which harmonically related values were reported in the literature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:CRzUtm-VnGAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7412037536939025183", "cites_id": ["7412037536939025183"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04067", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H6Mcg97Y3GYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
