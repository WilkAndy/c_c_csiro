The observations around the 2004 periastron passage of the pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov telescopes of the HESS experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in full operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a \u03b3-ray signal from the binary system was detected with a total significance above . The flux was found to vary significantly on timescales of days which makes PSR B1259-63 the first variable galactic source of VHE \u03b3-rays observed so far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron, followed by a gradual flux decrease in the months after.
