We demonstrate that the high-magnetic field pulsar J1119\u22126127 exhibits three different types of behaviour in the radio band. Trailing the \u2018normal\u2019 profile peak there is an \u2018intermittent\u2019 peak and these components are flanked by two additional components showing very erratic \u2018RRAT-like\u2019 emission. Both the intermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a large amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch relaxation occurs on two different time-scales (\u223c20 and \u223c210 d) and the post-glitch spin-down rate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is also seen in an earlier, smaller glitch and is very unusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 196, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7496015951225482531", "cites_id": ["7496015951225482531"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/411/3/1917/973165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I-10w8oyB2gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 11, "2012": 17, "2013": 12, "2014": 16, "2015": 19, "2016": 19, "2017": 17, "2018": 23, "2019": 16, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 16, "2023": 7}}
