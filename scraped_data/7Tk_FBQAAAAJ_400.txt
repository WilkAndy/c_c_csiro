As part of an optical follow-up, we obtained Gemini H\u03b1 and H\u03b1 continuum (H\u03b1C) images of the PKS B1322-110 field. A robust 19\u03c3 detection of PKS B1322-110 in the H\u03b1\u2212 H\u03b1C image prompted us to obtain the first optical spectrum of PKS B1322-110. With the Gemini spectrum we determine that PKS B1322-110 is a flat-spectrum radio quasar at a redshift of z= 3.007\u00b10.002. The apparent flux detected in the H\u03b1 filter is likely to originate from He ii emission redshifted precisely on the Galactic H\u03b1 narrowband filter. We set upper limits on the emission measure of the Galactic plasma, for various possible cloud geometries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:EaFouW7jFu4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3189565399193715831", "cites_id": ["3189565399193715831"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abaaaf/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d4TR3tScQywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
