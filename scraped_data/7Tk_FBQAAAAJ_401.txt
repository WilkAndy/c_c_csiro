Pulsars are remarkably stable rotators, and by measuring the arrival times of the radio beam the pulsar can be used as a clock in space. Applications of pulsar timing have led to the first exoplanet system, stringent tests of theories of gravity and have the potential to detect gravitational waves. Yet, the pulsars spin is not perfect, and understanding the imperfections (timing noise) is important to the aforementioned applications. Here, we present the analyses of timing noise of 133 pulsars observed with the Parkes radio telescope in Australia over the period of 4 years. The results show that as consistent with pulsar toy model equations the measured breaking index, representing the magnitude of timing noise, has an anti-correlation with the spin-down rate, spin-down energy and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10365350973187250713", "cites_id": ["10365350973187250713"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1380/1/012161/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GVoTycof2Y8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
