Subsequent detection of X-ray and GeV counterparts also supports the identification of the H.E.S.S. source as evolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We report here on recent radio observations of the PSR J1301-6305 field of view (FOV) with ATCA dedicated to search for the radio counterpart of this evolved PWN. Observations at 5.5 GHz and 7.5 GHz do not reveal any extended emission associated with the pulsar. The analysis of the archival 1.384 GHz and 2.368 GHz data also does not show any significant emission. The 1.384 GHz data reveal a hint of an extended shell-like emission in the PSR J1301-6305 FOV which might be a supernova remnant. We discuss the implications of the non-detection at radio wavelengths on the nature and evolution of the PWN as well as the possibility of the SNR candidate being the birth place of PSR J1301-6305."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=78890963870888719", "cites_id": ["78890963870888719"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01427", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DzOD5elGGAEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
