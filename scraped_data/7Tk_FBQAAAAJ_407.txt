It will uses optimised GPU codes to search for pulsars and fast radio bursts (FRBs), making discoveries in real time. Handling our data as it comes in is essential for the SKA Phase I era so this work applies directly to the high-data rates of next generation telescopes. The pulsars discovered will enable studies of the interstellar medium, allow us to more accurately constrain the MSP luminosity function (which informs estimates of the SKA yield of MSPs), tests of theories of gravity and several will contribute to the precision timing projects of the PPTA. The FRBs discovered will have much more associated information than all previous detections. Firstly the discovery lag will be~ 1 second, rather than months/years. The Parkes observations will be shadowed by the Molonglo telescope to allow, for the first time, localisation of FRBs, and a host of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13078874863686585699", "cites_id": ["13078874863686585699"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6368K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yw3Tx2R_gbUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
