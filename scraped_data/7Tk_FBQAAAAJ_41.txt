We report the discovery of three radio and \u03b3-ray millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from a high Galactic latitude subset of these sources. All of the pulsars are in binary systems, which would have made them virtually impossible to detect in blind \u03b3-ray pulsation searches. They seem to be relatively normal, nearby (\u2a7d 2 kpc) MSPs. These observations, in combination with the Fermi detection of \u03b3-rays from other known radio MSPs, imply that most, if not all, radio MSPs are efficient \u03b3-ray producers. The \u03b3-ray spectra of the pulsars are power law in nature with exponential cutoffs at a few GeV, as has been found with most other pulsars. The MSPs have all been detected as X-ray point sources. Their soft X-ray luminosities of\u223c 10 30\u201310 31 erg s\u2212 1 are typical of the rare \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2425862582655861887", "cites_id": ["2425862582655861887"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/727/1/L16/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f0QdiSplqiEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 26, "2012": 32, "2013": 29, "2014": 16, "2015": 11, "2016": 19, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 16, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
