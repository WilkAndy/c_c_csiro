The pulsar lies within the error box of the unidentified Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) source 3EG J1410-6147, has a characteristic age of 26 kyr and a spin-down energy of 1037 erg s-1. It has a very high dispersion measure of 960 \u00b1 10 cm-3 pc and the largest rotation measure of any pulsar, RM =+2400 \u00b1 30 rad m-2. The pulsar is very scatter-broadened at frequencies of 1.4 GHz and below, making pulsed emission almost impossible to detect. Assuming a distance of 15 kpc, the pulsar's spin-down energy and a \u03b3-ray efficiency factor of \u223c10 per cent is sufficient to power the \u03b3-ray source. We therefore believe that we have identified the nature of 3EG J1410-6147.
