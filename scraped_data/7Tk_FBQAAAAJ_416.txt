However, at high time resolution, they were severely limited by the analogue backend system, which limited the volume of sky they could effectively survey to just the local 2-3 kpc. Here we propose to use a new digital backend coupled with Australia's most powerful (16 Tflop) supercomputing cluster to conduct three ambitious surveys for millisecond and relativistic pulsars with the Parkes telescope. We hope to discover over 200 new millisecond and relativistic pulsars that will define the recycled pulsar period distribution, supply pulsars for the timing array and aid in our understanding of binary evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18227618140980539732", "cites_id": ["18227618140980539732"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1563B/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VHGcCiCC9fwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
