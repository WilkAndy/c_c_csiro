The 12-m will be equipped with a prototype focal plane array (FPA) which will undergo rigorous testing throughout 2008. As part of a suite of tests, we would like to use the 64-m in conjunction with the 12-m as a highly sensitive, single baseline interferometer. We request 3 times 5 working days of 64-m time at frequencies around 1.4 GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7590926779246838764", "cites_id": ["7590926779246838764"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1450J/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7AMC8a9jWGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
