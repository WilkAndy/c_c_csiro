The key concept behind the NTD is to demonstrate wide field-of-view operations on a~ 15 m parabolic dish using a large (~ 100 element) focal plane array. The NTD is fully funded through mid 2007 via the Major New Research Facility (MNRF) program initiated by the Federal Government.The xNTD is the Extended version of the NTD and is designed to be a front-line scientific instrument in its own right. It builds upon the deliverables from the NTD and other MNRF projects and benefits from international collaborations with other interested parties. The xNTD will consist of at least 20 dishes, each of about 15 m diameter and equipped with a focal plane array capable of producing a field-ofview of 40 square degrees at 1 GHz. It will be located in Mileura, Western Australia at the proposed Australian site for the SKA. Initial funding for research and development of the xNTD has come from the CSIRO. Additional funds have been provided by the Government of Western Australia and are actively being sought from the Federal Government\u2019s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) which has recognised astronomy as a priority area."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12420104512173965258", "cites_id": ["12420104512173965258"], "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/mira/newdocs/xntd_science31.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yv9a0T8TXawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
