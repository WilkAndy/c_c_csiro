The simultaneous INTEGRAL and H.E.S.S. spectra taken 16 days after periastron currently permit both a model with dominant radiative losses, high pulsar wind Lorentz factor and modest efficiency as well as one with dominant adiabatic losses, a slower wind and higher efficiency. In this paper we shown how the long\u2010term light curve may help to lift this degeneracy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12933417540851849892", "cites_id": ["12933417540851849892"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2141882", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pNpHrrq6fLMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
