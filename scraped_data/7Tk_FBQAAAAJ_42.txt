The survey was conducted in a wide-field fly's-eye configuration using the phased-array-feed technology deployed on the array to instantaneously observe an effective area of 160 deg 2, and achieve an exposure totaling 13200 deg 2 hr. We constrain the position of FRB 170107 to a region  in size (90% containment) and its fluence to be 58\u00b16 Jy ms. The spectrum of the burst shows a sharp cutoff above 1400 MHz, which could be due to either scintillation or an intrinsic feature of the burst. This confirms the existence of an ultra-bright ( Jy ms) population of FRBs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17343965176347609542", "cites_id": ["17343965176347609542"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa71ff/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xsnxhG8ksvAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 21, "2018": 47, "2019": 45, "2020": 26, "2021": 14, "2022": 25, "2023": 8}}
