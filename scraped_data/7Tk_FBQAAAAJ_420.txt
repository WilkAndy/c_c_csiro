The major technologies for the NTD will be reflector antennas with focal plane arrays, integrated receivers, wideband signal transport, and digital beamforming. The focal plane array will be a densely-packed Vivaldi-type array [2], developed jointly between CSIRO, ASTRON in the Netherlands, and the University of Massachusetts in the USA, aiming to fully sample the focal plane over the operating frequency band. The target specifications for the NTD are: operating frequency band, 800MHz to 1700MHz; instantaneous bandwidth 250MHz; system temperature 50K; FoV between 35 and 50 square degrees. Funding is being sought for an extended NTD (the xNTD) which will use technology based upon the NTD to construct a scientifically significant radiotelescope array with equivalent collecting area to a 64m dish.This paper will concentrate on the system trade-offs for both the NTD and also looking towards the xNTD. This is important because ultimately the performance trade-offs of the system are measured against the science goals of the xNTD [3]. The overall philosophy is to move the system costs away from fixed-cost components, such as the reflector antenna structure, and towards components whose cost falls with time and quantity of production, such as the integrated receiver and DSP components. The major sub-systems involved in the NTD trade off study are: the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16908871208079745567", "cites_id": ["16908871208079745567"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=27594996bf42b6df7a6a7885b04e20ee4013027c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H2Js1sZgqOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
