The nature of these minima is not clear, but the most likely explanation is that the CCOs have evacuated the neighboring gas. This survey also allowed us to detect a weak, diffuse radio nebula inside the SNR G266.2\u22121.2, probably created by the winds of its associated CCO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1576029230275267301", "cites_id": ["1576029230275267301"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/imprints-of-neutron-stars-in-the-interstellar-medium/32161B7E5A0F0D0ADB9926788E856CC1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5YowGjwu3xUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
