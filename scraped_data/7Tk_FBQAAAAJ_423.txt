Here we show that the Vela pulsar\u2019s (B803345) variability corresponds to lognormal \nfield statistics, consistent with the prediction of stochastic growth theory (SGT) for a linear \ninstability close to marginal stability. The pulsar\u2019s variability is thus a direct manifestation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11196808348543544366", "cites_id": ["11196808348543544366"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/record/seri/ASPC./0302/2003ASPC..302..191C.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LuwQqd4NY5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
