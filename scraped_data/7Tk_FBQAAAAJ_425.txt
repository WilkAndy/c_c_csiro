Each component has its own time and frequency behaviour. The average pulse profile changes its width with frequency, typically as \u03bd\u22120.26. The location (pulse phase) of the subpulses refered to a fiducial point within the profile follows the same \u03bd\u22120.26 law as the width of the average pulse profile. The fiducial point in the pulse profile follows the interstellar plasma dispersion relation exactly: the source emission at this phase is simultaneous at all frequencies. The subpulse width is typically nearly constant with frequency. Emission of a subpulse may be systematically absent at certain frequency ranges, the pulse profile may be different there. Micropulses are typically very wideband: \u223c1GHz or more. Individual micropulse widths are constant with frequency. Its time width distributions have upper limits (0.1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:nqdriD65xNoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1922684127749753416", "cites_id": ["1922684127749753416"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/microstructure-and-the-pulsar-emission-mechanism/3CECA1FC2C966A5DC7EF6791EC0509A7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SErOAQe_rhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
