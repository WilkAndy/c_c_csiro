We conclude that most shell SNRs will not have a detectable pulsar associated with them, and that many claimed associations are merely geometric projection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8589491508013224477", "cites_id": ["8589491508013224477"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/associations-between-pulsars-and-supernova-remnants/1EA44B17F18B0081DD9B3B3F3A4410D4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HdJceAQBNHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
