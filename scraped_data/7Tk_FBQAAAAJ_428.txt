In contrast, about approximately 180 supernova remnants are known and this is likely to be about 30% of the total population. The detection of pulsars is thus much more prone to selection effects than that of supernova remnants. A study of the selection effects involved in SNR searches was done by Helfand et al.(1989, Astrophys. J., 341, 151). They concluded that pulsar nebulae or'plerions' were extremely difficult to detect because of their resemblance to compact HII regions, and that they were thus grossly under-represented in the current catalogue. They further concluded that the radial distribution of SNRs had not been resolved. When attempting to consider the importance of selection effects in pulsar searches, three factors are crucial.
