The galactic plane was surveyed between 270\u2264 l\u2264 20,| b|\u2264 4, an area of 880 square degrees. The observing centre frequency was 1509 MHz, and two separate receiver systems recording data in parallel were used. The first system employed a bandwidth of 80 MHz, and sampled data every 300 microseconds. This system was especially sensitive to pulsars with periods of less than 10 milliseconds. The second system had a bandwidth of 320 MHz and a sampling rate of 1.2 milliseconds. The minimum detectable flux density of this system was 1 milli-Jansky. The survey detected a total of 100 pulsars, 46 of which were previously undiscovered. The periods of the newly discovered pulsars ranged between 47 milliseconds and 2.5 seconds. At least four pulsars with ages less than 25,000 years were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:cNe27ouKFcQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14290842529273785074", "cites_id": ["14290842529273785074"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/0b1bffb61a233793f00790e68498ea72/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366&diss=y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8qpocpBFU8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1}}
