With a timing baseline of \u223c3.5\u2009yr we are able to measure the derivative of the spin frequency () for the first five pulsars. Upper limits on the pulsar line-of-sight acceleration are estimated and compared with predictions based on analytical models of the cluster. We find that PSRs J1326\u22124728B and D show large negative accelerations, which are in tension with the minimum acceleration predicted by analytical models. We searched for pulsed \u03b3-ray signals using 14.3\u2009yr of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Although we found no evidence for \u03b3-ray pulsations, PSRs J1326\u22124728A, B, C, and E are associated with X-ray sources. This suggests that the observed \u03b3-ray emission from Omega Centauri is likely caused by the emission of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:MGPUR4WVBMEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/521/2/2616/7076880", "cites_per_year": {}}
