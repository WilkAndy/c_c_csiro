Specifically, we present measurements for 1170 pulsars, observed by the Thousand Pulsar Array programme at the 64-dish SARAO MeerKAT radio telescope, in a frequency band from 856 to 1712 MHz. We provide rotation measures (RM), dispersion measures, flux densities, and polarization properties. The catalogue includes 254 new RMs that substantially increase the total number of known pulsar RMs. Our integration times typically span over 1000 individual rotations per source. We show that the radio (pseudo-) luminosity has a strong, shallow dependence on the spin-down energy, proportional to , that contradicts some previous proposals of population synthesis studies. In addition, we find a significant correlation between the steepness of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3BvdIg-l-ZAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/520/3/4582/7049638", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w-_1j-O1ee4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
