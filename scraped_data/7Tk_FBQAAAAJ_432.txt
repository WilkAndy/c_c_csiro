Following the detection of a short burst from the source with Swift-BAT on 2022 April 7, observations by NICER detected an increased flux peaking at (6.0\u00b10.4)\u00d7 10\u2212 11 erg s\u2212 1 cm\u2212 2 in the soft X-ray band, falling to a baseline level of 1.7\u00d7 10\u2212 11 erg s\u2212 1 cm\u2212 2 over a 17 day period. Joint spectroscopic measurements by NICER and NuSTAR indicated no change in the hard nonthermal tail despite the prominent increase in soft X-rays. Observations at radio wavelengths with Murriyang, the 64 m Parkes radio telescope, revealed that the persistent radio emission from the magnetar disappeared at least 22 days prior to the initial Swift-BAT detection and was redetected two weeks later. Such behavior is unprecedented in a radio-loud magnetar, and may point to an unnoticed slow rise in the high-energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:mVC4hKzE2FoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acbc7c/meta", "cites_per_year": {}}
