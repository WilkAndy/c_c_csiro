We apply the RVM to a sample of 854 radio pulsars observed with the MeerKAT telescope in order to draw conclusions about the population of pulsars as a whole. The main results are that (i) the geometrical interpretation of the position angle traverse is valid in the majority of the population, (ii) the pulsars for which the RVM fails tend to have a high fraction of circular polarization compared to linear polarization, (iii) emission heights obtained through both geometrical and relativistic methods show that the majority of pulsars must have emission heights less than 1000~km independent of spin period, (iv) orthogonal mode jumps are seen in the position angle traverse in about one third of the population. All these results are weakly dependent on the pulsar spin-down energy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:adHtZc2wMuEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03988", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BwmLydvLmZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
