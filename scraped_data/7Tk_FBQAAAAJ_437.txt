The nature and formation of such tiny-scale atomic structures (TSAS) need to be better understood. We report a tentative detection of TSAS with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.2 toward PSR B1557\u2212 50 in the second epoch of two Parkes sessions just 0.36 yr apart, which are the closest-spaced spectral observations toward this pulsar. One absorption component showing marginal variations has been identified. Based on the pulsar's proper motion of 14 mas yr\u2212 1 and the component's kinematic distance of 3.3 kpc, the corresponding characteristic spatial scale is 17 au, which is among the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:XAp-VaTZjjwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abef6e/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E3Erw3aZ7JQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
