In this paper, we present follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (IAU label AT2017gfo) by 14 Australian telescopes and partner observatories as part of Australian-based and Australian-led research programs. We report early- to late-time multi-wavelength observations, including optical imaging and spectroscopy, mid-infrared imaging, radio imaging, and searches for fast radio bursts. Our optical spectra reveal that the transient source emission cooled from approximately 6 400 K to 2 100 K over a 7-d period and produced no significant optical emission lines. The spectral profiles, cooling rate, and photometric light curves are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15757950873192228610", "cites_id": ["15757950873192228610"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/follow-up-of-gw170817-and-its-electromagnetic-counterpart-by-australianled-observing-programmes/D61359DD9A7144A2904B5F0F402C2CB9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AueteNR8r9oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 28, "2019": 30, "2020": 43, "2021": 37, "2022": 26, "2023": 11}}
