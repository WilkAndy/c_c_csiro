No pulsations have been detected from the central X-ray source that is almost certainly the neutron star birthed in the supernova, but the expected pulsed flux density is a factor of 3 or more below existing surveys. We propose deep observations that should detect pulsations if the source is analogous to other young SNR/PWN complexes. Knowing the pulsar energetics is key to understanding the current state and evolutionary history of the system, which in turn will increase our knowledge of star formation in the LMC, where only five PWNe are known to date."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NZNkWSpQBv0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_data/656/", "cites_per_year": {}}
