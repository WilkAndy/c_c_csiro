Data up to 2017 September 21 have been searched using standard Fourier techniques, single-pulse searches, and Fast Folding Algorithm searches. We present 19 new discoveries, bringing the total to 27 discoveries in the programme, and we report the results of follow-up timing observations at Parkes for 26 of these pulsars, including the millisecond pulsar PSR J1421\u2212 4409; the faint, highlymodulated, slow pulsar PSR J1646\u2212 1910; and the nulling pulsar PSR J1337\u2212 4441. We present new timing solutions for 23 pulsars, and we report flux densities, modulation indices, and polarization properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:vxA22ZmNLkoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/files/212305699/2006.13637v1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kfpYfU35zBcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
