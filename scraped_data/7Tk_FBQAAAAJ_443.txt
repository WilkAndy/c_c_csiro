Due to comorbidities, older patients with primary breast cancer are more likely to die of non-breast cancer-related causes compared to their younger counterparts. Biomarkers that may influence treatment strategy therefore require interpretation in the specific biological and clinical context of older women. Cyclin E regulates cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase, and its deregulation is implicated in breast cancer pathogenesis. Tumour-specific isoforms of cyclin E localise to the cytoplasm. Expression of cytoplasmic cyclin E (c-cyclin E) is linked with poor clinical outcome. We now present multivariate analysis of breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) by c-cyclin E and clinical markers of disease biology from a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:qsWQJNntlusC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15_suppl.3128", "cites_per_year": {}}
