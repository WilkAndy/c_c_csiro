Binary pulsars, especially those in tight binary systems with massive, compact companions, are useful in testing different theories of gravity, the current paradigm being General Relativity (GR). Additionally, binary pulsars can also be utilised to explore other areas of fundamental physics, such as the behaviour of matter at ultra-high densities and the neutron star moment of inertia. A standout example is PSR J1757-1854, a 21.5-ms pulsar in a highly-eccentric (e= 0.61), 4.4-hr orbit around a neutron star companion. This pulsar exhibits some of the most extreme relativistic parameters ever observed in a binary pulsar, reaching a maximum line-of-sight acceleration of close to 700 m/s/s and displaying among the strongest relativistic effects due to gravitational wave damping.
