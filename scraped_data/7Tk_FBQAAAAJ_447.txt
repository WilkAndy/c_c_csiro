Our measured distance and proper motion are consistent with the system having originated in the Cen OB1 association and receiving a modest natal kick, causing it to have moved\u223c 8pc from its birthplace over the past\u223c 3\u00d7 10 5 years. The orientation of the orbit on the plane of the sky matches the direction of motion of the X-ray synchrotron-emitting knot observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory to be moving away from the system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:rCNdntzdTkkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/sites/default/files/PDF/jmoldon_02.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
