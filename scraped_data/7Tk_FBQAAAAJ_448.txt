These were obtained from observations centred at 728, 1382 and 3100MHz using the 10-50cm and the 20cm multibeam receiver at the Parkes radio telescope. In particular, we list the pulsar names (J2000), the calibrated, band-integrated flux densities at 728, 1382 and 3100MHz, the spectral classifications, the frequency ranges the spectral classifications were performed over, the spectral indices for pulsars with simple power-law spectra and the robust modulation indices at all three centre frequencies for pulsars of which we have at least six measurement epochs. The flux density uncertainties include scintillation and a systematic contribution, in addition to the statistical uncertainty. Upper limits are reported at the 3\u03c3 level and all other uncertainties at the 1\u03c3 level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018yCat..74734436J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
