The survey observed the Galactic plane in the region -120\u00b0<l<30\u00b0 and b<=15\u00b0 (see Keith et al., 2010MNRAS.409..619K, for more details). After the discovery and subsequent confirmation observations with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope, pulsars with declinations \u03b4>-35\u00b0 were regularly observed using the 76-m Lovell Telescope and those below this declination were observed as part of the HTRU timing programme at Parkes.
