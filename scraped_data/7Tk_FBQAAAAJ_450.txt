Two MSPs and one slow pulsar were discovered in single observations of each target at a central frequency of 1.4 GHz. Subsequently, one of these MSPs was found to be associated with the corresponding LAT source. At nearly the same time, in late 2009, we used an analog filterbank at Parkes to search 14 unidentified 1FGL sources (Kerr et al. 2012ApJ... 748L... 2K). The single observations of these targets resulted in the detection of six MSPs, five of them discoveries. However, confirmation of some of these MSPs was not easy: the search observations lasted for 1-2 hr each, but some of the pulsars were not detected in equivalent initial confirmation attempts, owing to the effects of interstellar scintillation.
