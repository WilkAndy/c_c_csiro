Polarization gives information on the geometry of the star, the location of the radio emission in the magnetosphere, the physics behind the radio emission mechanism and a plethora of phenomenology. Here, I will restrict myself to a brief outline of recent work in pulsar polarization using observations taken with the Parkes radio telescope over the past decade."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/pulsar-polarization-the-view-from-the-southern-hemisphere/13B4E2020CCA6619C19D4233BA541713", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z2VbXu6jyrwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
