At the same time, a better understanding of the geometry of young and older pulsars, is providing clues about the long-term evolution of the magnetic inclination angle. In this talk, we present a simple simulation of the pulsar population that takes into account current observational facts. We show how, with very few assumptions, the observed P-\u1e56 diagram can be reproduced for a synthesized population. The implications are interesting and testable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/noisy-ageing-of-slow-pulsars-new-thoughts-on-the-evolution-of-the-pulsar-population/ED16E5C8C684055A6EC23A245B1EBA73", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Cej5xg4YpJAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
