As we move towards the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era, searching for pulsars in continuum images will complement conventional pulsar searches, and make it possible to find extreme objects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NMlhSUseqAsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/searching-for-pulsars-in-future-radio-continuum-surveys/0F23E44D2D5F62213D6DD974642FA810", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dFowwlwZeYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
