Radio observations using the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 36, 16, 6, and 3 cm reveal a complex morphology for the source. The pulsar is embedded in the\" head\" of the nebula with fan-shaped diffuse emission. This is connected to a circular bubble structure of 20\" radius and followed by a collimated tail extending over 1'. Polarization measurements show a highly ordered magnetic field in the nebula. The intrinsic B-field wraps around the edge of the head and shows an azimuthal configuration near the pulsar, then switches direction quasi-periodically near the bubble and in the tail. Together with the flat radio spectrum observed, we suggest that this system is most plausibly a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), with the head \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017HEAD...1610925N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
