They were all discovered during the mid-latitude part of the HTRU survey (Keith et al. 2010MNRAS.409..619K; Bates et al. 2012MNRAS.427.1052B) apart from PSR J1846-4249 (that has been discovered in the high latitude survey and it will be presented in one of the next papers of the HTRU series). After discovery and confirmation, the pulsars were followed-up with the third Parkes Digital Filterbank, observing them for at least one year to allow the determination of a complete timing solution.
