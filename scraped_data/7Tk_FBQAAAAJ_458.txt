The telescope delivers 304MHz of instantaneous bandwidth and for these observations the sky frequency range was 711-1015MHz, corresponding to a fractional bandwidth of 35 per cent. The data are captured with a frequency resolution of 18.5 kHz, using 16 416 frequency channels across the band."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016yCat..74574160H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
