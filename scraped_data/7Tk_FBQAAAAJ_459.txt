Association with the pulsar was based on its energy-dependent morphology. With the increase of the energy threshold a very extended emission region (\u223c 0. 4\u25e6\u00d7 0. 3\u25e6 at the (0. 84\u2212 2) TeV band) of VHE \u03b3-rays\u201d shrinks\u201d towards the position of the pulsar at E> 10 TeV. Such an energy-dependent morphology is expected for ancient pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), which feature several populations of relativistic electrons generated by the pulsar. The association of HESS J1303\u2013631 with the pulsar is further supported by the detection of its X-ray counterpart with XMM-Newton [1] with a much smaller emission region around the pulsar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://snr2016.astro.noa.gr/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/S3.6_Sushch.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ynlY8_uFTLsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
