The observations have their two polarizations summed, before being written to tape for storage. Several corrupted pointings (due to severe RFI contamination or hardware issues) were reobserved, hence finally 1246 pointings were recorded, resulting in 263 terabyte (TB) of observational raw data. A total of 60 pulsars have been discovered in the 50 per cent processed data of the Galactic plane survey. (4 data files)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://openaccess.inaf.it/handle/20.500.12386/24373", "cites_per_year": {}}
