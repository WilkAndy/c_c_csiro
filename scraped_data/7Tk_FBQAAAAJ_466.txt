It powers a compact pulsar wind nebula with a jet visible in X-rays and a large scale plerion detected in X-ray and TeV ranges. Previous multiwavelength studies suggested that the pulsar has a significant proper motion of about 180 mas yr\u2212 1 implying an extremely high transverse velocity of about 2000 km s\u2212 1. In order to verify that, we performed radio-interferometric observations of PSR J1357-6429 with the the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the 2.1 GHz band. We detected the pulsar with a mean flux density of 212 \uc18c 5 \u00b5Jy and obtained the most accurate pulsar position, RA= 13: 57: 02.525 (14) and Dec=-64: 29: 29.89 (15). Using the new and archival ATCA data, we did not find any proper motion and estimated its 90 per cent upper limit \u00b5< 106 mas yr\u2212 1. The pulsar shows a highly polarised single pulse, as it was earlier observed at 1.4 GHz. Spectral analysis revealed a shallow spectral index \u03b1\u03bd= 0.5 \uc18c 0.1. Based on our new radio position of the pulsar, we disclaim its optical counterpart candidate reported before."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:xm0LlTxljI0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrey-Danilenko/publication/279310173_Observations_of_PSR_J1357-6429_at_21_GHz_with_the_ATCA/links/55a4d8f708ae81aec913184b/Observations-of-PSR-J1357-6429-at-21-GHz-with-the-ATCA.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SgcV-p6P26sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
