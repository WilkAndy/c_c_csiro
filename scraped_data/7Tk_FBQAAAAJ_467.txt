The sporadic emission from these and intermittent pulsars makes them difficult to study and nearly all information about the properties of the objects is the result of dedicated monitoring and timing programs at Parkes telescope. This project represents the largest (and most successful) effort in constraining the properties and origins of sparse-emitting pulsars. As new candidates are identified in ongoing surveys, time is needed to confirm and time new RRAT sources. Once identified, monitoring and timing serve to determine basic RRAT and intermittent pulsar properties. Thus enabling us to identify physical causes for the extreme emission, enable high-energy follow-up \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6307P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
