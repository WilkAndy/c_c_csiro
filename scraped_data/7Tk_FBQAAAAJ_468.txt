We would like to propose a grid search of the location of this source, at 3 available frequency bands, in order to determine its nature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6338T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
