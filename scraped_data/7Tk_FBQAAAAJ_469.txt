ESEs are important because they challenge our understanding of the interstellar medium, and the best available model requires a large population of dark, baryonic clouds. Well-sampled, wide-band light curves will provide an enormous amount of information of the refractive properties of ESEs as they occur. As the light curve the only guaranteed observable of ESEs, this project is a crucial piece in our observing strategy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6348B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
