Given this uncertainty, it is unsurprising that the effects of this variability on precision pulsar timing are unknown. We therefore propose to answer three questions about the broadband nature of pulsar emission: 1) Over what bandwidths are individual pulses correlated? 2) Does this bandwidth vary across the pulsar population? and 3) How does this bandwidth affect pulsar timing? To answer these questions, we propose to study 19 bright pulsars that span the neutron star population, exhibit a diverse range of pulsar phenomenology. We request 32 hours of Parkes observation time to conduct simultaneous multi-frequency single-pulse observations for 16 pulsars. We will complement these with archival observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6377S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
