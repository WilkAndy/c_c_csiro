We propose to make a simultaneous measurement of the angular broadening and the pulse scattering of the recently discovered Galactic Centre magnetar at 2 GHz. The previous inference of the scattering distance relies on extrapolation between frequencies: either one assumes the 8GHz angular broadening measurements scale to 1 GHz, or that the 1-2GHz pulse scattering measurements extrapolate to 8GHz. Our measurements will represent the first unambiguous determination of the scattering distance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PyEswDtIyv0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6212M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
