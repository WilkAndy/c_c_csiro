ESEs are important because they challenge our understanding of the interstellar medium, and the best available model requires a large population of dark gas clouds. We will find about 4 ESEs and trigger detailed radio follow-up studies. This project is the first step in a systematic program to understand the physics of ESEs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6149B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
