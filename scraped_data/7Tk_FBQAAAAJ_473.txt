SGR J1745-2900, only 2.4\" away from Sgr A*, provides a unique probe of the region near the Sgr A* supermassive black hole. The proper motion is expected to be on the order of 1mas/month, and its measurement will constrain the orbit and allow us to determine whether it is indeed gravitationally bound to Sgr A*. Recent results suggest that SGR 1745-2900's angular scattering is similar to that of Sgr A*, but the temporal broadening was much lower than expected, suggesting that the scattering screen is> 5 kpc away. It is therefor important to accurately constrain the angular broadening. Our proposed observations will allow us to measure, for the first time, the scattering size at 22 GHz, which is expected to be around 2 mas.
