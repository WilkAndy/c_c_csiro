These measurements can be used to test the no hair theorem and cosmic censorship conjecture in Einsteins theory of General Relativity. The recent discovery of a magnetar in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A* prooves pulsars are indeed present in this region and detectable at lower frequencies than previously thought. We propose to perfom deep searches for such pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6068E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
