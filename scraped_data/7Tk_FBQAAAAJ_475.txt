ESEs are important because they challenge our understanding of the interstellar medium, and the best available model requires a large population of dark, baryonic clouds. In conjunction with our daily monitoring program (C2965), VLBI images will enable us to clearly differentiate between two competing models of ESEs (current-sheet and cold-cloud) and directly measure the refracting structure of the cloud."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6151B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
