In the last few years we have discovered more than 40 MSPs though the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (P630) and Fermi searches (P675/P814). Here we propose to carry out precision timing of these sources to fully exploit these discoveries. Additionally, continue to study the most significant of the discoveries from the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey (P268). To maximise scientific impact we have combined the most important sources from various previous proposals into this project, reducing total observation time required and easing the burden on the scheduler. This project also makes use of all beams of the 21-cm receiver to search for transient radio burst of extragalactic origin at the same time as performing timing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6028B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
