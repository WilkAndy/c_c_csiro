To date, no counterpart sources have been associated with FRBs and their origins remain a puzzling mystery. Some have proposed FRBs come from Crab-like pulsar giant pulses or rare bursts from main sequence flare stars in our Galaxy. Both mechanisms would generate observable subsequent FRB-like events. In this proposal we directly test this hypothesis by conducting several follow-up observations on the eight FRBs from the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. This sample represents the majority of the dozen or so known FRB sources. With these observations we will set strict limits on any repetition of FRBs while using the 12 off-source beams of the multi-beam receiver as real-time FRB and transient detectors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6106P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
