Timing of these MSPs (all with periods between 2 and 8 ms) has enabled us to probe the environment and dynamics of the cluster in impressive detail and has allowed us to put constraints on the masses of several of the pulsars. However, previous studies of the cluster were limited by the hardware used. The AFB provided 1-bit digitisation and relatively coarse 88 us sampling. Through the use of the CASPSR backend, we will observe 47 Tuc and its 23 MSPs with unprecedented time resolution. For timing we will achieve almost two orders of magnitude better time resolution, allowing us to resolve out features in the profiles of several cluster pulsars, greatly improving their timing accuracy. For search purposes the CASPSR backend will provide a coherently dedispersed filterbank file at the cluster's \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6078B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
