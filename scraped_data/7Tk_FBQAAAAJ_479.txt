The aim is to elucidate different phenomena occurring in the pulsars' magnetospheres. We have chosen a sample of nine pulsars that exhibit various characteristics of the state-changing phenomenon (some are moding pulsars and some are intermittent pulsars). We plan to use the dual-band receiver that will simultaneously provide us with information at widely separated frequency bands."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.5987H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
