We show that the differences in the total intensity pulse morphology between the two classes are in general rather subtle. A much more significant difference is the fractional polarization which is very high for high pulsars and low for low pulsars. The at the transition is very similar to the death line predicted for curvature radiation. This suggests a possible link between high energy and radio emission in pulsars and could imply that \u03b3-ray efficiency is correlated with the degree of linear polarization in the radio band. The degree of circular polarization is in general higher in the second component of doubles, which is possibly caused by the effect of corotation on the curvature of the field lines in the inertial observer frame. The most direct link between the high-energy emission and the radio emission \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7503348951917605971", "cites_id": ["7503348951917605971"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/391/3/1210/977965", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UzTZCB5AIWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 10, "2010": 16, "2011": 13, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 22, "2016": 9, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
