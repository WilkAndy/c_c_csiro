We have already discovered 40 pulsars from just 30% of processed data. Extrapolation and population synthesis show that the Galactic plane survey will result in at least a further 120 discoveries. Currently, with data processing on-going employing all available computing resources, we expect about 20 new discoveries per semester. The discovery of pulsars is just a first step and interesting science can usually only be revealed when a follow-up timing campaign is carried out. One year of initial timing is the minimal timespan required to fully-characterise any newly-discovered pulsars, essential for deriving pulsar parameters such as the characteristic age, magnetic field strength, spin-down rate, as well as to detect any unexpected behaviour of the pulsar which might \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.5975N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
