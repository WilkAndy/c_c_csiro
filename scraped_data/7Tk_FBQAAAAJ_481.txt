During the periastron passage the system displays transient non-thermal unpulsed emission from radio to very high energy gamma rays. At radio wavelengths we can independently study the pulsations and the unpulsed transient emission, which was shown to be extended on AU scales and variable. The pulsed and unpulsed components provide valuable information on the binary system geometry, the physical properties of the pulsar, which is the main source of energy of the broadband emission, and the characteristics of the outflow of accelerated particles. We present a summary of the observational instruments and techniques at radio wavelengths used to observe PSR B1259\u201363 and we describe the observable and derived properties we can obtain. Finally, we summarize the main radio results of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2010194514601732", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WllE07XgQAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
