Observations with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope revealed an unexpected GeV \u03b3-ray flaring activity of the system, reaching the spin-down luminosity of the pulsar, around 30 days after periastron. We combine the GeV data with data in other wavebands with the goal of clarifying the origin of the flare. There are no clear signatures of variability at radio, X-ray and TeV energies at the time of the GeV flare. Our optical spectroscopic monitoring reveals clear variability around periastron in the H\u03b1 emission line, which is probably due to the gravitational interaction between the pulsar and the circumstellar disk. Although the influence of the pulsar wind cannot be discarded, it does not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22332305W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
