The aim of this proposal is to carry out tests of the new backend instruments which cannot be carried out during standard maintenance periods. High precision pulsar timing experiments require cross-coupling in the feed to be measured. This can only be done using observations of PSR J0437-4715 from rise-to-set. We propose to undertake such observations and make the results available for any users of the telescope."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5656H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
