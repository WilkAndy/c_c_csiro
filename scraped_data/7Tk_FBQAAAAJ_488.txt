The first of> 20\" dark\" TeV sources discovered by HESS, much weaker counterparts at lower wavelegnths, it is now identified as a PWN. The source shows energy dependent morphology at TeV energies and a relative weak X-ray PWN has been found around PSR J1301-6305. The PMN survey data reveals a hint of an association in the radio wavebands, with a flux upper limit of 0.03 Jy/beam. A one-zone leptonic emission model suggests an extraordinary low level of synchrotron emission, with a very low magnetic field of 1.6 uG. We propose to use ATCA to obtain sensitive, high-resolution radio data of HESS J1303-631. These observation will allow to establish radio counterparts of HESS J1303-631, determine the electron population, and provide insights about the formation processes that lead to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5303D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
