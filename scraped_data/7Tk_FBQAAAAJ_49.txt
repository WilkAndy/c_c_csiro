The detection and study of pulsars in gamma rays give insights into the populations of neutron stars and supernova rates in the Galaxy, into particle acceleration mechanisms in neutron star magnetospheres, and into the \u201cengines\u201d driving pulsar wind nebulae. LAT's unprecedented sensitivity between 20 MeV and 300 GeV together with its 2.4 sr field-of-view makes detection of many gamma-ray pulsars likely, justifying the monitoring of over two hundred pulsars with large spin-down powers. To search for gamma-ray pulsations from most of these pulsars requires a set of phase-connected timing solutions spanning a year or more to properly align the sparse photon arrival times. We describe the choice of pulsars and the instruments involved in the campaign \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15001315345012449747", "cites_id": ["15001315345012449747"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2008/48/aa10285-08/aa10285-08.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:02EVb9NgL9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 35, "2010": 27, "2011": 23, "2012": 13, "2013": 14, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
