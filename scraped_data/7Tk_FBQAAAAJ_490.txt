The aim is to develop a more specific understanding of the dynamical behavior of their magnetospheres and ultra-strong magnetic fields, which are responsible for X-ray and gamma-ray outbursts, magnetospheric currents and particle acceleration, and heating of the neutron star surface. 1E 1547.0-5408 has been remarkably active over the past 3.5 years: following a large X-ray outburst in October 2008, radio emission ceased, recommencing sporadically in December. In January 2009, a much larger X-ray outburst occurred, and since then there have been huge variations in its radio flux. The X-ray flux is gradually decaying, and meanwhile the torque on the star continues to vary enormously. At Parkes we request weekly timing to track its rotation and radio flux, while we monitor its X-ray \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5555C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
