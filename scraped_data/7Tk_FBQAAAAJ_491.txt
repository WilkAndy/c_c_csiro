We selected the observation of smallest angular distance within 0.25 to each pulsar, yielding 1159 observations near 1113 pulsars (some had multiple observations at roughly equal distance to the pulsar). We scrutinized the HTRU Fourier and single-pulse search results for each observation (as described in Keith et al., 2010MNRAS. 409.. 619K and Burke-Spolaor et al., 2011MNRAS. 416.2465 B, respectively) to determine the pulsar's detectability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013yCat..74231351B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
