Recent statistical analyses imply that the mean speeds of neutron stars are within the range of 300-500 km/s. The maximum velocity of 1080+-100 km/s is firmly established for PSR B1508+ 55 by direct proper-motion and parallax measurements. Danilenko et al.(2012) have reported a likely optical identification of a remarkable Fermi pulsar J1357-6429. The 5sigma offset of the optical position of the pulsar from the radio one measured with the ATCA about 9 yr earlier suggests a significant proper motion of the pulsar of about 170 mas/yr. This implies the transverse velocity of the pulsar to be in the range of 1600-2000 km/s at the distance of 2-2.5 kpc, making it the fastest moving pulsar known. The confirmation of such a high velocity provides fundamental constraint on the initial kick mechanisms working at supernova \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5610K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
