These rare, Balmer-dominated, non-radiative shocks provide an ideal laboratory to study the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind with the ISM. We will cover H (alpha) at high spectral resolution to measure the kinematics of the upstream ISM and the post-shock flow, while the blue channel measures the Balmer decrement and probes for a faint cooling component. These data, with appropriate shock models, allow us to extract the 3D flow geometry, the orientation and asymmetry of the pulsar wind, the state of the ISM and, possibly, the presence of non-thermal shock-accelerated particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013noao.prop....6R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
