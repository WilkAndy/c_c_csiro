Based on 12 years of observations at the Parkes radio telescope, the relativistic Shapiro delay has been detected in this system. We obtain a companion mass MC= 0.180\u00b10.018 M\u2609(1\u03c3) implying that the pulsar mass lies in the range 1.1 M\u2609\u2264 MP\u2264 1.5 M\u2609. We compare our results with previous optical determinations of the companion mass and examine prospects for using this new measurement for calibrating the mass-radius relation for HeWDs and for investigating their evolution in a pulsar binary system. Finally, we examine the set of binary systems hosting a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass HeWD for which the mass of both stars has been measured. We confirm that the correlation between the companion mass and the orbital period predicted by Tauris & Savonije reproduces the observed values but find that the predicted MP-PB correlation overestimates the neutron star mass by about 0.5 M\u2609 in the orbital period range covered by the observations. Moreover, a few systems do not obey the observed MP-PB correlation. We discuss these results in the framework of the mechanisms that inhibit the accretion of matter by a neutron star during its evolution in a low-mass X-ray binary."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/erratum-a-shapiro-delay-detection-in-the-binary-system-hosting-th", "cites_per_year": {}}
