Based on lessons learned, we here proposed a more focussed search of a smaller number of sources than in the past. We believe that further radio searches for young pulsars along the Galactic plane are not likely to be very fruitful, and we will no longer search any Fermi unidentified sources there. Conversely, at high Galactic latitudes, many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) remain to be found amid carefully selected Fermi sources. Furthermore, because of interstellar scintillation, eclipses, and large orbital acceleration, we have reached the conclusion that it is important to search the most highly ranked sources multiple times. Here we propose to search the 20 unidentified Fermi sources visible from Parkes at intermediate and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.5036C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
