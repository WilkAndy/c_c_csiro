The pulsar has a period of 4.5 ms and is in a very compact circular orbit with a companion of mass\u223c 0.03 M \u2299. Observations at low frequencies show that the eclipse duration is approximately 10% of the orbital period. However, at high radio frequencies, pulses are often detected throughout the eclipse region, revealing interesting time-variable density structure in the eclipsing plasma."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18407051125443900398", "cites_id": ["18407051125443900398"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/310148/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7rOJTnn7cv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 16, "1999": 6, "2000": 7, "2001": 13, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 8, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 9, "2014": 12, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
