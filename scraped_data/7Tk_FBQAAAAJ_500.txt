The unpulsed radio emission was thought to disappear about 100 days after the periastron passage. An ATCA DDT observation conducted on January, 2012 has shown that the source displays unpulsed radio emission with a flux density of 0.5 mJy at 5 GHz 410 days after periastron. The physical conditions close to apastron will not be reached again until the next orbital cycle, 3 years from now. Therefore, we propose to conduct one ATCA and one LBA observations to confirm the presence of unpulsed emission during apastron and study its variability, its spectral properties, and measure its size and localization with respect to the binary system. The characterization of this emission will shed light on the physical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.5159M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
