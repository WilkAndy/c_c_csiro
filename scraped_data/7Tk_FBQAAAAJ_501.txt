This is a pilot study, aiming to test our proposed strategy for a longer-term astrometric program, which would map out the orbit of the binary, thereby providing accurate constraints on the inclination angle, parallax and proper motion of the system. This would in turn constrain the masses of the components and the rotational velocity of the companion star, and, crucially, improve the modelling of the gamma-ray emission mechanism, thereby advancing our understanding of this exotic class of objects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.5168M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
