Using data from Parkes and HartRAO, spanning back to the early 1980s, and applying statistical techniques to model the pulse profile shape with time, we have uncovered unexpected long-term variability, which is very well correlated with changes in the spin-down rate. We present these findings in the context of a growing population of radio-variable pulsars with correlated timing irregularities, including the intermittent pulsars, state-changing pulsars and other individual examples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/long-timescale-radio-emission-variability-and-spindown-changes-in-psr-j07384042/0FD4B205E571794189EA4A716366B9A3", "cites_per_year": {}}
