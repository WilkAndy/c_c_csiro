The high bandwidth (~ 300 MHz at 20cm, 400MHz at 10cm) and detailed 8-bit sampling allow unprecedently high signal-to-noise (S/N) measurements of the Stokes parameters down to the scattering timescale for every single pulse. Further, the relatively long observations will yield the largest sets of high S/N single pulses (~ 240,000 at 10cm and~ 120,000 at 20cm) providing the statistics needed to study tails of the phase-resolved flux distributions. Although the dataset will be large (~ 24 TB), we anticipate its high quality will make it of broad interest and have made provisions for long-term availability of both the raw and processed data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4588K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
