This theory is not yet testable with strong physical evidence, as measurements of RRAT age, spin, and magnetic field are hampered by the enormous amount of telescope time required to obtain them by traditional timing methods. We will address this theory through a new transient imaging capability on the LBA which will measure precise RRAT positions and spin-down parameters using a factor of>> 6 less telescope time than the traditional method. We will more than quadruple the number of RRATs with known physical parameters and lay a promising foundation for future transients projects with the LBA. Our RRAT measurements will be the vehicle for a complete assessment of RRATs' place in neutron star evolution, allowing valid statistical representation of RRATs in neutron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4586B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
