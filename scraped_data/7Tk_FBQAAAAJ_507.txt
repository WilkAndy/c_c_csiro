Tantalising evidence has been seen for both pulsed and unpulsed emission fromclosed'magnetic field lines in the last few years. Our comprehensive survey of southern pulsars will examine this evidence over a large sample. We request 75 hr of observing time to observe 60 pulsars with high spin down energies and young ages lying south of-40 declination."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4289S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
