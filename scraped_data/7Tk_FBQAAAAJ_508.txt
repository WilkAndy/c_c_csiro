We have discovered a young, highly-modulated pulsar that has an estimated Galactic z-height of~ 1.1 kpc, and propose observations to search for a remnant associated with the pulsar. A SNR detection would yeild a confirmation of the pulsar's estimated distance and z-height, and would allow an exploration of the free electron density of the interstellar medium local to the object. The information gleaned from this detection would help address current contentions about the scale height of Galactic free electron density, and the accuracy of pulsar distance estimates using electron distribution models at high z-height."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4198B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
