The pulsar shares many properties with the two previously known magnetars that emit radio pulsations, including a similarly high inferred magnetic field strength. In contrast to other magnetars, PSR  shows no observed variations in X\u2010ray emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3615110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9A5AfWo3FVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
