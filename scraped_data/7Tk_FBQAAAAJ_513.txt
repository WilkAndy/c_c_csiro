The pulsars have rotational periods from \u223c2.3 ms to \u223c7.5 ms, and all are in binary systems with orbital periods ranging from \u223c0.3 to \u223c150 d. In four of these systems, the most likely companion is a white dwarf, with minimum masses of  The other pulsar,  has a very low mass companion and exhibits eclipses, and is thus a member of the \u201cblack widow\u201d class of pulsar binaries. These new discoveries occupy a short\u2010period and high\u2010dispersion measure (DM) region of parameter space, which we demonstrate is a direct consequence of the high time and frequency resolution of the HTRU survey."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3615068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8loBp5ks6KIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
