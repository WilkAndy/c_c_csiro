A subset of the detected pulsars with either unusually large or unusually small gamma-ray efficiencies (defined as the proportion of spin-down power which is observed at gamma-ray wavelengths) can provide the strongest constraints on the underlying physics. To accurately measure the (beamed) gamma-ray luminosity, however, an accurate distance to the pulsar is essential. Here we propose to obtain distance measurements to four FERMI pulsars which possess unusually high or low inferred gamma-ray luminosities, and for which a VLBI parallax with the LBA will provide sufficient information to considerably improve our understanding of the emission physics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4000D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
