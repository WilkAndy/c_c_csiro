The resultant outcomes will (a) provide unique science,(b) contribute vital information for BETA observations, including calibration and imaging and (c) help refine the VAST science case. We will use novel on-the-fly mapping and CABB's increased bandwidth to cover 30 square degrees to 0.1 mJy sensitivity. We expect to detect in excess of 100 variable sources, providing us with insight into the structure of both the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. We have the potential to detect true transients and characterise them over the electromagnetic spectrum via ToO follow-ups."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.3939S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
