Conventionally the analytic rotating vector model (RVM) is fit to the position angle sweep to constrain the magnetic inclination angle (\u03b1) and viewing angle (\u03b6). Such fits are particularly valuable for interpreting the pulsed radiation at high energy. However, these fits are strictly relevant only to point dipoles. We have used 3-D models of the magnetospheric field structure to compute radio light curves and polarization sweeps when the emission lies at an altitude that is a large fraction of the light cylinder. The results agree with the RVM at altitudes small compared to the light cylinder and the shifts follow the general trends derived analytically by Blaskiewicz et al (1991), albeit with a larger amplitude. At high fractions of the light cylinder, as might be relevant to millisecond pulsars, the perturbations to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21733602C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
