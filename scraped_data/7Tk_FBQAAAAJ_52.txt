The SKA will provide a complete census of pulsars in both the Galaxy and in Galactic globular clusters that can be used to provide a detailed map of the electron density and magnetic fields, the dynamics of the systems, and their evolutionary histories. This complete census will provide examples of nearly every possible outcome of the evolution of massive stars, including the discovery of very exotic systems such as pulsar black-hole systems and sub-millisecond pulsars, if they exist. These exotic systems will allow unique tests of the strong field limit of relativistic gravity and the equation of state at extreme densities. Masses of pulsars and their binary companions \u2013 planets, white dwarfs, other neutron stars, and black holes \u2013 will be determined to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1815278943195370179", "cites_id": ["1815278943195370179"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647304001253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wxJowZQqMRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 10, "2008": 12, "2009": 12, "2010": 13, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 16, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
