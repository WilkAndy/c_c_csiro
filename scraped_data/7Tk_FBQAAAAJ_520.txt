The pulsar orbits the companion star with a period of 3.4 years in a highly eccentric orbit. We have scheduled a coordinated radio, IR, optical, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray observing campaign for the December 2010 periastron passage. This is the first periastron since the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and thus provides for the first time the opportunity to observe the passage of the source through the Be stellar disk at GeV energies with such a sensitive instrument. We will present results from our multi-wavelength campaign."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21710506A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
