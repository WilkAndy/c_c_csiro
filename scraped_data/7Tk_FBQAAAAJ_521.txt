The vast majority of the nearly 2000 pulsars known are detected only at radio wavelengths. Current research at radio wavelengths includes surveys for pulsars, pulsar timing, pulsars as probes of Galactic structure, understanding the emission process and the study of phenomenlogy of pulsars generally. In this chapter we will concentrate on what can be learned from the integrated pulse profile i.e. the stable profile formed after integrating typically thousands of individual pulses. In particular we will show how to interpret the profiles, how to derive pulsar geometry by using the polarization information and comment on the various beam models developed over the years. We show how integrated profiles of the radio magnetars and pulsars with notches may help our understanding of the physics of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17251-9_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:13jILocR6rEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
