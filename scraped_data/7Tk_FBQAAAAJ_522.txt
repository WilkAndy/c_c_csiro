The aim is to develop a more specific understanding of the dynamical behavior of their ultra-strong magnetic fields, which are responsible for X-ray and gamma-ray outbursts, magnetospheric currents and particle acceleration, and heating of the neutron star surface. XTE J1810-197 has ceased to emit detectable radio pulsations, and we request only a small amount of time to monitor it for possible revival. 1E 1547.0-5408, which cannot be observed with northern telescopes, has been remarkably active over the past 20 months: following a large X-ray outburst in October 2008, radio emission ceased, recommencing sporadically in December. In January 2009, a much larger X-ray outburst occurred, and since then there have been huge variations in its radio flux. The X-ray flux is gradually decaying, and meanwhile the torque \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:U_HPUtbDl20C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3404C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
