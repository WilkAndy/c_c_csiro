Around the time of periastron (the next of which Dec 14, 2010) transient emission is seen at all wavelengths from the radio to the TeV. For this periastron passage we propose a multi-wavelength campaign to understand the origin of the transient emission and to study in detail the shock front between the relativistic pulsar wind and the UV emission from the Be star and disc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3529J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
