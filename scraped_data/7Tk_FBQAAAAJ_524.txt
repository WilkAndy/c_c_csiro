In the radio they appear to have a flat spectral index and have been detected as high as 144 GHz. Here we propose to observe the magnetar J1622-4950, recently discovered at Parkes, simultaneously at frequencies of 16 and 22 GHz to examine its single pulses and polarisation properties. These observations will allow us to (a) determine the spectral index of the pulsar (b) examine the frequency dependence of its polarisation properties (c) better understand the spiky nature of the single pulse emission. In addition, we will observe eight other bright southern pulsars, taking advantage of the new 13-mm receiver in order to extend the frequency range over which these pulsars have been observed to investigate their polarisation properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3618K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
