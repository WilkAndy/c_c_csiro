During the periastron passage the system displays non-thermal emission from radio to very high energy gamma rays, produced by the interaction between the stellar wind and/or the dense equatorial disc of the Be star with the pulsar wind. It is one of the three galactic binary systems detected at TeV energies, together with LSI+ 61 303, and LS 5039. These two systems show morphological and astrometrical variability in their radio emission, although it has not been possible to detect the pulsed emission. We propose to observe PSR B1259-63 with the LBA to trace for the first time the evolution of the radio nebula and the pulsar emission simultaneously. Accurate modelling of the evolution of the compact radio emission would allow us to deeply understand this peculiar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3502M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
