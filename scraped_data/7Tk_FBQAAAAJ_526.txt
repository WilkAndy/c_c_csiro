From processing only a small percentage of the HTRU data, we have increased the number of known\" rotating radio transients\"(RRATs) in the galaxy by 20%, and we expect to uncover a population of old-age RRATs with spin-down properties that are distinct from their low-latitude peers. In this proposal we plan to verify all HTRU RRATs and acquire timing solutions for the most promising candidates. These observations will aid significantly in understanding the source of RRATs' bizarre emission characteristics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3527B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
