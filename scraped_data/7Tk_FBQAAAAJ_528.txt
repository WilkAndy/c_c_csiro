We know that many of these will be associated with the most energetic and fascinating radio pulsars. By selecting the gamma-ray pulsars showing pulsar-like properties we expect to discover tens of new millisecond and young, energetic pulsars. Compared to large survey projects this presents a huge return. These pulsars are of great interest for a range of different science. In particular, millisecond pulsars are excellent targets for precision timing, allowing for tests of gravitational theories, use in gravitational wave detectors and for studying binary formation. Since these pulsars are associated with gamma-ray emission, their study is particularly important as we have a very limited understanding of the emission mechanisms in gamma-ray pulsars, which can only be understood through further observations in radio and gamma-rays."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3071K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
