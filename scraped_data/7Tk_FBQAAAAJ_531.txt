The FERMI data promises to finally help facilitate an understanding of the pulsar emission process, yet much of the interpretation is hampered by uncertain pulsar distances and hence gamma-ray luminosities. VLBI astrometry provides a means to resolve the distance uncertainty for a select number of objects, and many of the FERMI pulsars lie far enough south that the LBA is the only facility available for astrometric analysis. Here we propose to measure parallax distances to three FERMI pulsars which are located in the far southern skies and possess apparently unusual luminosity characteristics. Removing the distance uncertainty for these objects will allow much more stringent analysis of their true emission mechanism."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3029D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
