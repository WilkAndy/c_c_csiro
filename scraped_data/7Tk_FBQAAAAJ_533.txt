Using the PSR J0437-4715 data, we will further increase our sensitivity to long-term effects such as the structure of the ISM, instrumental stability, and orbital period variations (which translate into a precise kinematic distance). For the new MSPs, we will produce phase-connected timing solutions and evaluate their potential for inclusion in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (P456)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3229V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
