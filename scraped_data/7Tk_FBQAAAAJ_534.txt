The source exhibits a highly elongated morphology with the energetic pulsar J1509-5850 located at the tip, a flat radio spectrum of index \u03b1=-0.26\u00b10.04 and a high degree of linear polarization over 30%. All these confirm that the source is a radio bow-shock nebula associated with PSR J1509-5850. The polarization maps suggest a helical magnetic field structure with the symmetry axis parallel to the pulsar's inferred direction of motion. This is the first time such a field geometry is found in a bow-shock nebula, and it may be the result of an alignment between the pulsar spin axis and space velocity. As compared to other bow-shock PWN examples, G319. 9-0.7 shows very different field structure and surface brightness distribution, illustrating the large diversity of the population."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010HEAD...11.1613N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
