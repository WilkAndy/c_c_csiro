The HE/VHE emission is basically interpreted as the result of inverse Compton upscattering of stellar UV photons by relativistic electrons. The acceleration of electrons seems to be produced by shocks between the relativistic wind of a young non-accreting pulsar and the wind of the stellar companion [10, 17]. The three sources show a very similar broadband spectral energy distribution (SED)[10]. Contrary to X-ray binaries, all three sources have the peak of the SED at MeV-GeV energies. For these reasons, they can be considered gamma-ray binaries. However, the nature of the compact objects in LS 5039 and LS I+ 61 303 is unknown because their masses are not well constrained by the system mass functions [8, 9, 7], and no pulsations have been found. These systems have been extensively observed at VHE during several orbital cycles, while the observations of PSR B1259\u2212 63, the only system with a confirmed pulsar, are scarce due to the long orbital period of 3.4 yr. Any observational link between the three gamma-ray binaries would shed light in the understanding of this kind of systems. On the other hand, Cygnus X-3 was detected above 100 MeV by the AGILE and Fermi satellites [18, 1]. The MAGIC collaboration reported evidence of a short flare of 80 minutes from Cygnus X-1 at TeV energies [6], and Sabatini et al.(2010)[16] reported a flare with AGILE. However, the nature of these detections, flares not correlated with the orbital phase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pos.sissa.it/125/062/pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KFPg6EgSuxYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
