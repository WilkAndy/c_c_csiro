We now report results of a large series from a single centre with a dedicated elderly breast cancer service, with long term follow-up.Methods: During a period of> 20 years, 1,031 elderly (> 70 years) women with ER positive early operable primary breast cancer received either surgery (\u00b1adjuvant endocrine therapy)(N= 436) or primary endocrine therapy (N= 595)(> 80% using tamoxifen) as initial treatment. The initial treatment was decided based on fitness for surgery and patient choice.Results: After a median follow-up of 49 months (range 0\u2013261 months), patients between 70\u201380 years, treated by surgery, had better 5-year breast cancer specific survival as compared to their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:GYcXSSpN504C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ejso.com/article/S0748-7983(09)00385-0/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
