In women> 80 years, surgery and primary endocrine therapy did not produce any difference in breast cancer specific survival, and this appears to be related to the preponderance of strongly ER+ tumours. We now report analysis of causes of death for the same series.Methods: During a period of> 20 years, 1,031 elderly (> 70 years) women with ER+ early operable primary breast cancer received either surgery\u00b1adjuvant endocrine therapy (N= 436) or primary endocrine therapy (N= 595)(> 80% using tamoxifen) as initial treatment, with complete follow-up information till deaths. The initial treatment was decided based on fitness for surgery and patient choice. For the 449 deceased patients, analysis was carried out on causes of deaths.Results:Tabled 1Causes of death by age groupDeaths \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:rbGdIwl2e6cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ejso.com/article/S0748-7983(09)00262-5/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
