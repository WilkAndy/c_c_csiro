We used a novel quadratic fitting algorithm to obtain an accurate RM from the calibrated polarization profiles recorded across 256 MHz of receiver bandwidth. The new data are used in conjunction with previously known dispersion measures and the NE2001 electron-density model to study models of the direction and magnitude of the Galactic magnetic field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6758955476732416418", "cites_id": ["6758955476732416418"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/386/4/1881/1457999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ohFREzKizF0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 17, "2010": 17, "2011": 12, "2012": 16, "2013": 11, "2014": 4, "2015": 14, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
