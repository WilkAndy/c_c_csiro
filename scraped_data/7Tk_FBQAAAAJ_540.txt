A tentative timing solution places the source in the category of Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars (AXPs), with a surface magnetic field of~ 1.9 x 10^ 14 G, and an age of~ 8300 years. AXPs are neutron stars which rotate with periods typically in the range 5-12 s, and which have extremely high magnetic field strengths, typically> 10^ 14 G. If found to be an AXP, it would be the first to have been discovered in the radio, and would be a unique link between the normal pulsars and the X-Ray emitting magnetars. We propose to image the field containing this source, to look for point source emission from the pulsar, in order to better constrain its position on the sky, and hence obtain a better timing solution. We might also expect to see a supernova remnant in the field if the source is truly as young as our timing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2770B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
