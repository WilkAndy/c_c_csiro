We propose follow-up ATCA observations to reveal its detailed morphology and magnetic field structure. This will provide a unique opportunity to study the PWN evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2408N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
