The nature of this source is unclear, but it is most likely a pulsar enshrouded by the wind of its O star companion, making it similar to PSR B1259-63 near periastron. This will complement our weekly monitoring of the source in X-rays by RXTE during its last cycle of operations (until Sept. 2009) and our optical spectroscopy monitoring with CTIO. Combined with ongoing gamma-ray observations by AGILE, GLAST, and HESS, this provides a unique opportunity to monitor the flux of this source across the entire spectrum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2264R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
