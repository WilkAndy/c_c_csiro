In particular, it has discovered a large number of gamma-ray pulsars without any known radio counterpart (where only 1 was known prior to launch) and has detected unknown sources of gamma-ray radiation in the galactic plane with arcmin positional accuracy. Here we request time to (a) search the gamma-ray pulsars for radio pulsations using very deep integrations at 1.4 GHz and (b) search the unidentified galactic plane sources for radio pulsars. Detecting (or not) pulsars in the former case will help to distinguish between models of gamma-ray emission in pulsars. Detection of radio pulsars in the latter case will enable a search for gamma-ray pulsations to be made and/or determine other causes (such as pulsar wind nebulae) for the gamma-ray emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2015K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
