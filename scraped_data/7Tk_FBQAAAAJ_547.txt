The ram pressure confinement of the resultant pulsar wind nebula (PWN) produces a bow shock with a tail behind the pulsar. Using new radio and X-ray observations, we present a detailed study of two such systems with the longest tails: the PWNe surrounding pulsars J1747-2958 and J1509-5850."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AAS...21343605N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
