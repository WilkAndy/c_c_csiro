These include pulsar wind nebulae, high mass X\u2010ray binaries, and mixed morphology supernova remnants. Here we provide an overview of the observational properties of Galactic sources which emit across 19 orders of magnitude in energy. We also present new observations of several sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3076673", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l7yJaRlqedcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
