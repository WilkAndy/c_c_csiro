The observations at 728 and 3100 MHz were conducted simultaneously using the dual-band 10\u201350 cm receiver. These high-sensitivity, multifrequency observations provide a systematic and uniform sample of pulsar flux densities. We combine our measurements with spectral data from the literature in order to derive the spectral properties of these pulsars. Using techniques from robust regression and information theory, we classify the observed spectra in an objective, robust and unbiased way into five morphological classes: simple or broken power law, power law with either low- or high-frequency cut-off and log-parabolic spectrum. While about 79\u2009per\u2009cent of the pulsars that could be classified have simple power-law spectra, we find significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7752760537014520817", "cites_id": ["7752760537014520817"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/473/4/4436/4315944", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8ctq7aFWl2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 17, "2019": 31, "2020": 23, "2021": 28, "2022": 41, "2023": 14}}
