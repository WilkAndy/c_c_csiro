The purpose of our observations is to use the polarization measurements to better characterize the relationship of this type of object to the well known radio pulsars. We are in continuous contact with the team proposing and carrying out the RRAT monitoring and therefore are requiring no additional telescope time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1798K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
