Although all of these sources have been covered by previous pulsar surveys, the recent discovery of the young, energetic pulsar PSR J1410-6132 at 6.7 GHz has shown that pulsars of this type can be hidden from low frequency surveys. Using an observing frequency of 3.1 GHz we discovered a 91-ms pulsar, PSR J1028-5819, which observations made at the Parkes telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array have shown to be young and energetic. We believe this pulsar is likely to be powering the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1027-5817. Like other energetic pulsars, PSR J1028-5819 is highly linearly polarised, but astonishingly has a pulse duty cycle of only 0.4%, one of the smallest in the entire pulsar catalogue."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:KTwcwpFFj4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2088", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VAB3iULtKMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
