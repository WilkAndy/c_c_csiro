Based on a comparison between X-ray and radio observations, we argue that the two main radio components of G320.4-01.2 are a single supernova remnant (SNR), which H i absorption indicates is at a distance of 5.2 \u00b1 1.4 kpc. A high-resolution correspondence between radio and X-rays argues that the pulsar is interacting with the SNR via an opposed pair of collimated outflows. The outflow itself is seen as an elongated X-ray feature surrounded by a highly polarized radio sheath, while the interaction with the SNR manifests itself as a ring of radio/X-ray knots within the optical nebula RCW 89. We reject the hypothesis that the pulsar outflow powers the entire RCW 89 region.SNR G320.4-01.2 and PSR B1509 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6596977700479941343", "cites_id": ["6596977700479941343"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/305/3/724/983536", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:37pHLEQsjVsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 8, "2001": 12, "2002": 5, "2003": 9, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 8, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 13, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
