The scientific aims of this survey are (a) to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies,(b) to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy,(c) strike it lucky and discover unique objects (eg a pulsar with a black hole companion and short period binary pulsars) and (d) to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1240J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
