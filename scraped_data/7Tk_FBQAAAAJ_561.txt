The pulsar was found during a 6.7 GHz survey and is undetectable at more typical survey frequencies of 1.4 GHz and below. Buoyed by this success we propose to observe 4 unidentified EGRET source error boxes at a high frequency to try and find further pulsars. Only 7 gamma-ray pulsars are currently known; discovering further associations will eventually help determine the acceleration processes in pulsar magnetospheres."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1452J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
