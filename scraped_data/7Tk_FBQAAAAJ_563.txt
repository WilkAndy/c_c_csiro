We aim to obtain:(i) Polarization profiles at high time resolution in at least 6 observing bands, with absolute position angle calibration.(ii) The spectral behaviour of a large sample of pulsars over a wide frequency range.(iii) An unbiased survey for pulsars with peculiar single pulse behaviour such as microstructure, drifting subpulses and nulling.(iv) Scintillation parameters, RMs and DMs for the sample. The science questions we want to address are: What are the causes of deviations from the rotating vector model (RVM)? What is the origin of circular polarization? What does the behaviour of individual pulse components tell us about the structure of emission beam? Is microstructure caused by refractive effects in the pulsar magnetosphere?
