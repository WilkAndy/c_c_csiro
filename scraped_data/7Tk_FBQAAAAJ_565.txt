The radio flux density continues to fluctuate, but on average is now rather low (about 0.1-0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz). Pulse profiles and polarization properties also continue to vary. It is unclear what the star will do next and we here request continued bi-weekly Parkes monitoring. We also wish to measure its polarimetric properties every 2 months. For all of this we request a total of 26 hours during the semester."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1037C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
