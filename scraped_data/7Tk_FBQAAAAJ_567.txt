Radio and X-ray observations of such pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) can probe the electrodynamics of the winds, as well as small scale structure in the ISM. Here we propose 4.8 and 8.6 GHz observations of an extraordinarily elongated PWN produced by PSR J1509-5850, which has been detected in X-rays and archival radio observations (SUMSS). We aim to characterize the morphology and extent of the nebula, probe its energetics by mapping the spectral index variations, and determine the distribution of the magnetic field through polarization measurements. The observations will be also be compared to models and simulations of PWNe in order to improve our understanding of the wind-shock interaction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1156C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
