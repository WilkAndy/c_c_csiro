This is crucial to understand both the nature of the wing and to interpret the Very High Energy (> 1 TeV) emission from this object."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1180R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
