The main science goals are to increase the number of known gamma-ray pulsars (both radio loud and radio quiet), to determine accurate pulse profiles, to characterise their high energy spectrum and phase resolved spectroscopy of the brightest pulsars. In the radio, the observations will also allow us to find glitches, characterise timing noise, investigate dispersion and rotation measure variability and enhance our knowledge of single pulse phenomenology. We expect this program to continue for the~ 5 years of the GLAST mission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..901J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
