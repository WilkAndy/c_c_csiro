A systematic study of the all-sky survey has found no additional pulsed gamma-ray sources. The pulsar detections, coupled with the upper limits on pulsed gamma radiation from other radio pulsars, indicate that the simplest models of gamma-ray pulsars are incomplete."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6800296000852097849", "cites_id": ["6800296000852097849"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994ApJ...436..229T", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OXtM6i6BX14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 10, "1996": 24, "1997": 17, "1998": 14, "1999": 9, "2000": 17, "2001": 15, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
