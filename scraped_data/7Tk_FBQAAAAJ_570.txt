It shows transient emission near periastron, which next occurs in July 2007. We propose observations to (a) test the predictions made for the location and nature of the transient emission (b) measure the angular size of the orbit and hence a precise distance and (c) measure the proper motion of the system. The new broadband VLBI system makes such an experiment possible."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..902J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
