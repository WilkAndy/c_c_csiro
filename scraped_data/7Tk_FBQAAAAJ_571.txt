This may be evidence for a new class of\" dark\" particle accelerators, possibly involving the acceleration of hadrons. Interactions of these hadrons will produce electrons through pion-muon-electron decay which may, in turn, produce weak radio signals. We shall use the ATCA to search for the radio counterparts to six unidentified HESS sources. In the coming term we ask for time to gather final data on three of the sources. Subsequent modeling of the TeV production will depend on the outcome of the observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..837R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
