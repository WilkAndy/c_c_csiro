This survey utilises a seven beam methanol receiver, built in collaboration between Jodrell Bank Observatory and the Australian Telescope National Facility, operating at a wavelength of 5 cm. The scientific aims of this survey are to discover young pulsars in the spiral arms, hidden at lower frequencies due to scattering, to improve our knowledge of the distribution of dispersing and scattering material, particularly in the inner Galaxy, to find rare objects eg a pulsar with a black hole companion and to survey the transient radio sky at high frequencies. The central observing frequency of 6306 MHz is higher than usual for all-sky pulsar surveys, but is necessary for two reasons. The first is that pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering is quite bad at lower frequencies as the scattering time is proportional to \u03bd\u2212 4. The main problem with scattering is that it cannot be corrected for post-detection. The second reason why a high frequency survey is a good option is that, at low Galactic latitudes, the background (synchrotron) radiation has an effective temperature which dominates the system temperature of the telescope at low frequencies, making it difficult to make clear observations. This is less of a problem at high frequencies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pos.sissa.it/052/121/pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k2D5sApfEBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
