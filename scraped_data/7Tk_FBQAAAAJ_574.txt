We have developed a model, whereby radio emission at a particular frequency arises from a wide range of altitudes above the surface of the star, which can account for the large diversity found in the average profile shapes of pulsars. We demonstrate how a change in the range of emitting heights can account for the differences between pulse profiles of young, highly energetic pulsars and their older counterparts. Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the match of our model to real observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007wmdr.confE...2K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
