We intend to measure the Faraday rotation and dispersion evident in observations of background pulsar sources as they are occulted by the Sun. As we will be utilising a number of simultaneous lines of sight, that will cut different paths through the corona as the Sun rotates, we will be able to strongly constrain the global topology of both the plasma and the magnetic field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..542O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
