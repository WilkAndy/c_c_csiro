Our main objective was to study the frequency evolution of polarization by means of new high quality polarization data at high frequencies. Average polarization profiles with high time resolution to update already existing previous observations were also obtained. We have provided a detailed description of a total of 97 polarization profiles at the 3 aforementioned frequencies. This relatively large sample has given us the opportunity to study effects related to the linear and circular polarization as well as the polarization position angle. We find evidence that 1) a simple model where two orthogonal polarization modes with competing spectral indices can account for many observational properties of the linear polarization and total power, 2) the position angle dependence on frequency depends on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006IAUJD...2E..22K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
