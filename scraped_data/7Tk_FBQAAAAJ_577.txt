This may be evidence for a new class of``dark''particle accelerators, possibly involving acceleration of hadrons. Interactions of these hadrons will produce electrons, through pion-muon-electron decay, which may, in turn, produce weak radio signals. We shall search for non-thermal radio counterparts to five unidentified HESS sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:H7nrzBkawXsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..355P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
