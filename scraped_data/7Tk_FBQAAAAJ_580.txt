We find that the simultaneous INTEGRAL and H.E.S.S. data permit both a model with dominant radiative losses, high pulsar wind Lorentz factor and modest efficiency as well as one with dominant adiabatic losses, a slower wind and higher efficiency. Additional, simultaneous, X-ray and TeV data sets are needed to lift this degeneracy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509899", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4MYn-IJY3AwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
