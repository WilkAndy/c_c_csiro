The timing is complicated because the orbital period is very long, the pulsar is eclipsed for 40 days around periastron, the pulsar has significant timing noise and also has been seen to glitch. A model for the timing data based on spin-orbit coupling no longer provides a good fit to the data. We have proposed an alternative model which involves jumps in the inclination angle of the system at each periastron, however, the physical basis for this model is far from clear."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005ASPC..328..391J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XQGqVKQCg-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
