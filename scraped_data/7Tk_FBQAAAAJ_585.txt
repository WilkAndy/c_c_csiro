For RX J0007. 0+ 7302 these new observations have revealed the existence of a radio nebula, probably the radio counterpart of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula. Geminga, in turns, appears surrounded by a neutral gas shell at a radial velocity compatible with the location of the compact source, however the connection between both is still unclear."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004BAAA...47..264G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
