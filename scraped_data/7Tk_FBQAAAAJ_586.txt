A small glitch in the pulsar period apparently occurred in 1997 Aug, not long after the 1997 periastron. We found that spin-orbit coupling with secular changes in periastron longitude and projected semi-major axis cannot account for the observed period variations. A model in which step changes in pulsar orbital parameters occur at each periastron accounts best for the observed timing behavior."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004IAUS..218..429W", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lg-CKXZt0-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
