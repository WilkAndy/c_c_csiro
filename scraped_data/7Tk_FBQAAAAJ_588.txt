It is located in the south-west corner of the (much larger) Vela SNR, and has been dubbed Vela Junior as a consequence. G266. 2-1.3 is rather unusual in that it has a non-thermal X-ray shell. Its distance and age remain uncertain; Slane et al.(2001) estimate it to be 1-2 kpc distant with an age of a few thousand years. The nature of a central compact object (CCO) revealed by Chandra observations (Pavlov et al. 2001) also remains uncertain, but it isAs part of a radio survey of CCOs, we observed Vela Junior with the Australia Telescope Compact Array at a wavelength of 20 cm. We have discovered a faint, diffuse nebula which encompasses the position of the X-ray CCO. It is likely that the radio nebula is pulsar powered and it can be used to determine the parameters of the CCO. The radio nebula also coincides with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004cosp...35.1781J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
