Most of them have been identified with neutron stars (NS) and their origin is still controversial. Previous investigations of the neutral gas in the environs of three NS have revealed that all of them are placed within local HI minima. The association between the NS and their corresponding HI minima has been well established, though in all cases the physical mechanism that create the HI features is poorly understood. We present the results of a search for additional cases of NS-HI minima associations. For this purpose we combined HI 21 cm line observations carried out with the VLA and the MPIFR telescopes towards the well known isolated Geminga pulsar and RX J00070+ 7302, a NS candidate inside the SNR CTA1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004cosp...35.2966G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
