We detect individual pulses from the high-pulsar B1821-24 with energies exceeding 50 times the mean pulse energy. These giant pulses are concentrated in a narrow phase window coincident with the power-law nonthermal pulse seen in hard X-rays. This is the third example of the giant-pulse phenomenon. It supports the idea that large B-fields in the outer magnetosphere are critical to the formation of such pulses and further suggests a direct connection between giant pulses and high-energy emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15766346730098540996", "cites_id": ["15766346730098540996"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/323415/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xEEqPdFQzdoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 21, "2004": 16, "2005": 9, "2006": 13, "2007": 7, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
