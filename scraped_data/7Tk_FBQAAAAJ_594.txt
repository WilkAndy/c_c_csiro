Most of them have been identified with neutron stars. They present a diversity of observational properties and their nature is still controversial. One of these compact sources, 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the center of the supernova remnant G296. 5+ 10.0 has left an imprint in the surrounding interstellar medium, creating a small depression in the HI emission. It was suggested that the hot atmophere of the neutron star heated up the neighbouring gas and produced the observed depression. The importance of this finding is that it provides an independent estimate for the kinematical distance of the neutron star, thus helping to prove the physical association between the neutron star and the host supernova remnant.
