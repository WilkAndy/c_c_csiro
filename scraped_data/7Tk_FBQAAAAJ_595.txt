The region within the error box of GeV J1417-6100 contains a hard X-ray source embedded in what appears to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and also contains the young, highly energetic radio and X-ray pulsar PSR J1420-6048. As the gamma-ray source is variable, it seems likely that its origin is a mixture of emission from PSR J1420-6048 and the PWN. 3EG J1410-6147 appears to be associated with the SNR G312. 4-0.4, which harbours two young pulsars within its shell. The relationship between these objects is unclear, although an HI determined distance should help clarify this. PSR J1413-6141 may be the origin of the gamma-rays if it is closer than its dispersion measure derived distance suggests."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002ASPC..271..209J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_4y__n3_-38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
