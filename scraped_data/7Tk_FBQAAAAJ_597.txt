Short Chandra observations of 3EG J1410-6147, 3EG J1809-2328, and 3EG J1837-0606 are used to show small scale X-ray structure, put constraints on X-ray emission from coincident young pulsars, and allow for high precision astrometry of X-ray point sources. ATCA and VLA observations are used to characterize the radio emission from the regions containing these three sources and that of 3EG J1826-1302. We discuss the implications of these observations for various potential sources of gamma-ray emission, including pulsar magnetospheres, pulsar wind nebulae, and supernova remnants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AAS...199.1713R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
