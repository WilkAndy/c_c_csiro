Here we present radio images made with the VLA and ATCA of several fields which contain sources bright in emission above 1 GeV. All of these fields have previously been imaged in 2-10 keV X-rays with ASCA. Several bright radio nebulae are revealed, some of which are coincident with extended X-ray nebulae, X-ray point sources, and/or radio pulsars. We comment on the liklihood of each radio nebula being powered by a young pulsar or whether some other source type is suggested."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000HEAD....5.2614R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
