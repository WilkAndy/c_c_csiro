Phased array feed technology is used to form multiple simultaneous beams per antenna, providing astronomers with unprecedented survey speed. The test array described here is a six-antenna interferometer, fitted with prototype signal processing hardware capable of forming at least nine dual-polarisation beams simultaneously, allowing several square degrees to be imaged in a single pointed observation. The main purpose of the test array is to develop beamforming and wide-field calibration methods for use with the full telescope, but it will also be capable of limited early science demonstrations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1884267256561588835", "cites_id": ["1884267256561588835"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/australian-square-kilometre-array-pathfinder-system-architecture-and-specifications-of-the-boolardy-engineering-test-array/AED90E9E2AC003A7A7CD8028E420F8D5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y9pAKRZDJhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 14, "2016": 25, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 21, "2020": 21, "2021": 21, "2022": 16, "2023": 7}}
