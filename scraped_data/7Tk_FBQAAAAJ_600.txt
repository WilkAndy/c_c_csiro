Its orbital period is 3.4 yr and the eccentricity close to 0.9. Around periastron, the system is a radio and X-ray transient and shows changes in flux density, dispersion measure, rotation measure and scattering parameters on very short timescales. Timing observations show the equatorial plane of the Be star and the plane of the orbit are not aligned and the orbit precesses as a result. I briefly summarise 10 years of radio observations of PSR B1259\u201363 and the implications of these observations. Future work includes the determination of the orbital size through VLBI and observations at TeV energies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/remarkable-binary-pulsar-psr-b125963/01C05DCD8547D25CBA9C604578EFC3F3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:43nB0yKWghkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
