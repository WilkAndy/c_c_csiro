We have derived a formula for the braking index of pulsars via integration \nrather than the conventional differentiation method. We applied the method to 20 pulsars \nand find that virtually all the derived braking indices are dominated by the effects of (unseen) \nglitches, the recovery from which corrupts the value of i>. However, any real, large, positive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000ASPC..202..599J", "cites_per_year": {}}
