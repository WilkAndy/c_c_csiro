In February of that year he had been the keynote speaker at the Fermor Meeting of the Geological Society which discussed meteorite flux and impact effects. His unfinished paper is the first contribution in this collection of papers arising from the meeting and the volume is devoted to his memory. The idea that impacts of small asteroids or comets may be related to mass extinctions of terrestrial flora and fauna gained popularity with the work of Alvarez and his colleagues in 1980. They cited evidence in rock strata for a large impact 65 million years ago, coinciding with the major Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary (K\u2013T) mass extinction. That impact has now been identified with the Chicxulub crater, a feature\u223c 180 km across in the rocks below \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/on-mars-moore-patrick-cassell-london-1998-222-pp-isbn-0304350699/615906A0C5160115AA74A9A016BFCA7F", "cites_per_year": {}}
