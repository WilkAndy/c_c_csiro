Timing observations of this pulsar, made over a 7 yr period using the Parkes 64 m radio-telescope, cover two periastron passages, in 1990 August and 1994 January. The timing observations of PSR B1259-63 clearly show evidence for timing noise which is domina ted by a cubic term. Unfortunately, the large amplitude timing noise and data over only two complete orbits make it difficult to produce a unique timing solution for this pulsar. However, if the long term behavior of timing noise is completely modeled by a cubic term, both dot \u03c9 and dot x terms are required in the timing model which could be a result of a precessing orbit caused by the quadrupole moment of the tilted companion star. In this paper we summarise the timing observations for the PSR B1259-63 system; full details are given in Wex et al.(1997)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999ptgr.conf...89W", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zDPg0dw8m70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
