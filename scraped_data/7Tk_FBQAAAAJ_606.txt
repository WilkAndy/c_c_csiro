We find a large shell with extended wings, at the edge of which is a non-thermal, polarized structure with a center filled morphology (the `Rabbit'), coincident with an extended, hard X-ray source. We discuss the various sources seen within the ellipse as potential counterparts of the gamma-ray source. We conclude that the most likely scenario is that the Rabbit is a wind nebula surrounding a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:lYAcb2jw7qUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:atsmS8VQbJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
