These images reveal a non-thermal, rabbit-shaped enhancement associated with an extended hard X-ray source seen with ASCA. This is at the edge of an unusual shell structure; the shell has broad wing-like extensions, also with associated diffuse X-ray emission. We present results of spectral and polarization studies, describe the compact sources in the images, and comment on the possibility of the Rabbit being a plerion hosting a radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...192.0904R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
