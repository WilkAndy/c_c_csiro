PSR J1302\u201463 has the second largest DM of any known pulsar. It is also relatively weak, with a flux density of only 0.2 mJy at 1500 MHz. This is the 13th pulsar with a DM greater than 400 cm\u22123 pc located more than 50\u00b0 from the Galactic Centre. It provides further evidence for a significant pulsar population and enhanced electron densities within the major spiral arms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/293/3/L65/1112621", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8KOaMLYrbTUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
