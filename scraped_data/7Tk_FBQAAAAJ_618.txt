To test higher order contribu-tions one needs to consider strongly self-gravitating bodies such as neutron-stars. Small-eccentricity binary-star systems consisting of a neutron star (\\Eg\\/mca~ 0.15) and a white dwarf (EG\\/mc?~ 10-4) are excellent \u201claboratories' to test|'the SEP in a strong-field regime. As shown by Damour and Sch\u00e4fer (1991) a violation of the SEP would lead to a periodic change in the eccentricity of the orbit of the binary pulsar caused by the galactic acceleration. Thus the observa-tion of old small-eccentricity long-orbital-period neutron-star white-dwarf binary systems put (with a certain confidence level) a limit on the violation of the SEP."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14384635083368371545&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WRXLL2V9oMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
