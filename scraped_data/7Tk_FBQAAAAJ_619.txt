The experiment was continued at the VLA, taking advantage of its phased array mode to form a synthesized beam, which resolves out the bright Crab Nebula background. Observations were conducted between February 9 and May 27, 1994, at 0.33, 1.4, 4.9, and 8.4 GHz. Additional radio profiles presented here were recorded at Arecibo (0.43, 0.6, and 4.7 GHz) and Effelsberg (2.7 GHz) by Hankins k Fowler (unpublished)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:4n0clTBhZ78C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/pb674uknavcuroylzjguhfj6y4/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/20CAE52836CAF20884F501366EBE8038/S0252921100041713a.pdf/div-class-title-multifrequency-radio-properties-of-the-crab-pulsar-div.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
