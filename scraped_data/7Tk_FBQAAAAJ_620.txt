After the event of the supernova explosion, both new and old neutron stars have high relative velocity of~ 1000km s-1 to the center of mass of the ejecta. SGR activities can be induced by the episodic accretion of the supernova ejecta onto the old neutron star or the strange high rotating pulsar of the new neutron star. Future observations with fine positional resolution can clarify the position ambiguity between the gamma ray and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:V_vSwabWVtYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13652433106005373009&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UbA7g5Mvd70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
