To help determine the origin of millisecond pulsars, we compute the space velocities predicted by various models of their formation. It is difficult to produce a millisecond pulsar velocity greater than 270 km s_1 with any model, unless the formation of the neutron star is accompanied by some form of asymmetric kick. We obtain average 3-D system velocities of (urecoii)= 99.6, 137.6 and 160.7 km s_1 using Gaussian kicks of (ukick)= 0, 200 and 450 km s-1 (< r= 0, 100 and 200 km s-1, respectively). Our computations show that, in general, we expect those systems with shorter orbital periods to have larger velocities than those with longer periods \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WzTVkKNmPSkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/q676o5n6b5difdikj5nmcjakpa/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/EAC2CAF7D06B20D1075CEEDF9520F887/S0252921100041002a.pdf/div-class-title-the-origin-of-millisecond-pulsar-velocities-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qJSTHwxB_B8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
