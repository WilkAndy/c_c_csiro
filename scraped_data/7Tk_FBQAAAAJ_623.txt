We have applied this method to 128 sources listed in the second catalog of sources detected with the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)(Thompson et. al. 1995). These sources include the Large Magellanic Cloud, 5 pulsars, 41 active galactic nuclei (AGN), and 81 sources not yet identified with known objects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1511387466712078260&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tNdZr-SG-RQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
