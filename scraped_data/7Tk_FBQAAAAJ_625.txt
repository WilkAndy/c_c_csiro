It is shown that the displacement current in the wind asymptotically dominates the conduction current, creating an outer radiation zone whose inner boundary lies well inside the wind termination shock. A self-consistent nonlinear-plasma-wave model of the radiation zone predicts that the ratio of Poynting flux to kinetic-energy flux at the termination shock is small (~ 10~ 3 for the Crab), in agreement with independent observational estimates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:5bg8sr1QxYwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/2gsftyia7rax5bnqlvcnhznkfa/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/89A0B554BB61B2755F6A6B1C547F0019/S0252921100042007a.pdf/div-class-title-energy-transport-in-a-rotation-modulated-pulsar-wind-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9fFSt6ZE_rgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
