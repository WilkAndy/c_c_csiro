Radio observations of the pulsar led to a phase connected timing solution which predicted the epoch of periastron to be 1994 January 9 (MJD 49361.2); optical observations of the Be star led to a determination of its mass and of the size of its circumstellar disk (Johnston et al. 1994a): the star is of approximate spectral type B1e, with mass 10 M\u2299 and radius 6 R\u2299. If this mass is correct and the pulsar has a mass of 1.4 M\u2299, then the inclination angle of the plane of the orbit with respect to the sky is 35\u00b0. This pulsar has an unusually flat radio spectrum compared to most pulsars, which makes it easily detectable up to 8.4 GHz. The narrow pulse permits \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/periastron-observations-of-the-psr-b125963ss-2883-binary-system/7987A4A34DA49ED7833C3EB9CAD62DD8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gDc4C-87-LcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
