The present MACHO experiment (see eg Alcock et al. 1993, Nature, 365, 621) can constrain the number of neutron stars in the halo by the mass distribution of the MACHO detections. A possible form of non-baryonic dark matter is gravitational waves (GWs) and some cosmologies postulate a large contribution to the closure density of the Universe from GWs. Radio pulsars can be used to probe the density of GWs because of their very high rotational stability. Consider that the Earth and a pulsar are both freely falling in space; any passing GW will perturb the local spacetime metric and will produce fluctuations in the measured time of arrival of the pulse. The idea and the relevant mathematics was first proposed by Detweiler (1979, ApJ, 224, 1100), and the remarkable rotational stability of the millisecond pulsars, discovered in the early 1980s, now means that meaningful limits can be placed on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASA...12..128J", "cites_per_year": {}}
