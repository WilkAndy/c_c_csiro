Three of the pulsars, PSRs JO613~ 0200, J 1455\u20143330, and 11643\u20141224, are in circular orbits with low-mass (~ 0.1~ 0.3 Mo) companions. The fourth pulsar, PSR J1730\u20142304, has a period of 8.12 ms and appears to be solitary. Based on the results of the Parkes and other surveys, we estimate the number of low-mass binary pulsars with luminosities greater than 2.5 mJy kpc2 in the Galactic disk to be at least 40,000. If the lifetimes of these systems are comparable to the age of the disk then, as a group, their birthrate is consistent with that of their proposed progenitors, the low-mass X-ray binaries. The binary pulsars give some support to the relation between orbital period and companion mass discussed by Joss, Rappaport, & Lewis and the relation between orbital \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17069661281618801589&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tbMgJ3-e4-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
