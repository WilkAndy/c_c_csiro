The pulsar is in a highly concentric 51\u2010day orbit with a companion star of mass greater than 4M\u2299. Optical observations in the direction of the pulsar reveal a 16th magnitude B star companion. The PSR J0045\u22127319 system is likely an x\u2010ray binary progenitor."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.45960", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Usrcb6p_hsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
