This 47.7 ms radio pulsar is in a highly eccentric (6~ 0.85) binary system with the 10\u201415 M 9 Be star SS 2883. It is the \ufb01rst radio pulsar found to be in a binary system with a massive main-sequence companion; it is also the most highly eccentric binary system known to contain a neutron star.The level of X-ray \ufb01ux detected in the ROSAT observations has increased with orbital phase by a factor of at least 10 between 1992 February and 1993 February. The X-ray \ufb02ux is signi\ufb01cantly greater than expected from the Be star\u2019s corona and seems likely to originate either from low-level stellar wind accretion onto the neutron star or from the shock between the stellar wind and the relativistic pulsar wind. The system may be the progenitor of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1179802103788697469&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fXeVNcN_XxAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
