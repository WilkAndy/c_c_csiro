These pulsars fall into four classes; those with high-mass stellar companions, with neutron star companions, with low-mass companions, and those whose evolutionary history has been affected by a companion since lost. There are two pulsars known to have high-mass stellar companions. Both systems contain approximately 10 solar mass B-star companions and have high eccentricities (e approximately 0.85). PSR B1259-63 has a spin period of 47 ms and an orbital period in excess of three years. In constrast, PSR J0045-7319 has a spin period close to 1 s and an orbital period of only 50 days. These systems originated from a binary system containing two massive stars.
