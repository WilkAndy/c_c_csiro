Radio pulsations are clearly detected at all frequencies. We measure the pulsar's dispersion measure to be 1650 \u00b1 50\u2009cm\u22123\u2009pc, the highest of any of the known pulsars. Once Faraday rotation has been taken into account, the pulse profile is more than 80 per cent linearly polarized at all frequencies and has a small degree (5 per cent) of circular polarization. The rotation measure of \u221267000 \u00b1 500 rad m\u22122 is the largest (in magnitude) ever measured for a pulsar but still a factor of 8 smaller than Sgr A* itself. The combination of the dispersion and rotation measures implies an integrated magnetic field strength of \u221250 \u03bcG along the line of sight. The flux density appears to have increased by about a factor of 2 between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7092472423147891889", "cites_id": ["7092472423147891889"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/435/1/L29/1095848", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sez7YBeGbWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 17, "2015": 28, "2016": 13, "2017": 11, "2018": 14, "2019": 8, "2020": 15, "2021": 15, "2022": 7, "2023": 7}}
