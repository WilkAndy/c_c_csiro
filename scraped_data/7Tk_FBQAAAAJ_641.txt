Based on theoretical considerations, most interest has focused on young pulsars where a relatively high fraction of the spin down energy might be expected to be carried away in gamma rays. Millisecond pulsars have also been suggested as possible detectable gamma-ray sources. Consequently, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was designed with the ability to time tag gamma rays to an accuracy of a tenth of a millisecond in absolute time. This is needed in view of the long integration times required because of the low expected fluxes. In addition, a cooperative effort has been organized with radio astronomers who are making contemporary measurements of the ephemerides \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article/280/1/177/851086", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v7K8KltWZhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
