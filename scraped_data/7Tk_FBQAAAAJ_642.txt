Johnston and R. Manchester, Australia Telescope National Facility; A. Lyne, University of Manchester; and N. D'Amico, University of Palermo, report:\" We have improved parameters for the binary system containing the pulsar PSR 1259-63 and the Be star SS 2883 (Johnston et al. 1992, Ap. J. 387, L37), obtained from a phase-connected solution of 1200 days of radio timing data from the Parkes radio telescope. The solution yields period 47.762 053 92 ms and period derivative 2.280 x 10E-15 at epoch 1990 June 11.0 UT. Binary orbital parameters are a (sin i)= 1296.00 light seconds, P= 1236.81 days, e= 0.8698, omega= 138.655 deg, epoch of periastron 1990 Aug. 21.36 UT. The mass function leads to a minimum companion mass of 3.2 solar masses. Based on optical observations, we favor solutions with a companion mass of about 10 solar masses, implying that the inclination angle of the orbit to the plane of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993IAUC.5794....2J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
