Kaiyou Chen (T-6, Los Alamos National Lab) ~\u2014 \nObserved properties of many short period millisecond pulsars (P < 10 ms) near the galactic \ndisk support the standard spin-up scenario for their origins. Radio pulse properties ofthese ms \npu\u2019sars (PSR 1937\u00f721, PSR 1957+20, PSR 1855+09 and PSR 1953+29) are consistent with \nthose expected from substantially spun-up neutron stars. The presence oflow mass \ncompanions in extremely circular orbits in three out four cases indicates rather long mass \ntransfer histories. However, the radio pi\u00f1se profile of PSR 1257\u00f712 is more similar to the pulse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/record/seri/BAAS./0025/1993AAS...182.6407C.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
