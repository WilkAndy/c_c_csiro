For three pulsars, the frequency second derivatives are large enough to have been measured as well. We report here a significant measurement, based on nearly 11 years of radio timing observations, of the third frequency derivative of PSR B1509--58. We find no evidence for glitches in the duration of the data span. Measurement of the third frequency derivative provides a new test of theories of pulsar electrodynamics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992AAS...181.9911K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
