Ap. 12, 477). The pulsar, which has a period of 11.563 ms and dispersion measure of 240 cm-3 pc, was detected in observations made at the Parkes radiotelescope in the 20-cm band in 1989 November and 1990 January. Variations in the apparent pulsar period show that the pulsar is a member of a binary system. The orbit is of low eccentricity and has a period of 1.8 hr. Only the ascending portion of the pulse period curve is seen, suggesting that the pulsar is in eclipse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990IAUC.4974....2L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
