The pulsar has a heliocentric period of 5.7567 ms and a dispersion measure of 25+/-2 pc/cmE3. It was detected in observations made with the Parkes radiotelescope at a frequency of 640 MHz in 1989 July, and confirmed in analyses of earlier observations made in the 1.4-GHz band with the same telescope in 1988 May and Sept. The pulsar is either single or in a very wide binary orbit. At 640 MHz the mean flux density is very variable: in the detection observation it was about 5 mJy, whereas in several other observations it was undetected at< 1 mJy. At 1.4 GHz \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:yeL6HyUMUGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989IAUC.4892....1M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
