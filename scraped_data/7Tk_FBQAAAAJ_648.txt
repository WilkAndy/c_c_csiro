Since the discovery of the millisecond pulsar PSR 1821-24 in M28 one new pulsar was discovered, PSR 1620-26, in a binary system in the core of the globular cluster M4. Upper limits to pulsed emission are given for the 84 globular clusters and 3 X-ray transient sources observed. The paucity of new discoveries in globular clusters by this survey is considered. The inability to detect X-ray sources may be the result of processes related to their accretion disks. An improvement in sensitivity afforded by a planned software enhancement may reveal some pulsars in the objects observed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989ESASP.296..293B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I5uhWWdpH3oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
