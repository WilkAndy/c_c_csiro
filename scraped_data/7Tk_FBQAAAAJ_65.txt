The radio flux density, while variable, is approximately 100\u00d7 larger than during its dormant state. The X-ray flux one month after reactivation was at least 800\u00d7 larger than during quiescence, and has been decaying exponentially on a 111\u00b119 day timescale. This high-flux state, together with a radio-derived rotational ephemeris, enabled for the first time the detection of X-ray pulsations for this magnetar. At 5%, the 0.3\u20136 keV pulsed fraction is comparable to the smallest observed for magnetars. The overall pulsar geometry inferred from polarized radio emission appears to be broadly consistent with that determined 6\u20138 years earlier.
