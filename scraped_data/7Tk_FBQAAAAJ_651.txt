Radio observations of the pulsar led to a phase connected timing solution which predicted the epoch of periastron to be 1994 January 9 (MJD 49361.2); optical observations of the"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:hKjooKYXoHIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4321968169781863541&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:daRk0ia3-jsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
