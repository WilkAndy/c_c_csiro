Using modern Bayesian techniques, we investigated the timing noise properties of 300 bright southern-sky radio pulsars that have been observed over 1.0-4.8 years by the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). We reanalysed the spin and spin-down changes associated with nine previously reported pulsar glitches, report the discovery of three new glitches and four unusual glitch-like events in the rotational evolution of PSR J1825-0935. We develop a refined Bayesian framework for determining how red noise strength scales with pulsar spin frequency (\u03bd) and spin-down frequency (\u03bd), which we apply to a sample of 280 non-recycled pulsars. With this new method and a simple power-law scaling relation, we show that red noise strength scales across the non-recycled pulsar population as \u03bd a| \u03bd| b, where a=-0.84"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:LWqeokA2EBkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/212305584/2002.12481v1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uo5UMRv_OTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
