We find that the magnetic field maintains its dipolar structure throughout the active part of the magnetosphere, a region located close to the stellar surface and confined to a small slab of a few stellar radii. The change in width and shape of pulse profiles saturates at mm-wavelengths while the depolarization accelerates, leading to almost completely depolarized emission. Two pulsars seem to exhibit a turn-up in their flux density spectrum at mm-wavelengths."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:a2necdfpwlEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/cpmsh7o3pfb27o35uuzayrjnse/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/D71708A9394286C0C93484A7E14785FB/S0252921100041701a.pdf/div-class-title-multi-frequency-pulsar-studies-at-high-radio-frequencies-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DwTUmfRrexEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
