If the angular size of the diffraction pattern at the Earth is less than the angular size of pulsar: 0C< $ ic then emission regions separated by alight-cylinder radius will produce scintillations that are independent. The interstellar scintillation method presents a unique oppotunity for measuring the angular size of sources with a resolution up to 10~ 8 arcsec at meter wavelengths. There were different attempts to resolve pulsar magnetospheres by the scintillation method (Cordes, Weisberg and Boriakoff, 1983, Wolszcan and Cordes, 1987; Smirnova and Shishov, 1989; Smirnova, 1992). Here we present new observations of 4 pulsars: PSR 0834+ 06, 1133+ 16, 1237+ 25 and 1919+ 21 at a frequency 102 MHz from which we can see evident decorrelation of the pulsar spectrum with increasing space separation between sources in the pulsar magnetosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ojlX30-wUrgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/5etfhwwqn5fn3mmnaoixrgvzgu/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9F35981C31B600B5771384798DBD36EA/S0252921100042147a.pdf/div-class-title-resolving-pulsar-magnetospheres-using-interstellar-scintillation-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ay_lNkIOVvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
