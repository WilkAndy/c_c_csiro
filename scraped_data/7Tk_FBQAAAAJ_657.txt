ICS of high energy particles with thermal photons is the dominant and a very efficient mechanism of the particle energy loss above the neutron star surface, and is an important process in causing gap breakdown. The pulsar distribution in the P\u2014P diagram and the observed mode changing phenomenon of some pulsars can be expained by the sparking conditions due to ICS. ICS of the secondary particles with the low frequency wave from the inner gap sparking can be responsible for radio emission. In this ICS model, many observational features of pulsar radio emission can be explained, such as: one core and two conal emission components, their different emission altitudes and relative time delay effects; spectral behavior of pulse profiles; the behavior of the linear polarization and position angle."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:cSdaV2aYdYsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/cpfpn5zf65eexiqihucat3oyii/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/94BF1D8838E2074F331FB9C941BE7363/S0252921100041336a.pdf/div-class-title-inverse-compton-scattering-in-pulsar-physics-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AuuT2XBE0WUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
