An AOS is simple and effective at dividing a wide band signal into many channels simultaneously [2]. Using this system, we started preliminary observations of PSR1937+ 21 for the purpose of precise measurements of millisecond pulsar's pulse timing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:K4-iKlO5MD4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/m7b4ej3tyva75fw367u5cuypru/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/ADDD9F03F43C673D4B396A3F22DF9C64/S0252921100040951a.pdf/div-class-title-millisecond-pulsar-observation-system-using-aos-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v26Uf-AxXVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
