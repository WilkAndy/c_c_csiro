The flux density of the pulsar is roughly the same between 1.4 and 45 GHz, but shows time variability. The radiation is nearly 100% linearly polarized between frequencies of 45 and 3.2 GHz, but from 2.3 to 1.4 GHz it becomes increasingly more depolarized. The rotation measure of\u20131860 rad m\u2212 2 is the largest for any known pulsar, and implies an average magnetic field strength along the line of sight of 2.7 \u03bcG. The pulse profiles are circularly polarized at all frequencies observed, more so at lower frequencies, at the\u2248 15% level. The observed swing of the position angle of linear polarization as a function of pulse phase suggests that in this neutron star the rotation and magnetic axes are nearly aligned, and that its radio emission is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 137, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3440895529992262170", "cites_id": ["3440895529992262170"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/587054/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GhJr_kCEwC8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 12, "2011": 17, "2012": 14, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
