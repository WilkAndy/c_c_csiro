Weak scintillation is typically found at cm-and dcm-wavelengths, but depends on distance so that the critical frequency [vc) increases with distance. Pulsar intensities weaken, however, at high frequencies, since as a rule pulsar spectra have spectral indices steeper than\u20141.5. This explains why there are practically no measurements of pulsars in the weak scintillation regime. We report in this paper on first measurements of the correlation function of pulsar intensity fluctuations, of the decorrelation time ra and of the scintillation index m<] at high frequencies, ie at 4.75 and 10.55 GHz in the weak scintillation regime. The detail data analysis, theoretical relations and comparison with theory will presented by Malofeev et al.(1996). Weak scintillation is expected at high frequencies for pulsars with low dispersion measures. We selected for our observations therefore pulsars, which show strong emission at 4.75 and 10.55 GHz with dispersion measures in the range from 2 to 100 cm-3 pc, The observations were performed using the 100-m radio telescope of the MPIfR. The signals represented finally total intensity. We integrated individual pulses in the data logger over 16 seconds to obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio. To check the amount of noise we calculated the flux\" off-pulse\".These two sequences of flux values were then analyzed in a second step of data reduction:(1) To increase the signal-to-noise ratio all data points were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:wGzT3bKASkAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/76698171/div-class-title-investigation-of-pulsar-diffractive-scintillation-at-4-75-and-10-55-ghz-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CIYOmnj4hxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
