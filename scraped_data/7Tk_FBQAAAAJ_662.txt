We argue that most proposed associations require additional investigation before they can be considered secure. Existing evidence from secure associations implies pulsars are born with large magnetic fields and short periods, but do not necessarily have particularly large radio luminosities. We argue that the evidence for large space velocities from associations is ambiguous."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3MwzVuqRcA0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0252921100041932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9IhaTYbOqOQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
