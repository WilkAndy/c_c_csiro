The new detections are beginning to provide clues to the origin of the high-energy radiation in the form of emerging patterns and correlations among observed quantities such as gamma-ray efficiency and spectral index vs. age. But there are still many questions about the location of the emission and its relation to the radio, optical and X-ray pulses. This paper will review models for gamma-ray emission from pulsars and will examine how well the detailed predictions of these models account for the existing observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:3vbIHxFL9FgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/t5lwqnol7jc25hx274kyu4ixqy/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/1109B749CA881F0E82ABC5F5F24A45B9/S0252921100041804a.pdf/div-class-title-gamma-ray-pulsar-emission-models-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1EJC9v-RqooJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
