We summarize measurements of braking indices and their implications for the spin and magnetic field evolution of young pulsars. An analysis of the period-period derivative diagram suggests one or more of the following:(a) a substantial population of young pulsars remains undiscovered;(b) a large fraction of all slow pulsars may be recycled;(c) magnetic fields in isolated pulsars decay by a factor of a few in the first few million years. We also note that the observed PP distribution of millisecond pulsars may be shaped by luminosity evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:qPeb-qHga9sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/icq2kqagwjbbndtyvayy277wae/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/42D945C45D1CD973495D31762890B5FA/S0252921100040975a.pdf/div-class-title-pulsar-period-and-magnetic-field-evolution-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hgtTIL-ut2wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
