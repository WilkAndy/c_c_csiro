One year after discovery with the Parkes telescope at 3 GHz, radio emission ceased from this bright pulsar. After 580 days, emission resumed as before. The  during both on states is 250% of the average in the off state. PSR J1841\u20130500 is a second example of an extremely intermittent pulsar, although with a much longer off period and larger ratio of spin-down rates than PSR B1931+ 24. The new pulsar is hugely scattered by the interstellar medium, with a fitted timescale referenced to 1 GHz of \u03c4 1= 2 s. Based on polarimetric observations at 5 GHz with the Green Bank Telescope, the intrinsic pulse profile has not obviously changed between the two on states observed so far, although relatively small variations cannot be excluded.
