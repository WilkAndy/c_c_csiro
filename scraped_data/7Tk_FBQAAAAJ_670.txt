We find that:(1). RMs of 91 pulsars at high galactic latitude (| 6|> 8.6) show two toroidal magnetic rings antisymmetric with respect to galactic plane. These data shouldn't be used for modelling the large scale field in Galactic disk;(2). pulsars at low galactic latitude are concentrated on the spiral arms;(3). the directions of fields have a similar pitch angle to that of spiral arms.The best way to reveal magnetic field of our Galaxy is to study the Faraday rotation of pulsars (Manchester 1974). Earlier efforts have concentrated on model-fits of Rotation Measures (RMs) of some 200 pulsars, by assuming the electron distribution and estimating pulsar distances (eg. Han & Qiao 1994). As shown by Han & Qiao (1994), more RMs of sourthen pulsars are very necessary to overcome the selection effect of the sample. Recently, new measurements of RMs of 62 pulsars have been published (Rand & Lyne 1994, Qiao et al. 1995), and 45 of them in the sourthen sky."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Tfl4UtY-dJUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/jpse3qzqdvbzpjnx7o6ee555ve/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/53EE49EB789240BF91D2C7168A42870F/S0252921100042196a.pdf/div-class-title-on-galactic-magnetic-field-derived-from-rms-of-pulsars-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_p9excMjqAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
