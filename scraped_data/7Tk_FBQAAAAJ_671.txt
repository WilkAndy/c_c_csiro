The vast majority of these binary pulsars have (presumed) helium white dwarf companions with masses TO2< 0.45 Me, spin periods P< 10 ms, and all are in extremely circular orbits (Fig. 1). In a search for millisecond pulsars with the Arecibo radio telescope, we have recently discovered PSR J1022+ 1001, a 16.45 ms pulsar in a 7.8 d orbit with a companion that is at least 0.73 M@, and is more likely as massive as 0.8-1.0 M\u00a9; and PSR J0621+ 1002, a 28.85 ms pulsar in an 8.3 d orbit with a companion at least 0.45 M\u00a9, and more likely with m, 2 \u00ab0.54 M\u00a9. One other system, PSR J2145-0750, has P= 16.05 ms, orbital period Pb-6.8 d, and m2 w 0.50 M\u00a9(see Table 1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Nw_I7GeUguwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/ldo5dai5tzeghkrte4oqg7tpoi/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C39F0963D97288614F1E4C4A92B0642D/S0252921100042330a.pdf/div-class-title-intermediate-mass-binary-pulsars-a-new-class-of-objects-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fZsJHTmUiP8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
