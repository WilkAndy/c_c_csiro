This 4.5 ms pulsar is in a 2.4 hour binary orbit with a 0.027 M\u00a9 companion. The companion and the pulsar are separated by only 1 RQ. The pulsar is often, but not always, eclipsed for approximately 10% of the orbit at frequencies below 660 MHz. This indicates that the eclipse material extends well beyond the Roche lobe. During a number of observations pulses have been detected throughout the eclipse region at 1.4 GHz and 2.0 GHz. The delays measured with respect to the timing model associated with these observations indicate significant structure and variability in the electron column density in the eclipse region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:nWoA1JPTheMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/lkm4xdy42zfidcmbuvevpn7hgu/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4ABFEC37DA571276546FB4EFA17FF6D6/S0252921100042251a.pdf/div-class-title-observations-of-a-new-eclipsing-binary-millisecond-pulsar-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ouaAkrxpXdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
