These random diffractive interstellar scintillations are caused by inhomogeneities in the interstellar plasma on scales of 105m to 106m; on occasion there are also refractive modulations caused by very much larger scales. We report here an episode of periodic modulations of the dynamic spectrum of PSR B0834+ 06 seen in the sequence of observations centered at 408 MHz reported by Gupta et al.(1994-GRL). There were 12 observations of about 2 hours covering 5 MHz spaced over 14 months. An episode of very fine periodic fringes was detected, though the period 45 kHz in frequency was barely resolved by the 19.5 kHz channel bandwiths; the period in time was about 5 minutes and was fully resolved. The normal A/a was about 4 MHz (GRL)-~ 90 times the fringe period. The observations are displayed in Figure 2 of Rickett et al 1996 as the 2-d Power spectrum of the original dynamic spectrum. There is a central peak due to diffractive scintillation; it has narrow halfpower widths which are approximately the reciprocals of A/a and At<\u00b1. The power from the fringes is concentrated into the island of power centered at 22 cycles/MHz and 0.2 cycles/min. The contours at logarithmic intervals show that the fringe feature is about 20 dB down from the diffractive peak. This corresponds to a fringe amplitude of about 10% of the mean flux. The fringe feature was clearly visible on 4 occasions between 9th Sep 1984 and 9th Oct 1984, and invisible during the following year."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8uzoZH4hB9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/r2md3h3c4fe7titpe644wgqhpu/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/32035D93E04B2B73CFFA20E48729C1CF/S0252921100042123a.pdf/div-class-title-interstellar-fringes-from-psr-b0834-06-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LpJXAQrbOxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
