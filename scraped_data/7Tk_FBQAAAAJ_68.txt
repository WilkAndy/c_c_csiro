Scintillation parameters were obtained for 49 pulsars, including 13 millisecond pulsars. Scintillation speeds were derived for all 49, which doubles the number of pulsars with speeds measured in this way. There is excellent agreement between the scintillation speed and proper motion for the millisecond pulsars in our sample using the simple assumption of a mid-placed scattering screen. This indicates that the scaleheight of scattering electrons is similar to that of the dispersing electrons. In addition, we present observations of the Vela pulsar at 14 and 23 GHz, and show that the scintillation bandwidth scales as \u03bd3.93 over a factor of 100 in observing frequency. We show that for PSR J0742\u22122822, and perhaps PSR J0837\u22124135, the Gum nebula is responsible for the high level of turbulence along their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7317809465952464488", "cites_id": ["7317809465952464488"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/297/1/108/1019101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aG4WGPAUjmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 12, "2001": 9, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 14, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
