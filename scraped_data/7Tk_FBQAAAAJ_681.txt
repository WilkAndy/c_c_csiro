Variations in the column density of electrons-interstellar weather-are studied. The column is not unique in the presence of frequency-dependent multipath scattering, and this may explain the non-square law dependence of systematic timing residuals on B1937+ 21. The electron column density variations of the Crab pulsar are summarized in a structure function that ranges from 1012 cm to 1015 cm. These density fluctuations are located in the thermal shell surrounding the synchrotron nebula."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:yJjnfzR0HrkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/d4cvbqdrmnc7xdtojbmq6jyaa4/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3F573B98196307A2FBDA13EACD958BD8/S0252921100041099a.pdf/div-class-title-precision-pulsar-timing-in-the-presence-of-interstellar-weather-psr-b1937-21-and-the-crab-pulsar-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5YWTnpEOXAAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
