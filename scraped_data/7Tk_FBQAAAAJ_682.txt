Blue shows intervals where the pulsar was detectable, while red shows where it was not. The left plot shows the absolute number of observations for each orbital phase, while the right plot is normalised to show the fractional detectability at each orbital phase."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:AFmTUeZ1pmEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/asa2021/files/2021/07/AndrewCameron.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N-tSdWjGtNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
