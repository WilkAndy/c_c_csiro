Hubble data also suggest a phase modulation peak at the same period with the amplitude (0.07 \u0105 0.02). New stroboscopic data from December 1995 Asiago observations suggests the modulation amplitude (0.0045 \u01050. 0015) magnitude, consistent with previous results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:qCpRzq7zkD8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/5oa3chx2nfakpmtloc27jpinru/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3AFB50CDE6A0A565C79A338AB9C997CE/S0252921100041750a.pdf/div-class-title-a-60-second-periodic-modulation-in-crab-pulsar-optical-light-curve-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zYMhkW7Df1IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
