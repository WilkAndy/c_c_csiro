We discuss current issues about the electric-field acceleration along magnetic field lines and subsequent pair creation, and also about the pulsar wind problem. It is stressed that any local model, such as the inner gap model, the outer gap model and the pulsar wind model, must have free parameters to link it to other part of the magnetosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:tBlTYpvFGQIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/3a6ngxy5xjd67idziatpno75x4/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/FE03C3E3BA6CA5515AA7179B39D0B142/S0252921100041981a.pdf/div-class-title-pulsar-electrodynamics-pulsars-and-puzzlers-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AHH2bj3wBR4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
