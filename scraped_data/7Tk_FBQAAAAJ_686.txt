From the observations, the angle 9 between the B star spin axis and the orbital angular momentum is constrained to be 25< 6< 41 (Kaspi et al. 1996b). Under the conventional assumption that the pre-supernova angular momenta were aligned, this provides direct evidence for an asymmetric supernova explosion. In addition, a large, unexpected orbital decay is observed in the system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:gV6rEsy15s0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/fktrxxrwqjgcxhxl2qugn5v374/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/367B52074ABA6B977C99C3D5ADCB3751/S0252921100042299a.pdf/div-class-title-classical-spin-orbit-coupling-and-periastron-advance-in-psr-j0045-7319-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r6nheBQiLp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
