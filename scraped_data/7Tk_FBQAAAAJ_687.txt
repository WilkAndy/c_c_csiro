Pulsars with long periods (P> 1 s) belong apparently to a single population described by a single model and by one emission mechanism. They differ one from another by their geometry and by initial values of P and P. These parameters determine scales and a structure of magnetospheres, electric and magnetic fields, transformation coefficients etc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:l6Q3WhenKVUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/oe27crk7ubhfhkfhqdwqv2tzi4/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C3E37DE0ABDB93B1D5C45B807B961EC5/S0252921100041038a.pdf/div-class-title-the-cluster-analysis-of-pulsar-parameters-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hsbo1VFAe-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
