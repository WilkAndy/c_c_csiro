Histogram of I-distribution is characterized by the mean value< logi>= 28.45 and by the mean-square-root deviation S= 1.0. We have analysed also data for shortperiodic pulsars (P< 0.1 s) and long-periodic ones (P> 1 s) separately. The main goal of such separation was to test the hypothesis on two types of pulsars (Malov, 1987): i) for the first group of objects radiation is emitted from the neighbourhood of the light cylinder (r= r^ c= cP/2ir, P is the pulsar period), ii) for the second one emission is generated at distances r< C r^ c-In the second case the main mechanism of radiation is curvature radiation. For the first group of pulsars the radiation is connected with the cyclotron mechanism. The difference between two basic mechanisms and the locations of the emission generation regions must cause some differences in the observable features for these two classes of pulsars.Our analysis has shown that N (log L) for pulsars with long periods is nearly the same as for the whole sample. However the distribution for objects with P< 0.1 s is uniform in the range logi= 27\u201432 and characterised by values< logi>= 29.8 and S\u20141.4. There is the evident difference in the values of transformation coefficients"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/quid2qtopbbhpg43siedg6pvne/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DFC994C7B2BA5B98C3E3087F0BBE3190/S025292110004104Xa.pdf/div-class-title-the-investigations-of-pulsar-integral-radio-luminosities-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JnWymTXEHL8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
