After 7 billion years of orbital decay due to gravitational radiation, the millisecond pulsar PSR J0751+ 1807 will enter a low-mass X-ray binary phase. When the orbital period reaches about 5 minutes, the white dwarf will overflow its Roche lobe, transferring mass to the neutron star. Its predicted observational X-ray parameters are very similar to the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary 1820\u2014303. The ultimate fate of the system after Roche-lobe overflow is unknown. One possibility is that the companion may eventually tidally disrupt, leaving a disk of material which could form into planets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:oqD4_j7ulsYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/yk7sk7hxrnardkb4nddcvcncqm/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3C48BD8E81FEDCAD5C9BC74EB70C8612/S0252921100042263a.pdf/div-class-title-a-millisecond-pulsar-progenitor-to-an-ultra-compact-low-mass-x-ray-binary-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JqW6wh7-SjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
