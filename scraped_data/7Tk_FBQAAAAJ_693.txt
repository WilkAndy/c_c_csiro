The current timing model includes significant contributions from the second and the third-order period derivatives. If these contributions are related to dynamical effects induced by a fourth distant planet, it would be a Saturn-mass object in a~ 170 year orbit around the pulsar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:lK9BDNCuzFgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/gyh5wysdbjbgdhlqzg52i5w7bm/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/80C5010C4C6C53BA35C1295FECDC5251/S0252921100041105a.pdf/div-class-title-further-observations-of-the-planets-pulsar-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rPVTwIE1h6AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
