Several methods have been proposed; for example, the microlensing effect (Paczyriski 1986), and the parallactic variation of gravitational deflection of the light from the source (Hosokawa et al. 1993). Recently some candidates for MACHOs-a kind of dark matter candidates in the Galactic halo-have been discovered by their microlensing effect, and their masses were estimated to be of the order of 0.1 M\u00a9, under many assumptions. Actual measurement of MACHO masses are important in specifying what kind of object the MACHO is.We proposed a new method: the variation of the gravitational time delay of pulses from a pulsar caused by the motion of foreground stars relative to the pulsar in the pulsar timing observation (Ohnishi et al. 1995). Consider that the observer, the foreground star and the pulsar are well aligned. In this situation, the gravitational time delay due to the proper motion of the star relative to the pulsar is expressed as"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:oursBaop5wYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/71659791/S0252921100041233.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4bFw3V8InxAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
