Such observations provide our most direct clues to the structure of the magnetic fields around pulsars, and are especially important in the case of millisecond pulsars, where radio emission necessarily originates very close to the neutron star surface."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:0ngZmJvimKcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/dzemude3bjd3zgxj6minj4nzya/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/99E3B52E064B31272D38CE7CB389C017/S0252921100041622a.pdf/div-class-title-polarimetric-observations-of-psr-j0437-4715-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KXsZaUEO0EQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
