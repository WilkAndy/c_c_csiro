Observations of its supernova remnant (MSH 15-52) offer a rare chance to study such a young pulsar and to explore its surroundings, which in X-rays include the pulsar's 10x6 arcmin X-ray synchrotron nebula and the peculiar, filamentary optical nebula, RCW 89, that sits on the limb of MSH 15-52 (Seward & Harnden 1982, Seward et al. 1983). This paper will concentrate on the morphology of the synchrotron nebula."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:uAPFzskPt0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/pqex74wxkzaynhsdbsfn4qk75q/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C1C747376D6AE96C9CAA3F2C6E9F8B4F/S0252921100041853a.pdf/div-class-title-the-x-ray-synchrotron-nebula-around-psr-1509-58-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ATyuHa8EU38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
