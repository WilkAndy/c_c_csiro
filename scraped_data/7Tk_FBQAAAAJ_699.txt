The rationale behind these surveys was to use the great sensitivity of the 100-m telescope of the Max-Planck\u2014Institut fiir Radioastronomie in particular at high radio frequencies for a complete study of pulse pro\ufb01les.The recent advent of HEMT ampli\ufb01ers has improved the observational sen\u2014sitivity enormously. Using these new systems it was possible to obtain integrated pro\ufb01les of 183 pulsars at 1.4 GHz, 46 pulsars at 4.75 GHz and 24 pulsars at 10.6 GHz (see Seiradakis et al. 1995). Furthermore eight pulsars have been studied"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=434112613368317623&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
