The high quality light curve obtained using the ephemeris provided by the Nan\u00e7ay and Jodrell Bank radio telescopes shows two main peaks stable in phase with energy. The first \u03b3-ray peak leads the radio main pulse by (281\u00b112\u00b121) \u03bcs, giving new constraints on the production site of non-thermal emission in pulsar magnetospheres. The first uncertainty is due to \u03b3-ray statistics, and the second arises from the rotation parameters. The improved sensitivity and the unprecedented statistics afforded by the LAT enable precise measurement of the Crab Pulsar spectral parameters: cut-off energy at E c=(5.8\u00b10.5\u00b11.2) GeV, spectral index of \u0393=(1.97\u00b10.02\u00b10.06) and integral photon flux above 100 MeV of (2.09\u00b10.03\u00b10.18)\u00d7 10\u2212 6 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1.
