The pulsars are observed in three bands, centred close to 730, 1400 and 3100 MHz, using a dual-band 10\u2009cm/50\u2009cm receiver and the central beam of the 20-cm multibeam receiver. Observations spanning approximately six years have been carefully calibrated and summed to produce high S/N profiles. This allows us to study the individual profile components and in particular how they evolve with frequency. We also identify previously undetected profile features. For many pulsars we show that pulsed emission extends across almost the entire pulse profile. The pulse component widths and component separations follow a complex evolution with frequency; in some cases these parameters increase and in other cases they \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10910925578442911490", "cites_id": ["10910925578442911490"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/449/3/3223/2893033", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ai_QSQFla5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 17, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 19, "2020": 17, "2021": 21, "2022": 21, "2023": 11}}
