Accounting for the pulsar radiation ponderomotive force, the relativistic mass variation, and the plasma magnetization, we obtain a pair of nonlinear equations which exhibit coupling of pulsar radiation with the background plasma slow motions in magnetized plasmas. The modulational/filamentation instability as well as the localization of pulsar radiation are investigated. We conclude that our investigation is relevant to the microstructures in the pulsar magnetosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:aDl3D7KC1E4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/191859645.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qwRia-gleJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
