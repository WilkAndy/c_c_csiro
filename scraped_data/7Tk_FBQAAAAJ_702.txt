The polar cap shape is actually determined by a quadratic equation having two roots leading to two values of the polar angle, 9+ and 9~ with respect to the magnetic axis for a given azimuth< p. For the north pole both 9+ and 9~ branches are shown as polar plots in Fig. 1 for various inclination angles a and a typical pulsar period P= l/\\/2s. The discussion of pulsar polar caps hitherto (eg Biggs 1990) had not distinguished between the d+ and the0~ solutions. The region defined by the 9+ solution is completely contained inside the polar cap. It has a peculiar triangular shape whose lowest vertex is always on the magnetic axis. This naturally suggests an identification of the 0+ and the 9~ regions with the core and conal emission zones. This idetification leads to following consequences:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:In6cVmBjs0IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/192310297.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MgrD-4E1pFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
