Here we demonstrate that photons from pulsar B1641j45 stimulate pulses of excess 1720-megahertz line emission in an interstellar hydroxyl (OH) cloud. As this stimulated emission is driven by the pulsar, it varies on a few-millisecond time scale, which is orders of magnitude shorter than the quickest OH maser variations previously detected. Our 1612-megahertz spectra are inverted copies of the 1720-megahertz spectra. This \u2018\u2018conjugate line\u2019\u2019phenomenon enables us to constrain the properties of the interstellar OH line\u2013producing gas. We also show that pulsar signals undergo significantly deeper OH absorption than do other background sources, which confirms earlier tentative findings that OH clouds are clumpier on small scales than are neutral hydrogen clouds.Pulsars are outstanding tools for the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). Their pulsed signals undergo a variety of modifications as they propagate through the ISM, revealing extensive information about the global distribution and physical properties of the intervening material. The tiny sizes of pulsars ensure that their signals probe very small transverse scales in the ISM (1, 2). Another virtue of pulsar ISM measurements is that the pulsars cycle rapidly on and off, so that observations may be made contemporaneously in both the presence and absence of the pulse, and the properties of the medium can be precisely compared in these two states. For example, the comparison of neutral hydrogen (HI) spectra acquired during and between pulses leads to pulsar absorption spectra that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8288953473151339887&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bw3tXkRHCHMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
