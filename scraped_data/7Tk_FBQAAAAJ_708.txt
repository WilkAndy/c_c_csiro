This survey con rms that either there is a lack of pulsars in the Galactic Centre or that scattering is severe in the inner hundred parsecs. This proposition could be tested by surveys at higer observing frequencies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14828349619214559671&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tymVKmrhyM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
