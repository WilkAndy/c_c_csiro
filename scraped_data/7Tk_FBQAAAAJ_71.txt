ASKAP is one of the first radio telescopes to deploy phased array feed (PAF) technology on a large scale, giving it an instantaneous field of view that covers and is expected to facilitate great advances in our understanding of galaxy formation, cosmology, and radio transients while opening new parameter space for discovery of the unknown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:60iIaj97TE0C", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17359164593441443812", "cites_id": ["17359164593441443812"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/australian-square-kilometre-array-pathfinder-i-system-description/E1A1DC57B4850811F5624AD3E97C9C9E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5I-dlTkk6PAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 27, "2022": 69, "2023": 33}}
