The system has been extensively monitored at radio frequencies between 843 MHz and 8.4 GHz during its 1994 and 1997 periastron passages. Unpulsed radio emission is observed for about 100 days around periastron, varying on time scales as short as a day. The peak unpulsed flux density is-60 mJy at 1.4 GHz-about 100 times the unpulsed flux density at apastron, and--10 times the pulsed flux density (away from periastron). The emission is almost certainly produced via the interaction of the pulsar wind and the outflow from the Be star. The question we try to answer is"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Wq2b2clWBLsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/O-Skjaeraasen/publication/234174971_Transient_radio_emission_from_PSR_B1259-63/links/55e5b8e308aebdc0f58b639a/Transient-radio-emission-from-PSR-B1259-63.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DLQBKbo6YHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
