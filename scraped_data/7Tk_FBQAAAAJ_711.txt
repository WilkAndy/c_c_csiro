This theory is used to outline a model in which the T* injection spectrum of the Crab Nebula is satisfactorily accounted for. The same theory suggests a model of the \u201cwisp\u201d features in the Crab Nebula which accounts for these time vari-able features in the surface bightness as compressions associated with the magnetic overshoots within the shock structure. It is pointed out that this theory suggests observable variability in the high energy gamma rays from the Crab Nebula (e> 50 MeV)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Arons/publication/234287962_Pulsar_Winds/links/00b7d52a72aa615e83000000/Pulsar-Winds.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CrRECIbef-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
