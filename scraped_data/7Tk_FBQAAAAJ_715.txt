Very high energy gamma rays do not appear to be modulated with the pulsar period, which suggests that a major part of the VHE emission is not from the pulsar magnetosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/T-Kifune-2/publication/234221766_Very_High_Energy_Emission_from_Pulsars/links/548835790cf2ef34478f7a6f/Very-High-Energy-Emission-from-Pulsars.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yHttHAPKb5kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
