We briefly review a model for dynamical tidal evolution which shows that chaotic orbital evolution is possible, and list several applications to real systems. The system PSR J0045-7319 is then discussed, and a possible explanation for its decreasing orbital period is suggested."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/p3jvtlhmhvdedp6ly5kauc5pdy/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/972C329BAD33260CFF1D263D57793BF0/S0252921100042238a.pdf/div-class-title-tidal-interactions-in-pulsar-binaries-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:965tPw5W6zAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
