Much of the Key Science for the SKA calls for a fast survey speed at observing frequencies around 1 GHz.MIRANdA is an SKA demonstrator which achieves a fast survey speed through a combination of medium sized parabolic dishes equipped with focal plane arrays. The array will be located at Boolardy Station, Western Australia, in one of the most radio quiet regions on Earth and a potential site for hosting the SKA. Although only 1% of the final SKA specifications, MIRANdA is a front-line scientific instrument in its own right which attacks ground-breaking science questions directly relevant to the SKA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=aa09f76fbcc8217e123fb125324978d21bcd5d7c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E1rAmlNARn4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
