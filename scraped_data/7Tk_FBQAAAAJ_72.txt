Three of the pulsars, PSRs J1024-0719, J1744-1134, and J2124-3358, are close to the Sun (d< 360 pc) and have very low luminosities, \u2272 0.5 mJy kpc 2. The other, PSR J0711-6830, is of intermediate luminosity. The four least luminous millisecond pulsars presently known are all isolated objects, even though more than 75% of the known disk millisecond pulsars are binary. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis confirms that the luminosity distributions of the binary and isolated millisecond pulsars are different at the 99.5% confidence level. We can find no simple explanation for this fact. The low-luminosity millisecond pulsars reported here exacerbate the birthrate discrepancy with their assumed progenitors, the low-mass X-ray binaries. None of the pulsars exhibits any evidence of a planetary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16359633916911032217", "cites_id": ["16359633916911032217"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/304041/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mRfq0F4YCeMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 10, "1999": 9, "2000": 5, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 0, "2006": 10, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
