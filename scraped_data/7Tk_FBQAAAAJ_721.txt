If the hypothesis is true, then a separate class of compact stars could exist, which are called strange matter stars. The properties of the complete sequence of such stars, which range from compact neutron-star-like strange stars to strange dwarfs to strange planets. The latter two constitute the strange counterparts of ordinary white dwarfs and planets, respectively. The properties of these objects are discussed in this paper."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42842807/Neutron_stars_strange_pulsars_and_strang20160219-19490-1p76esv.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5EEG-FtuLIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
