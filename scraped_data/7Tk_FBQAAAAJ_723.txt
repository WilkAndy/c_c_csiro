We present the latest timing parameters for the system, including a signi\ufb01cant change in the projected semi-major axis of the inner binary, a marginal detection of the fourth time derivative of the pulse frequency, and the pulsar proper motion (which is in agreement with published values for the proper motion of M4), and use them to further constrain the mass mg and the orbital parameters. Using the observed value of we obtain a one-parameter family of solutions, all with mg 3 10\" 2 M@, ie, excluding stellar masses.Varying within its formal la error bar does not affect the mass range signi\ufb01cantly. However, if we vary f within a 40 error bar, we \ufb01nd that stellar-mass solutions are still possible.
