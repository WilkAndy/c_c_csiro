The computing requirements dictate that this survey would be insensitive to millisecond pulsars with periods less than about 25 ms. However, the survey would detect some 1600 pulsars of which about half would be new discoveries. A number of these could be exotic objects, such as double neutron star system, pulsars with high mass companions, mildly relativistic pulsars and perhaps even a pulsar-black hole system. The survey would also be sensitive to transients, particularly to those such as occur in the newly discovered RRAT objects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/mira/newdocs/psr_survey.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
