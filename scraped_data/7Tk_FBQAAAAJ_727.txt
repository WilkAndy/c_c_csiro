Such events can be used as tools to resolve the emission regions in pulsar magnetospheres. Results from recent observations of a double imaging event for PSR B1133+ 16 are described. Significant fringe phase variations are seen across the pulse. The minimum value for the trans-verse separation of the emitting regions at the two edges of the pulse is inferred to be== 5 x 10 m. These results are compared with earlier values reported in literature and the implications are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yashwant-Gupta-2/publication/234337686_Multiple_Imaging_of_Pulsars_by_the_ISM/links/5455daa50cf2cf51647ddffe/Multiple-Imaging-of-Pulsars-by-the-ISM.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nfQtnrxpCuEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
