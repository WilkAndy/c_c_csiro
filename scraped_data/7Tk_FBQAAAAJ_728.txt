Several maser emission mechanism are viable for ROP1, where radius-to-frequency mapping applies. Suggested Schott radiation from outside the LC is discussed critically."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17835472242697256667&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2z5PI4JThPcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
