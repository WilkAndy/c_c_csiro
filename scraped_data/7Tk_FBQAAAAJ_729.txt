The calculations are performed in a Schwarzschild metric, thereby including redshift and field enhancement effects associated with curved spacetime. We find that pair production and splitting totally inhibit emission above around 10-30 MeV in PSR1509-58, whose surface field is inferred to be as high as 3 X 1013 Gauss. Model pulsar spectra of splitting cascades for high field cases, where splitting is important, are consistent with the very low cutoff energy in PSR1509-58 for a wide range of polar cap sizes.The spectra of 7-ray pulsars generally are observed to cutoff above a few GeV (eg Thompson, this volume). PSR1509-58 stands out as having both an unusually low spectral cutoff energy and the highest inferred surface magnetic field (3 X 1013 Gauss). It has been detected by only the CGRO instruments (see Fig. 1 caption for references) operating in the lowest energy bands, BATSE and OSSE, with the higher energy instruments, COMPTEL and EGRET, giving upper limits that require a cutoff or turnover between 2 and 30 MeV. A natural question then arises: does the high field of this pulsar cause its spectrum to differ so much from that of the other 7-ray pulsars? Gamma-rays from pulsars can be efficiently attenuated in their magnetospheres via the mechanism of single-photon pair production and also the exotic QED process of photon splitting, which become prolific in fields approaching the quantum critical value of 4.41 X 1013 Gauss. Photon splitting 7-> 77, will operate in the high field regions near pulsar polar caps \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/u76jzbstzjhcvgn6uem4nulkhe/access/wayback/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7DD6BDD80DDCCE839A7A8F5DF2BFD021/S0252921100041877a.pdf/div-class-title-the-attenuation-of-hard-rays-in-strongly-magnetized-pulsars-div.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hf7kgVdtH_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
