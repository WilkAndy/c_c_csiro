We report here on extensive multifrequency radio observations of the pulsar from 1993 August to 1994 October, which show large changes in its flux density, linear polarization, dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), often on short time-scales. For five weeks centred on the periastron epoch of 1994 January 9 (MJD 49361.2), no pulsed flux was detected. This is most likely due to a combination of free-free absorption and severe pulse scattering in the Be-star disc, even at frequencies as high as 8.4 GHz. In the week before the eclipse, the DM increased by \u223c10cm\u22123pc and the amount of pulse scattering rapidly increased. Following the re-appearance of the pulsed emission in 1994 February, the DM had returned to normal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11778452434816447016", "cites_id": ["11778452434816447016"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/279/3/1026/967531", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KLIRpRV4daMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 6, "2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 10, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 8}}
