Timing observations of this pulsar, made over a 4.8 yr interval using the Parkes radio telescope, cover two periastron passages, in 1990 August, and 1994 January. The timing data cannot be tted by the normal pulsar and Keplerian binary parameters but are well tted by a model which includes pulsar spin-down episodes at each periastron. The most likely explanation is that the pulsar is interacting with the circumstellar disk of SS2883 via the propellor mechanism."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6640853926620428040&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CPd3JXYNKVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
