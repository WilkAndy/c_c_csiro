We have discovered two startling features in the 1413 MHz single-pulse data. The first is the presence of giant micropulses that are confined to the leading edge of the pulse profile. One of these pulses has a peak flux density in excess of 2500 Jy, more than 40 times the integrated pulse peak. The second new result is the presence of a large-amplitude Gaussian component on the trailing edge of the pulse profile. This component can exceed the main pulse in intensity but is switched on only relatively rarely. Fluctuation spectra reveal a possible periodicity in this feature of 140 pulse periods. Unlike the rest of the profile, this component has low net polarization and emits predominantly in the orthogonal mode. This feature appears \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=979252108197056873", "cites_id": ["979252108197056873"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/319154/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aVGjppoAlw0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 14, "2004": 10, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 9, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
