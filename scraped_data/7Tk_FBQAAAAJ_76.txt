Unpulsed radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emission observed from the binary system is thought to be due to the collision of pulsar wind with the wind of Be star. We present here the results of new XMM\u2013Newton observations of the PSR B1259\u221263 system during the beginning of 2004 as the pulsar approached the disc of the Be star. We combine these results with the earlier unpublished X-ray data from BeppoSAX and XMM\u2013Newton as well as with the ASCA data. The detailed X-ray light curve of the system shows that the pulsar passes (twice per orbit) through a well-defined Gaussian-profile disc with the half-opening angle (projected on the pulsar orbit plane) . The intersection of the disc middle plane with the pulsar orbital plane is inclined at \u03b8disc\u2243 70\u00b0 to the major axis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8614176953068743397", "cites_id": ["8614176953068743397"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/367/3/1201/1041377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5eoEiEy0i3cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 5, "2009": 11, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 13, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 13, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
