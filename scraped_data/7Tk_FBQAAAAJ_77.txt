In this paper we present VAST, an ASKAP survey for Variables and Slow Transients. VAST will exploit the wide-field survey capabilities of ASKAP to enable the discovery and investigation of variable and transient phenomena from the local to the cosmological, including flare stars, intermittent pulsars, X-ray binaries, magnetars, extreme scattering events, interstellar scintillation, radio supernovae, and orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. In addition, it will allow us to probe unexplored regions of parameter space where new classes of transient sources may be detected. In this paper we review the known radio transient and variable populations and the current results from blind radio surveys. We outline a comprehensive program based on a multi-tiered survey \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9272367030652261202", "cites_id": ["9272367030652261202"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/vast-an-askap-survey-for-variables-and-slow-transients/E4E1BEB867290973BCB7C28AB2C5E241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UlMS8a8QroAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 8, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 14, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 17, "2020": 8, "2021": 16, "2022": 11, "2023": 8}}
