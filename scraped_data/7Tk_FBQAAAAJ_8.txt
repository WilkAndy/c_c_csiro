Installation of a digital backend allows us to record 400 MHz of bandwidth for each beam, split into 1024 channels and sampled every 64 \u03bcs. Limits of the receiver package restrict us to a 340 MHz observing band centred at 1352 MHz. The factor of 8 improvement in frequency resolution over previous multibeam surveys allows us to probe deeper into the Galactic plane for short-duration signals such as the pulses from millisecond pulsars. We plan to survey the entire southern sky in 42 641 pointings, split into low, mid and high Galactic latitude regions, with integration times of 4200, 540 and 270 s, respectively. Simulations suggest that we will discover 400 pulsars, of which 75 will be millisecond pulsars.
