The new formula negates the need to measure the second time derivative of the rotation frequency, . We show that the method gives similar braking indices for PSR B1509\u221258 and the Crab pulsar to those already in the literature. We point out that our method is useful for obtaining the braking indices of moderate-aged pulsars without the need for long, phase-connected timing solutions. We applied the method to 20 pulsars and discuss the implications of the results. We find that virtually all the derived braking indices are dominated by the effects of (unseen) glitches, the recovery from which corrupts the value of . However, any real, large, positive braking index has implications for magnetic field decay and offers support to recent models of pulsar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11236685154186423521", "cites_id": ["11236685154186423521"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/306/4/L50/963967", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4ewv_Jy58JsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 8, "2002": 7, "2003": 1, "2004": 7, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
