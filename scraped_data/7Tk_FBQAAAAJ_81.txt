In the first model, the DM and RM variations are produced by an ionized, radiatively driven, coronal wind from SS2883. The electron density ne and magnetic field B vary as power laws with distance r from SS2883, and the wind terminates where it collides with the relativistic, electron-positron wind from PSR B1259 \u2013 63. It is shown that this model - popular in the literature -cannot reproduce the observed pre-periastron rise in DM unless one has , with  at the stellar surface, contrary to the predictions of dynamical wind theories. In the second model, the DM and RM variations are due to a cool, dense, circumstellar disc with an exponential density \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18003050093478991039", "cites_id": ["18003050093478991039"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/275/2/381/2896129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v9Rg_6yu1_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 6, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 8, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
