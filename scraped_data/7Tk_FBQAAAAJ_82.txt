Using 1 yr of survey data with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT), we detected pulsations from PSR B1509\u2212 58 up to 1 GeV and extended \u03b3-ray emission above 1 GeV spatially coincident with the PWN. The pulsar light curve presents two peaks offset from the radio peak by phases 0.96\u00b10.01 and 0.33\u00b10.02. New constraining upper limits on the pulsar emission are derived below 1 GeV and confirm a severe spectral break at a few tens of MeV. The nebular spectrum in the 1\u2013100 GeV energy range is well described by a power law with a spectral index of (1.57\u00b10.17\u00b10.13) and a flux above 1 GeV of (2.91\u00b10.79\u00b11.35)\u00d7 10\u2212 9 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1.
