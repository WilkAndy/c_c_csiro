Timing observations with Fermi result in a precise position determination for the pulsar of RA= 19 h 07 m 54 fs 7 (2), decl.=+ 06 02'16 (2)''placing the pulsar firmly within the TeV source extent, suggesting the TeV source is the pulsar wind nebula of PSR J1907+ 0602. Pulsed \u03b3-ray emission is clearly visible at energies from 100 MeV to above 10 GeV. The phase-averaged power-law index in the energy range E> 0.1 GeV is \u0393= 1.76\u00b10.05 with an exponential cutoff energy E c= 3.6\u00b10.5 GeV. We present the energy-dependent \u03b3-ray pulsed light curve as well as limits on off-pulse emission associated with the TeV source. We also report the detection of very faint (flux density of\u2243 3.4 \u03bcJy) radio pulsations with the Arecibo telescope at 1.5 GHz having a dispersion measure DM= 82.1\u00b11.1 cm\u2212 3 pc.
