MeerKAT is a high-gain ( ) low-system temperature ( ) radio array that currently operates at 580\u20131 670 MHz and can produce tied-array beams suitable for pulsar observations. This paper presents results from the MeerTime Large Survey Project and commissioning tests with PTUSE. Highlights include observations of the double pulsar , pulse profiles from 34 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from a single 2.5-h observation of the Globular cluster Terzan 5, the rotation measure of Ter5O, a 420-sigma giant pulse from the Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar PSR , and nulling identified in the slow pulsar PSR J0633\u20132015. One of the key design specifications for MeerKAT was absolute timing errors of less than 5 ns using their novel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:Y0-TYkg6YM4C", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2025915757387985358", "cites_id": ["2025915757387985358"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/meerkat-telescope-as-a-pulsar-facility-system-verification-and-early-science-results-from-meertime/A0ED62920EA3207804981FA721B912DF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zjH6x6V_HRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 8, "2021": 38, "2022": 43, "2023": 24}}
