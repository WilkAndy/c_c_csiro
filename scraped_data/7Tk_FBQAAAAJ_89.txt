The two millisecond pulsars, PSRs J2017+ 0603 and J2302+ 4442, have rotational periods of 2.896 and 5.192 ms and are both in binary systems with low-eccentricity orbits and orbital periods of 2.2 and 125.9 days, respectively, suggesting long recycling processes. Gamma-ray pulsations were subsequently detected for both objects, indicating that they power the associated Fermi sources in which they were found. The gamma-ray light curves and spectral properties are similar to those of previously detected gamma-ray millisecond pulsars. Detailed modeling of the observed radio and gamma-ray light curves shows that the gamma-ray emission seems to originate at high altitudes in their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7997812372195043796", "cites_id": ["7997812372195043796"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/732/1/47/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1OnocPrv_W4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 12, "2012": 20, "2013": 18, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
