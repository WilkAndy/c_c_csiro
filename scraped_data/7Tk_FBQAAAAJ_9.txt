The 16-fold increase in observing bandwidth, from 2 \u00d7 128 to 2 \u00d7 2048 MHz, high-bit sampling and the addition of 16 zoom windows (each divided into further 2048 channels) provide major improvements for all ATCA observations. The benefits of the new system are: (1) hugely increased radio continuum and polarization sensitivity as well as image fidelity; (2) substantially improved capability to search for and map emission and absorption lines over large velocity ranges; (3) simultaneous multi-line and continuum observations; (4) increased sensitivity, survey speed and dynamic range due to high-bit sampling and (5) high-velocity resolution, while maintaining full polarization output. The new CABB system encourages all observers to make use of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC", "num_citations": 407, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15082092095404415256", "cites_id": ["15082092095404415256"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/416/2/832/1054363", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GJlOONpaTtEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 34, "2013": 36, "2014": 31, "2015": 50, "2016": 38, "2017": 44, "2018": 38, "2019": 32, "2020": 27, "2021": 36, "2022": 28, "2023": 8}}
