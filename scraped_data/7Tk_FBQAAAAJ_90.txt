The burst was detected in real time with a dispersion measure (DM) of 1105.6 \u00b1 0.8 pc cm\u22123, a pulse duration of 2.8 ms, and a measured peak flux density assuming that the burst was at beam centre of 0.7 Jy. The FRB originated at a Galactic longitude and latitude of 24.66\u00b0, 5.28\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 away from the Galactic Center. The burst was found to be 43 \u00b1 5\u2009per\u2009cent linearly polarized with a rotation measure (RM) in the range \u22129 < RM < 12\u2009rad\u2009m\u22122 (95\u2009per\u2009cent confidence level), consistent with zero. The burst was followed up with 11 telescopes to search for radio, optical, X-ray, \u03b3-ray and neutrino emission. Neither transient nor variable emission was found to be associated with the burst and no repeat pulses have been observed in 17.25 h of observing.
