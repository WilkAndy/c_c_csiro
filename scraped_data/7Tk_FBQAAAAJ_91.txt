This conclusion appears to be unavoidable, even when non-circular beams are considered. Allowing the magnetic axis to align from a random distribution at birth with a time-scale of \u223c7 \u00d7 107 yr can, however, explain those observations well. The time-scale derived is consistent with that obtained via independent methods. The probability that a pulsar beam intersects the line of sight is a function of the angle \u03b1 and therefore beam evolution has important consequences for evolutionary models and for estimations of the total number of neutron stars. The validity of the standard formula for the spin-down rate, which is independent of \u03b1, appears to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17291660972895378084", "cites_id": ["17291660972895378084"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/387/4/1755/1093843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pBrqKQpS-O8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 17, "2011": 11, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
