The HTRU survey\u2019s single-pulse search, the software designed to perform the search and a determination of the HTRU survey\u2019s sensitivity to single pulses are described. Initial processing of a small fraction of the survey has produced 11 discoveries, all of which are sparsely emitting neutron stars, as well as provided confirmation of two previously unconfirmed neutron stars. Most of the newly discovered objects lie in regions surveyed previously, indicating both the improved sensitivity of the HTRU survey observing system and the dynamic nature of the radio sky. The cycles of active and null states in nulling pulsars, rotating radio transients (RRATs) and long-term intermittent pulsars are explored in the context of determining the relationship between these populations and of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=662405675087904259", "cites_id": ["662405675087904259"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/416/4/2465/974351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Az7RsHNWMQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 13, "2013": 12, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
