At first, our study considers only pulsar characteristic ages, resulting in no change in the degree of correlation as a function of age, up to at least 100\u2009Myr. Subsequently, we consider a more reliable estimate of pulsar age, the kinematic age, assuming that pulsars are born near the Galactic plane. We derive kinematic ages for 52 pulsars, based on the measured pulsar proper motions and positions, by modelling the trajectory of the pulsars in a Galactic potential. The sample of 52 pulsar kinematic ages constitutes the largest number of independently estimated pulsar ages to date. Using only the 33 most reliable kinematic ages from our simulations, we revisit the evolution of spin\u2013velocity alignment, this time as a function of kinematic age.
