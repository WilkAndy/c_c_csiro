We selected the 315 pulsars detected in a single-pulse search of this survey, allowing a large sample unbiased regarding any rotational parameters of neutron stars. We found that the energy distribution of many pulsars is well described by a log-normal distribution, with few deviating from a small range in log-normal scale and location parameters. Some pulsars exhibited multiple energy states corresponding to mode changes, and implying that some observed \u2018nulling\u2019 may actually be a mode-change effect. PSR J1900\u22122600 was found to emit weakly in its previously identified \u2018null\u2019 state. We found evidence for another state-change effect in two pulsars, which show bimodality in their nulling time-scales; that is, they \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17076116832905143025", "cites_id": ["17076116832905143025"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/423/2/1351/961934", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8SJhUMmN-uwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 10, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 10, "2021": 15, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
