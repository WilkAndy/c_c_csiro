Periodicity searches of these data have discovered two millisecond pulsars, PSR J1103\u22125403 (1FGL J1103.9\u22125355) and PSR J2241\u22125236 (1FGL J2241.9\u22125236), and a long-period pulsar, PSR J1604\u221244 (1FGL J1604.7\u22124443). In addition, we searched for but did not detect any radio pulsations from six gamma-ray pulsars discovered by the Fermi satellite to a level of \u223c0.04 mJy (for pulsars with a 10 per cent duty cycle).The timing of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1103\u22125403 has shown that its position is 9 arcmin from the centroid of the gamma-ray source. Since these observations were carried out, independent evidence has shown that 1FGL J1103.9\u22125355 is associated with the flat spectrum radio source PKS 1101\u2212536. It appears certain that the pulsar is not associated with the gamma \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12348352322303873955", "cites_id": ["12348352322303873955"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/414/2/1292/977337", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o9NKRAMpXqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 23, "2013": 16, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
