Here, we use archival data to present polarimetry data at an observing frequency of 1.4 GHz for 600 pulsars with spin-periods ranging from 0.036 to 8.5\u2009s. We comment briefly on some of the statistical implications from the data and highlight the differences between pulsars with high and low spin-down energy. The data set, images and table of properties for all 600 pulsars are made available in a public data archive maintained by the CSIRO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7Tk_FBQAAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13724908283670206028", "cites_id": ["13724908283670206028"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/474/4/4629/4705909", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TJb6xl2reL4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 21, "2020": 21, "2021": 22, "2022": 21, "2023": 10}}
