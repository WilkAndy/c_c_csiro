It remains uncertain, however, to what extent temperature and water availability control the carbon balance of land ecosystems across spatial and temporal scales,,,,,,,,,,,. Here we use empirical models based on eddy covariance data and process-based models, to investigate the effect of changes in temperature and water availability on gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at local and global scales. We find that water availability is the dominant driver of the local interannual variability in GPP and TER. To a lesser extent this is true also for NEE at the local scale, but when integrated globally, temporal NEE variability is mostly driven by temperature fluctuations. We suggest that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:Ol96Buz8XVoC", "num_citations": 508, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15752562685542250875", "cites_id": ["15752562685542250875"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20780", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e7nRRU1YnNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 30, "2018": 75, "2019": 76, "2020": 100, "2021": 79, "2022": 108, "2023": 34}}
