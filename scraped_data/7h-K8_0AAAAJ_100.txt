All parameters for a biochemical photosynthetic model of Sitka spruce shoots were obtained from responses of CO2 assimilation to quantum flux density and CO2 concentration. Comparable parameters for needles on a shoot were derived using a shoot structure model. 2. Photosynthetic response of a shoot to absorbed quantum flux density was not satisfactorily predicted using the biochemical model unless co-limitation by potential electron transport and Rubisco was taken into account. Co-limitation of a shoot is affected by the absorbed quantum flux density and ambient CO2 concentration, as well as by the structure of the shoot. Shoots grown in the forest were structurally acclimated to the environment and were able to use the absorbed quantum flux density more efficiently than shoots of seedlings grown in a growth room. The heterogeneous distribution of shoots in a canopy can further increase co-limitation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15972551967390913223", "cites_id": ["15972551967390913223"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2390031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x1LNXGPnqd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
