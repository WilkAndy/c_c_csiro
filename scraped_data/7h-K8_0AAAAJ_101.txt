Many of those parameters are poorly constrained and are therefore very uncertain. Usually only a few of the parameters are responsible for changes in the model output of interest. Identifying those parameters that have a significant effect on the model output is an important step before applying parameter estimation methods using observations. However this has not been done systematically for any global LSMs yet, because of the computational costs involved. Here, we introduce a global sensitivity analysis method that is widely used in chemical engineering. This method includes two steps: a screening step that ranks all model parameters by their importance on model output in order to select the potentially important parameters and a second step that aims to quantify the contribution to the variance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6065728877803713235", "cites_id": ["6065728877803713235"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192313000804", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:07JR2UbMLVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 12, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 6}}
