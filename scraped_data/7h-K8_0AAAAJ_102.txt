Using the McKendrick\u2013von F\u00f6rster equation, we show that the mean ages of mass in a compartmental system satisfy a linear nonautonomous ordinary differential equation that is exponentially stable. We then define a nonautonomous version of transit time as the mean age of mass leaving the compartmental system at a particular time and show that our nonautonomous theory generalises the autonomous case. We apply these results to study a nine-dimensional nonautonomous compartmental system modeling the terrestrial carbon cycle, which is a modification of the Carnegie\u2013Ames\u2013Stanford approach model, and we demonstrate that the nonautonomous versions of transit time and mean age differ significantly from the autonomous quantities when calculated for that model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:z-xpeKpFZ3wC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4148906579278042879", "cites_id": ["4148906579278042879"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-016-0990-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_xYmUI3gkzkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 13, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 2, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
