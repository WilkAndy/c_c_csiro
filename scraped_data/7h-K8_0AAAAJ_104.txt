The two treatments were control and liming (to reduce soil acidity). These trace gas fluxes were also simulated using a revised version of the process\u2010based model DNDC. Our version of the DNDC (Denitrification and Decomposition) model has been significantly modified by including a surface energy balance submodel; by using more comprehensive formulations for soil evaporation, plant transpiration, plant growth, and plant nitrogen uptake; by using an implicit difference scheme to solve the diffusion equations governing heat and water fluxes in the soil; and by initializing the soil organic carbon in different pools using their relative proportions at the steady state.
