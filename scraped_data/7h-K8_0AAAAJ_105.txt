These effects generally differ among different forests, and the dominant mechanisms for those observed responses often vary, depending on climate, soil conditions and vegetation types. Using soil monoliths (0\u201340 cm) from pine forest (pioneer), coniferous and broadleaved mixed forest (transitional) and broadleaved forest (mature) in southern China, we conducted a leaching experiment with acid treatments at different pH levels (control: pH \u2248 4.5; pH = 3.5; pH = 2.5). We found that pH 3.5 treatment significantly reduced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in leachate from the pioneer forest soil. pH 2.5 treatment significantly increased concentrations of NO3\u2212, SO42 \u2212, Ca2 +, Mg2 +, Al3 +, Fe3 + and DOC in leachate from the pioneer forest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:qtIad817JNcC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13360799005614636764", "cites_id": ["13360799005614636764"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716309019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3H4NNegXa7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 7}}
