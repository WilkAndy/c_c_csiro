The first technique involves an automatic chamber capable of running at remote, unpowered, unattended sites. The air samples collected from individual flux measurements are progressively added to holding volumes, essentially averaging the concentrations in the accumulated air samples before their chemical analysis. This technique allows the continuous measurement of trace gas exchange at multiple distant remote sites to be carried out by one or two persons operating from a central laboratory housing the analytical facilities. The scientific advantages of this method are that emission measurements are automated, integrated day and night, and can be carried out at remote locations without mains power. The second technique involves continuous online analysis of the chamber headspace once per minute by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. This technique provides simultaneous measurement of CO2, N2O and CH4, is suitable for use at well supported measurement sites, and allows the continuous, automated determination of trace gas exchange measurements on a half hourly or hourly basis. The underlying theoretical and experimental basis of the use of chambers to measure trace gas exchange over soil/plant surfaces is presented. Measurements are presented from the OASIS (Observations At Several Interacting Scales), field experiment. The temperature and soil moisture responses of soil/plant respiration, N2O emissions and CH4 uptake are observed and quantified. Both approaches produced comparable results \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15447553139968095924", "cites_id": ["15447553139968095924"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/meyer_2001a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tLbEdLy7YNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 7, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 1}}
