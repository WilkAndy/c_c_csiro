A significant fraction of the global soil\u2013atmosphere exchange for climatically active gases occurs in semiarid and arid zones yet little is known about these exchanges. A study was made of the soil\u2013atmosphere exchange of CH4, CO, N2O and NOx in the semiarid Mallee system, in north\u2010western Victoria, Australia, at two sites: one pristine mallee and the other cleared for approximately 65 years for farming (currently wheat). The mean (\u00b1 standard error) rates of CH4 exchange were uptakes of \u22123.0 \u00b1 0.5\u2003ng(C)\u2003m\u22122\u2003s\u22121 for the Mallee and \u22126.0 \u00b1 0.3\u2003ng(C)\u2003m\u22122\u2003s\u22121 for the Wheat. Converting mallee forest to wheat crop increases CH4 uptake significantly. CH4 emissions were observed in the Mallee in summer and were hypothesized to arise from termite activity.
