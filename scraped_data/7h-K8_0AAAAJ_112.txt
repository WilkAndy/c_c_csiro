However, it is still unknown whether previously observed relationship between soil respiration (Rs) and precipitation remains applicable under extreme precipitation change. By analyzing the observations from a much larger dataset of field experiments (248 published papers including 151 grassland studies and 97 forest studies) across a wider range of precipitation manipulation than previous studies, we found that the relationship of Rs response with precipitation change was highly nonlinear or asymmetric, and differed significantly between grasslands and forests, between moderate and extreme precipitation changes. Response of Rs to precipitation change was negatively asymmetric (concave\u2010down) in grasslands, and double\u2010asymmetric in forests with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ksVBBY9DlqUC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10048385653126178818", "cites_id": ["10048385653126178818"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15270", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Aqi3TIMJc4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 11, "2022": 13, "2023": 14}}
