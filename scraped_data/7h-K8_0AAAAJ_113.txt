Nonetheless, our understanding of nutrient controls remains far from complete and poorly quantified, at least partly due to a lack of informative, comparable, and accessible datasets at regional-to-global scales. A growing research infrastructure of multi-site networks are providing valuable data on C fluxes and stocks and are monitoring their responses to global environmental change and measuring responses to experimental treatments. These networks thus provide an opportunity for improving our understanding of C-nutrient cycle interactions and our ability to model them. However, coherent information on how nutrient cycling interacts with observed C cycle patterns is still generally lacking. Here, we argue \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:324HgoyA9qIC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15550448593466247240", "cites_id": ["15550448593466247240"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaeae7/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SEiHH5tKztcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
