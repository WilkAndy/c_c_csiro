The concentration data are inverted using a Bayesian synthesis method, to test whether the CO2 fluxes can be successfully retrieved at monthly temporal resolution. The inversion is performed globally (with a base network of about 100 sites), but the tests focus on the Australian continent, subdivided into 12 regions. The inversion is tested using dense networks of approximately 40 new sites in and around Australia. Land\u2010based and offshore networks are compared. The land\u2010based network produces biased source estimates, for regions with large diurnal source variability, if the inversion only solves for a constant flux throughout the month. The bias is eliminated when we solve for two fluxes for each region, a constant monthly flux and a daytime\u2010only flux.
