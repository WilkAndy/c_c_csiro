However, it remains unclear how the carbon allocation pattern has changed at global scale and impacted terrestrial carbon uptake. Based on the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model, this study shows the increasing partitioning ratios to leaf and wood and reducing ratio to root globally from 1979 to 2014. The results imply the plant optimizes carbon allocation and reaches its maximum growth by allocating more newly acquired photosynthate to leaves and wood tissues. Thus, terrestrial vegetation has absorbed 16% more carbon averagely between 1979 and 2014 through adjusting their carbon allocation process. Compared with the fixed carbon allocation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:8Wqc2CfJRaAC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15519940201995974460", "cites_id": ["15519940201995974460"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03574-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PDdGs2LnYdcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 15, "2023": 1}}
