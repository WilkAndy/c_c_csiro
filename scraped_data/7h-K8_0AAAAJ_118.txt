These estimates were refined by applying the synthesis filtering technique to in situ surface CH4 concentrations measured at Cape Grim, (40.68\u00b0S,144.68\u00b0E). The refined estimates are 65, 249 and 1502 Gg yr \u22121, respectively, with uncertainties of the estimates being reduced by 25%, 50% and 80%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that the inversion results do not change significantly under a range of assumptions. The inventory is therefore considered to significantly overestimate net emissions from central-south and southeast Australia in 1997. We also conclude that in situ CH4 concentration measurements can provide definite constraints for estimating regional CH4 emissions in Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4392909983935491204", "cites_id": ["4392909983935491204"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231002005897", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hOy9ElvA9jwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
