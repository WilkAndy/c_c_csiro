Model description and comparison with a multi-layered model. Agric. For. Meterol. 91, 81\u2013111] usually overestimates the hourly photosynthesis, latent heat flux and canopy conductance of sunlit leaves, and underestimates the hourly sensible heat fluxes compared to a more detailed multi-layer model. In all cases errors on average were <5%. Here I present a refinement to the two-leaf model that reduces discrepancies between the two-leaf and multi-layered models to <3% while increasing by less than 1% the computing time required when the two-leaf model is used as the surface scheme in a climate model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12488035433761744505", "cites_id": ["12488035433761744505"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192399001653", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eSbcAxBqTq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
