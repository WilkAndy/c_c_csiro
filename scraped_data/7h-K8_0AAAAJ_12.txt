Improving soil C projections is of a high priority for Earth system modeling in the future IPCC and other assessments. To achieve this goal, we suggest that (1) model structures should reflect real\u2010world processes, (2) parameters should be calibrated to match model outputs with observations, and (3) external forcing variables should accurately prescribe the environmental conditions that soils experience. First, most soil C cycle models simulate C input from litter production and C release through decomposition. The latter process has traditionally been represented by first\u2010order decay functions, regulated primarily by temperature, moisture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:4DUywrCQPfoC", "num_citations": 369, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13311104264986287459", "cites_id": ["13311104264986287459"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015gb005239", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y92xws2KurgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 19, "2017": 37, "2018": 65, "2019": 64, "2020": 57, "2021": 55, "2022": 51, "2023": 20}}
