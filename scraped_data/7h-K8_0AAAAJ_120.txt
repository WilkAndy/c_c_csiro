Here, we use a global land\u2010surface model (CABLE) with three different approaches for estimating the responses of BNF to CO2, climate, and N deposition through Year 2100, particularly the linear versus nonlinear dependence of BNF on C investment and the temperature dependence of BNF. From 1900 to 2100, the cumulative rise in BNF varied from 1.6 to 3.0 Pg N, translating to an increase in terrestrial carbon (C) storage between 33 and 68 Pg C. This range reflects the different approaches used to model BNF (i.e., C\u2010limited vs. resource optimization approaches), indicating major uncertainties in C\u2010climate\u2010N interactions in Earth system model forecasts.
