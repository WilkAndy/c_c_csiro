A series of offline experiments were conducted using the forcing data from the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2) for the period of 1986\u201395, but with its default parameter settings. Results were compared against GSWP-2 multimodel ensembles and a range of observationally driven datasets. CABLE-simulated global mean evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff agreed well with the GSWP-2 multimodel climatology and observations, and the spatial variations of ET and runoff across 150 large catchments were well captured. Nevertheless, at regional scales it underestimated ET in the tropics and had some significant runoff errors. The model sensitivity to a number of selected parameters is further examined.
