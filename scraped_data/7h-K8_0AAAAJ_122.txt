Different genotypes were simulated by varying the duration from sowing to stem extension and/or from sowing to anthesis. It was found that long-season genotypes have more variable grain yield than short-season ones. An increase in [CO2] alone was shown to increase mean crop yield by 10\u201330% with little effect on variability, whereas a 3\u00b0C increase in temperature alone would reduce mean crop yield by up to 50% and its coefficient of variation by up to 30%. Optimal genotypes were identified that minimise the variability of yield while exceeding a yield threshold specified for each location. These optima will maintain the present yield variability or increase the mean crop yield for relatively longer-season genotype under warmer, higher CO2 conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7502013992898944422", "cites_id": ["7502013992898944422"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168192395022716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pl3AqvqBHGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
