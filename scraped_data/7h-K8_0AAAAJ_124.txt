For each RCP, we performed simulations with and without LULCC using the carbon (C only) mode or including the full C, N and P cycles (CNP). We show, for the first time, that inclusion of N and P cycling reduces both the carbon uptake from reforestation in RCP4. 5 and the carbon emission from deforestation in RCP8. 5. Specifically, carbon-nutrient interaction reduces carbon uptake in RCP4. 5 from 55 Pg C (C only) to 21 Pg C (CNP), or the emissions in RCP8. 5 from 72 Pg C (C only) to 56 Pg C (CNP). Most of those reductions result from much weaker responses of net primary production to CO 2 fertilization and climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:kVZqXsXrJl0C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13554965683540226254", "cites_id": ["13554965683540226254"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/1/014001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:znAGznjpHLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
