He has published on a wide range of topics including the role of dispersal in the dynamics and structure of plant communities, latitudinal and elevational gradients in biodiversity, and ocean and terrestrial ecosystem models for use in studies of the global carbon cycle and global climate change. His current research focuses on the development and application of mathematical models to address issues such as the sustainability of land-use practices, the effects of disturbances on ecosystem structure and function, and interactions between the biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:HoDPlbN_d1QC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11494018442998798247", "cites_id": ["11494018442998798247"], "pub_url": "https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1487&context=earthsci_facpub", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p1e7QOD0gp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
