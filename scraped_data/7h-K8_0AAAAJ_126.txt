Previous studies explained the adaptive advantages of different strategies on the basis of environmental climatic limits, but could not account for the observed co\u2010dominance of multiple plant functional types (PFTs) in many regions. Here we used a process\u2010based model to explore whether observed inter\u2010 and intra\u2010PFT variation in plant traits can explain global biogeographical variation in the dominance and co\u2010dominance of major forest types.World\u2010wide.We identified four important plant traits: leaf N concentration, leaf life span, fraction of net primary production (NPP) allocated to leaves and plant basal respiration rate. We incorporated means and variances of these plant traits from trait databases into the Community Atmosphere\u2013Biosphere\u2013Land Exchange model. We then predicted the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:KEmvaKc6tCQC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17760858306938640375", "cites_id": ["17760858306938640375"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12535", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:95cfc4c-e_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
