School of GeoSciences", "abstract": "A complex simulation model, MAESTRO, has been developed and validated against field measurements in plantation in both Scotland and Australia. It has been shown that MAESTRO can reasonably predict the daily course of PAR (photosynetically active radiation) transmittance at points below the canopies of radiata pine and Sitka spruce plantations.  1. Four structural properties of the Sitka spruce tree crown have been identified and evaluation in relation to PAR absorption, photosynthesis and transpiration. They are : the total amount leaves within the tree crown, leaf inclination angle distribution and crown shape. The total area of leaves and their spatial distribution within the tree crown are ranked as the two most significant properties.  2. Among the four different structural properties studied, crown shape is least important for PAR absorption, photosynthesis and transpiration. For the Sitka spruce stand studied, transpiration was most sensitive to the total area of leaves within the tree crown, whereas photosynthesis can be significantly affected by the leaf angle distribution. The influence of crown structure also depends on the beam fraction, radiance of diffuse radiation, incident angle of beam radiation.  3. Application of MAESTRO has shown the importance of the spatial distribution of leaf area density distribution and the age structure of the leaf population within a dense Sitka spruce canopy for the radiation regime and for photosynthesis. It has been found that the non-uniform canopy structure. The actual leaf age structure within a dense Sitka spruce canopy has been compared with the leaf age structure that is optimal for maximising the PAR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4786815332693193832", "cites_id": ["4786815332693193832"], "pub_url": "https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/282", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aDSS9i4vbkIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 4, "1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
