However, the dominant regions controlling inter\u2010annual to multi\u2010decadal variability of global NBP are still controversial (semi\u2010arid regions vs. temperate or tropical forests). By developing a theory for partitioning the variance of NBP into the contributions of net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) at different timescales, and using both observation\u2010based atmospheric CO2 inversion product and the outputs of 10 process\u2010based terrestrial ecosystem models forced by 110\u2010year observational climate, we tried to reconcile the controversy by showing that semi\u2010arid lands dominate the variability of global NBP at inter\u2010annual (<10 years) and tropical forests dominate at multi\u2010decadal scales (>30 years). Results further indicate that global NBP variability is dominated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:PGOTqER0XmoC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8805752592013326724", "cites_id": ["8805752592013326724"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14275", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hPnt2lNRNHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
