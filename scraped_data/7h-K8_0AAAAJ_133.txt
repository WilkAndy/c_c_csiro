Errors in model parameter values are a major cause of those large modelling errors but can be significantly reduced if model parameter values are optimized. While parameter optimizations have been carried out at local sites or regional scales, parameter optimizations have been rarely conducted at the global scale because of the high computing costs required to optimize a large (>100) number of model parameters. In this study, we used an adaptive surrogate modelling based optimization (ASMO) method to maximize the match between simulated monthly global gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) derived \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:uwB3iyG56gEC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6963791786597460715", "cites_id": ["6963791786597460715"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.5428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:66rs8btbpGAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
