The growing imbalance of anthropogenic N and P inputs into the future is estimated to exacerbate P limitation on land and limit the land carbon (C) sink, so that we hypothesized that P limitation will increasingly reduce C sequestered per unit N deposited into the future. Using a global land surface model (CABLE), we simulated the effects of increased N deposition with and without P limitation on land C uptake and the fate of deposited N on land from 1901 to 2100. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that N deposition continued to induce land C sequestration into the future, contributing to 15% of future C sequestration as opposed to 6% over the historical period. P limitation reduced the future land C uptake per unit N deposited only moderately at the global scale but P limitation increasingly caused \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:5Hj2J4YjVXQC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9995425618244696857", "cites_id": ["9995425618244696857"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GB005952", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GXtQSqTitooJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 1}}
