This parameter has different variants in the literature, including a commonly used turnover time. However, we know little about how different transit time and turnover time are in representing carbon cycling through multiple compartments under a non-steady state. In this study, we estimate both C turnover time as defined by the conventional stock over flux and mean C transit time as defined by the mean age of C mass leaving the system. We incorporate them into the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model to estimate C turnover time and transit time in response to climate warming and rising atmospheric [CO2]. Modelling analysis shows that both C turnover time and transit time increase with climate warming but decrease with rising atmospheric [CO2]. Warming increases C turnover time by 2.4 years and transit time by 11.8 years in 2100 relative to that at steady state in 1901. During the same period, rising atmospheric [CO2] decreases C turnover time by 3.8 years and transit time by 5.5 years. Our analysis shows that 65\u2009% of the increase in global mean C transit time with climate warming results from the depletion of fast-turnover C pool. The remaining 35\u2009% increase results from accompanied changes in compartment C age structures. Similarly, the decrease in mean C transit time with rising atmospheric [CO2] results approximately equally from replenishment of C into fast-turnover C pool and subsequent decrease in compartment C age structure. Greatly different from the transit time, the turnover time, which does \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:rI7N8NGxj9wC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13523537489600085509", "cites_id": ["13523537489600085509"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2018-175/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BX5KLrJBrbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
