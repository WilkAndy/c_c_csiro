The interactions between carbon (C) and the nutrient cycles, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are important to the biosphere\u2019s storage of carbon. The century-scale carbon-climate feedback of the land is projected to be an order of magnitude greater than the ocean; however, the land\u2019s importance may have been overestimated as they are based on models that neglect nutrient limitation. The omission of N limitation reduces the negative carbon-climate feedback by up to 30%, and further, we postulate as N-deposition and N-fixation increase, P limitation will become important in limiting the future land carbon-climate feedback. Process-based C, N and P land models are needed to realistically project this century carbon-climate feedback.
