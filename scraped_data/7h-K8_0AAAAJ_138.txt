Multiple soil temperature\u2010respiration functions and soil moisture\u2010respiration functions are incorporated into the Carnegie\u2010Ames\u2010Stanford Approach with Carbon\u2010Nitrogen\u2010Phosphorus (CASA\u2010CNP) biogeochemical model coupled to the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange land surface model. Every possible combination of the newly implemented functions is then used to simulate heterotrophic respiration and net ecosystem exchange at 10 different flux towers covering a large range of global vegetation types. Results show that a large uncertainty in the simulated net ecosystem exchange is attributable to differences in the soil respiration parameterization.
