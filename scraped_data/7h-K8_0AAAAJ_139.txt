Arid and semi-arid regions in Northern China are a major contributor to global dust emissions. However, how dust emissions affect soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient losses in this region are poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of SOC and nutrient (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) losses in spring using a process-based dust emission model in Northern China during 1982\u20132011. Spatial patterns of SOC and nutrient losses are consistent with dust emission rates across the research region. Annual losses of SOC, TN, and TP resulted from wind erosion in spring were 0.985\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.149\u202fTg\u202fyr\u22121, 0.094\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.014\u202fTg\u202fyr\u22121, and 0.089\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.013\u202fTg\u202fyr\u22121, respectively. Two distinct periods with opposite trends were identified in dust \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:rqo51bwTRb4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4697335028227726092", "cites_id": ["4697335028227726092"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231019304340", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DFuDFFJJMEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
