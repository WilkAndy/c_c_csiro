However, the biogeographical patterns of NPP allocation are not well understood. We constructed a global database of forest NPP to investigate the observed spatial patterns of forest NPP allocation, as influenced by environmental drivers and forest stand age. We then examined whether dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) could capture these allocation patterns. The NPP allocation response to variations in temperature or precipitation was often opposite in leaves and fine roots, a finding consistent with the functional balance theory for allocation. The observed allocation to fine roots decreased with increasing temperature and precipitation. The observed allocation to wood and leaves decreased with forest stand age. The simulated allocation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:vQNBHXYRXdUC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11917928345095022237", "cites_id": ["11917928345095022237"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JG004777", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nabym6_8ZKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
