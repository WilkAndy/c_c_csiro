Using the Australian community land surface model (Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange), we performed factorial experiments to quantify the importance of external drivers (climate drivers and atmospheric CO2) and their interactions on annual terrestrial carbon uptake (FL), excluding land use change and fires, from 1959 to 2013. Our model simulations show a trend of 0.025\u2009\u00b1\u20090.015\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009yr\u22122 (or ~1.5%\u2009yr\u22121) in global FL for 1959\u20132013, which is largely attributed to the positive influences of the increased atmospheric CO2 (0.050\u2009\u00b1\u20090.001\u2009Pg\u2009C\u2009yr\u22122) and negative influences of changes in climate (\u22120.026\u2009\u00b1\u20090.014 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:yyP9NS4UN-AC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=672042646060969447", "cites_id": ["672042646060969447"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067162", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:561g2DmTUwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
