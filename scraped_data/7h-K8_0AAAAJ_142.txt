Carr) tree crown. It is concluded that inaccurate separation of beam and diffuse radiation leads to significant errors in estimating the amounts of PAR absorbed, photosynthesis and transpiration by a tree in the stand. Much more attention should be paid to adequate descriptions of the radiance distribution of the sky diffuse radiation under different sky conditions. A useful approach is proposed for simulating the incident global radiaiton in a physiological, process-based model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9646855420490054299", "cites_id": ["9646855420490054299"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22360704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m3rcyeSD4IUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2}}
