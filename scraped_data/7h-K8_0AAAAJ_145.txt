It remains unclear whether annual and seasonal warming (winter or summer) affect permafrost thaw and ecosystem C balance differently. It is also required to compare the short\u2010term stepwise warming and long\u2010term gradual warming effects. This study validated a land surface model, the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model, at an Alaskan tundra site, and then used it to simulate permafrost thaw and ecosystem C flux under annual warming, winter warming, and summer warming. The simulations were conducted under stepwise air warming (2\u00b0C\u2009yr\u22121) during 2007\u20132011, and gradual air warming (0.04\u00b0C\u2009yr\u22121) during 2007\u20132056. We hypothesized that all warming treatments induced greater permafrost thaw, and larger ecosystem respiration than plant growth thus shifting the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:f8EKI0lD6ZEC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13881255694767443786", "cites_id": ["13881255694767443786"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013JG002569", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Sk_7IoIgpMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 2}}
