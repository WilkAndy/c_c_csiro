Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) affects radiative forcing, but it also directly affects vegetation by increasing its water use efficiency (WUE). The potential contribution made by the physiological response of vegetation to the anomalously warm conditions over the basin is assessed using a coupled atmosphere\u2010land surface model. CO2 concentrations near the leaf surface are increased from preindustrial to present day and near\u2010future levels, without changes to the radiative forcing. Results showed that the increased WUE due to higher CO2 levels led to changes in the maximum surface air temperature and latent heat flux over the basin. The mean increase in maximum surface temperature over the whole MDB in May\u2013October 2002 was not statistically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15135660698497686838", "cites_id": ["15135660698497686838"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009JD012767", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Np3LjjarDNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
