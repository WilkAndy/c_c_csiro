However, the correlation between vegetation growth, temperature and seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO 2 concentration have become elusive with the slowed increasing trend of vegetation growth and weakened temperature control on CO 2 uptake since late 1990s. Here, based on in situ atmospheric CO 2 concentration records from the Barrow observatory site, we found a slowdown in the increasing trend of the atmospheric CO 2 amplitude from 1990s to mid-2000s. This phenomenon was associated with the paused decrease in the minimum CO 2 concentration ([CO 2] min), which was significantly correlated with the slowdown of vegetation greening and growing-season length extension. We then showed that both the vegetation greenness \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:CS3DEtbQARgC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1162412896874746101", "cites_id": ["1162412896874746101"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aae9ad/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9VCN-F64IRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
