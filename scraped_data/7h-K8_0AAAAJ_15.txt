To better understand and constrain this variability amongst models, we conducted an intercomparison of 11 ecosystem models applied to data from two forest free\u2010air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments at Duke University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We analysed model structures to identify the key underlying assumptions causing differences in model predictions of transpiration and canopy water use efficiency. We then compared the models against data to identify model assumptions that are incorrect or are large sources of uncertainty. We found that model\u2010to\u2010model and model\u2010to\u2010observations differences resulted from four key sets of assumptions, namely (i) the nature of the stomatal response to elevated CO2 (coupling between photosynthesis and stomata \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 328, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17019808452580202152", "cites_id": ["17019808452580202152"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qNY74ZyBMuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 31, "2015": 36, "2016": 44, "2017": 39, "2018": 32, "2019": 42, "2020": 26, "2021": 32, "2022": 25, "2023": 9}}
