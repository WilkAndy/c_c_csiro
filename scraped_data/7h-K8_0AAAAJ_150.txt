Still, a large divergence of global SR estimates and its autotrophic (AR) and heterotrophic (HR) components exists among process based terrestrial ecosystem models. Therefore, alternatively derived global benchmark values are warranted for constraining the various ecosystem model output. In this study, we developed models based on the global soil respiration database (version 5.0), using the random forest (RF) method to generate the global benchmark distribution of total SR and its components. Benchmark values were then compared with the output of ten different global terrestrial ecosystem models. Our observationally derived global mean annual benchmark rates were 85.5\u00b140.4 (SD) Pg C yr\u2212 1 for SR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:A-tbffQ4IL8C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5139488649323413270", "cites_id": ["5139488649323413270"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abf526/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fv8SRrIhU0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
