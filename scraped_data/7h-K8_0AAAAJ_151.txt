By conducting a meta-analysis of 1928 observations from 158 independent experimental studies, we quantified the direction and magnitude of different interactions (i.e., additive, synergistic, and antagonistic) between N and P additions on eight variables related to belowground C pools and fluxes. The results showed that the interactions were antagonistic for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and were additive for soil organic carbon (SOC), fungal biomass, and soil respiration (Rs). Synergistic interactions occurred less frequently than additive or antagonistic interactions, and were observed for bacterial and total microbial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:czbaHzMgHzMC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2154174525175327623", "cites_id": ["2154174525175327623"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071721000882", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h2tFPVEq5R0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
