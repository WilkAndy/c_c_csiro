Nevertheless, previous researches mainly focused on the direct effect of wind erosion through removing surface soil only but ignored its indirect effects associated with soil nitrogen (N) loss and subsequent reductions of plant productivity. To better understand the wind erosion effect on SOC storage, we conducted a large\u2010scale field experiment by manipulating wind erosion at 371 sites in arid and semiarid regions of northwest China from 2014 to 2016. We further integrated an observation\u2010based empirical equation of wind erosion process into a terrestrial biogeochemical model to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of wind erosion on SOC storage in northwest China. The observed results showed that direct SOC losses increased linearly with the square of wind speed but decreased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ms1Q_PLG2XUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3088123621723037833", "cites_id": ["3088123621723037833"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JG004804", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iWBLhxI42yoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
