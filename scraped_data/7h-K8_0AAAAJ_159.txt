Therefore, vertically resolved soil carbon models are needed for accurately predicting future soil carbon under global warming. In this study, we developed a vertically resolved soil carbon model by including vertical transport of soil carbon and using Michaelis\u2010Menten kinetics for soil carbon decomposition by microbes. The model was calibrated against six sites with the observed profiles of both soil carbon concentration and 14C measurements, and against 91 forest sites with soil carbon concentrations across a wide range of climate and soil conditions for four forest types in Europe and China. Results of independent model validation at another 93 sites showed that the calibrated model explained 40%\u201394% of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:vqiJ1fI9etEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8397741674496537372", "cites_id": ["8397741674496537372"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JG006205", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HDPcT4_FinQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
