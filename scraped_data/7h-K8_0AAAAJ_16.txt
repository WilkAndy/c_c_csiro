The models employ the same equations to described leaf gas exchange, but differ considerably in the level of detail employed to represent canopy structure and radiation environment. Daily rates of canopy photosynthesis simulated by the two models agree to within 10% across a range of CO2 concentrations and temperatures. A doubling of Ca leads to modest increases of simulated daily canopy photosynthesis at low temperatures (10% increase at 10\u00b0C), but larger increases at higher temperatures (60% increase at 30\u00b0C). The temperature and CO2 dependencies of canopy photosynthesis are interpreted in terms of simulated contributions by quantum\u2010saturated and non\u2010saturated foliage.
