This uncertainty is mainly due to nitrogen (N) availability not being included in model simulations. N availability is ultimately determined by the balance of N inputs and outputs for the terrestrial ecosystem. Here, as the largest N input pathway, the influence of biological N fixation (BNF) combined with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, climate change, and atmospheric N deposition on future terrestrial C sequestration is investigated to the year 2100 using the Community Atmosphere\u2013Biosphere\u2013Land Exchange (CABLE) global land surface model. Projections show a net land C accumulation increase of \u223c20% by 2100 for the terrestrial ecosystem, relative to the pre-industrial (1901\u20131910) level. BNF will increase terrestrial C sequestration by \u223c104\u202fPg\u202fC by the end of this century \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:zSM0IxRRLoQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16342650323366105559", "cites_id": ["16342650323366105559"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618324314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:19GozOHBzOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
