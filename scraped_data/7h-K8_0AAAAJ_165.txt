Multiple 30-year simulations are conducted for each of the seven methods and results are analyzed in terms of the mean climatology and the probability density functions (PDFs) of key variables based on daily data. Results show that the method used for canopy interception strongly affects how rainfall is partitioned between canopy evaporation and throughfall. However, the impact on total evaporation is much smaller, and the impact on rainfall and air temperature is negligible. Similarly, the PDFs of canopy evaporation and transpiration for six selected regions are strongly affected by the method used for canopy interception, but the impact on total evaporation, temperature and precipitation is negligible. Our results show that the parameterization of rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14680014717599495064", "cites_id": ["14680014717599495064"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-010-0862-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mDMGjJvjucsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
