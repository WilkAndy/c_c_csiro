Process-based models of soil C are useful tools to simulate C dynamics, but it is important to bridge any disconnect that exists between the data used to inform the models and the processes that they depict. To minimise that disconnect, we developed a consistent modelling framework that integrates new spatially explicit soil measurements and data with the Rothamsted carbon model (Roth C) and simulates the response of soil organic C to future climate change across Australia. We compiled publicly available continental-scale datasets and pre-processed, standardised and configured them to the required spatial and temporal resolutions. We then calibrated Roth C and ran simulations to estimate the baseline soil organic C stocks and composition in the 0\u20130.3\u2009m layer at 4043 sites in cropping, modified grazing, native grazing and natural environments across Australia. We used data on the C fractions, the particulate, mineral-associated and resistant organic C (POC, MAOC and ROC, respectively) to represent the three main C pools in the Roth C model's structure. The model explained 97\u2009%\u201398\u2009% of the variation in measured total organic C in soils under cropping and grazing and 65\u2009% in soils under natural environments. We optimised the model at each site and experimented with different amounts of C inputs to simulate the potential for C accumulation under constant climate in a 100-year simulation. With an annual increase of 1\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u22121 in C inputs, the model simulated a potential soil C increase of 13.58 (interquartile range 12.19 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:UsE54j44yzgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10377414500818674000,139570221572725776", "cites_id": ["10377414500818674000", "139570221572725776"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/5185/2021/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UOFIsIH7A5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
