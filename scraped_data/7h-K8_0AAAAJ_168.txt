However, the global climate-amplifying effect from this feedback loop (determined by the gain factor, g) has not been quantified from observations. Here we apply a Fourier analysis-based carbon cycle feedback framework to the reconstructed records from 1850 to 2017 and 1000 to 1850 to estimate \u03b2 and \u03b3. We show that the \u03b2-feedback varies by less than 10% with an average of 3.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.32\u2009GtC\u2009ppm\u22121 for 1880\u20132017, whereas the \u03b3-feedback increases from \u221233\u2009\u00b1\u200914\u2009GtC\u2009K\u22121 on a decadal scale to \u2212122\u2009\u00b1\u200960\u2009GtC\u2009K\u22121 on a centennial scale for 1000\u20131850. Feedback analysis further reveals that the current amplification effect from the carbon cycle feedback is small (g is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:q-3Epam53P4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7991431472822538079", "cites_id": ["7991431472822538079"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22392-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X892iJVE524J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
