Here we investigate how features of the CABLE model impact on present-day surface climate using ACCESS atmosphere-only simulations. The main differences attributed to CABLE include a warmer winter and a cooler summer in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), earlier NH spring runoff from snowmelt, and smaller seasonal and diurnal temperature ranges. The cooler NH summer temperatures in canopy-covered regions are more consistent with observations and are attributed to two factors. Firstly, CABLE accounts for aerodynamic and radiative interactions between the canopy and the ground below; this placement of the canopy above the ground eliminates the need for a separate bare ground tile in canopy-covered areas. Secondly, CABLE simulates larger evapotranspiration fluxes and a slightly larger daytime cloud cover fraction. Warmer NH winter temperatures result from the parameterization of cold climate processes in CABLE in snow-covered areas. In particular, prognostic snow density increases through the winter and lowers the diurnally resolved snow albedo; variable snow thermal conductivity prevents early winter heat loss but allows more heat to enter the ground as the snow season progresses; liquid precipitation freezing within the snowpack delays the building of the snowpack in autumn and accelerates snow melting in spring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:C75MlVM-XVcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8363904244343183412", "cites_id": ["8363904244343183412"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2771/2016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NBh1q5iOEnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
