Here we isolate the fingerprint of increasing LAI on surface air temperature using a coupled land\u2013atmosphere global climate model prescribed with satellite LAI observations. We find that the global greening has slowed down the rise in global land-surface air temperature by 0.09 \u00b1 0.02\u2009\u00b0C since 1982. This net cooling effect is the sum of cooling from increased evapotranspiration (70%), changed atmospheric circulation (44%), decreased shortwave transmissivity (21%), and warming from increased longwave air emissivity (\u221229%) and decreased albedo (\u22126%). The global cooling originated from the regions where LAI has increased, including boreal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:TaF7eNGHiZkC", "num_citations": 297, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1580724462729271160", "cites_id": ["1580724462729271160"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eJe_GIbc7xUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 8, "2018": 32, "2019": 31, "2020": 49, "2021": 54, "2022": 83, "2023": 39}}
