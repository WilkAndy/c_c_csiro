Coupled land-atmosphere simulations are then performed using CABLE within the Australian Community Climate and Earth Systems Simulator (ACCESS) with pre-5 scribed sea surface temperatures. As in most land surface models, the default stomatal conductance scheme only accounts for differences in model parameters in relation to the photosynthetic pathway, but not in relation to plant functional types. The new scheme allows model parameters to vary by plant functional type, based on a global synthesis of observations of stomatal conductance under different climate regimes over 10 a wide range of species. We show that the new scheme reduces the latent heat flux from the land surface over the boreal forests during the Northern Hemisphere summer by 0.5 to 1.0 mmday\u2212 1. This leads to warmer daily maximum and minimum temperatures by up to 1.0\u25e6 C and warmer extreme maximum temperatures by up to 1.5\u25e6 C. These changes generally improve the climate model\u2019s climatology and improve existing 15 biases by 10\u201320%. The change in the surface energy balance also affects net primary productivity and the terrestrial carbon balance. We conclude that the improvements in the global climate model which result from the new stomatal scheme, constrained by a global synthesis of experimental data, provide a valuable advance in the long-term development of the ACCESS modelling system. 20"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:uoIO7Ko97q4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17358301388303079785", "cites_id": ["17358301388303079785"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/8/5235/2015/gmdd-8-5235-2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aZn5-SQT5fAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
