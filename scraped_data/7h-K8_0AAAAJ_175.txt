Results from 12 models simulating six elevated CO2 experiments using the protocols, met data, and other data supplied in the accompanying dataset: Phase 2 Free Air CO2 Enrichment Model-Data Synthesis: Meteorological Data and Protocols. File naming convention can be found in the file 'facemds-file-table-modeldata.xml' and information about variable naming convention can be found in the file 'facemds-standard-name-table-modvars.xml'. We followed the ALMA v3 convention for meteorological variables and developed a hierarchical naming scheme for ecosystem variables. Additional info can be found in the protocols in the accompanying meteorological dataset (doi:10.15485/1480328). We replaced the original naming convention mentioned in the protocol with the one described in 'facemds-standard-name-table-modvars.xml'."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:trmuqZugEg0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1333290697186048663", "cites_id": ["1333290697186048663"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1480327", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l3obNNPMgBIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
