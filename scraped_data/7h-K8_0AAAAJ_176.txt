The main CSIRO GCM in 1990 had a single soil type, constant roughness length over land and no vegetation. It used the soil-moisture scheme of Deardorff (1977) and the forcing method of Deardorff (1978) to calculate land surface temperature. In 1991 a simple stand alone model of soil-canopy based on a big leaf description of a canopy and a force restore model for soil was described by Kowalczyk et al.(1991). The model was implemented into the CSIRO GCM in 1993 (see Kowalczyk et al. 1994). The latter scheme included a number of additional features such as soil type (hence variable thermal and moisture properties for different soil types), albedo, roughness length, canopy resistance, canopy interception of rainfall, runoff, deep soil percolation, snow accumulation and melting. The canopy was represented by a single big leaf model. The canopy temperature was calculated by solving surface energy balance equations and stomatal resistance was calculated as a function of incoming radiation, saturation water vapour pressure deficit and temperature of the ambient air in the surface layer and soil water content.In 1995 an improved version of the soil-snow model was implemented into the GCM and the CSIRO regional model, Division of Atmospheric Research Limited Area Model (DARLAM). Improvement upon the previous land surface model included a multilayer soil model computing temperature, liquid water and ice content of soil, and a new snow model calculating \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:NpQWRVIN-bwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7407254521276496888", "cites_id": ["7407254521276496888"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5544676723bf9836b37307f8ad049fa8e1fb8740#page=91", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-HuX5b3ay2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
