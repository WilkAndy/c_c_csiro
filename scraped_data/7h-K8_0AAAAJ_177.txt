One of the key priorities is to build a model able to perform IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) experiments. The strategy for ACCESS in terms of land-biosphere modelling for the AR5 is to couple the CSIRO Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE), CASA-CNP and LPJ DGVM models. The coupled system has to be calibrated against available observations and stable under present climate conditions when coupled to ACCESS atmospheric model by mid 2009.CABLE is a model of biosphere-atmosphere exchange which includes the aerodynamic and radiative interaction of a canopy with the bare ground below and atmosphere above and the treatment of turbulence inside the canopy. CABLE is a one layer two-leaf canopy model as described in Wang and Leuning (1998) and it was formulated on the basis of a multilayer model of Leuning et al.(1995). CABLE was coupled to the CSIRO global circulation model but it is available to be used as an offline model by the Australian research community."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14936743340656027074", "cites_id": ["14936743340656027074"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/53885093/Modelling_to_assess_water_resources_avai20170717-13329-189ps3k.pdf#page=51", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wuX7GO74Sc8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
