Canberra, Australia", "pages": "33-37", "abstract": "At the core of most models of plant production there is a calculation of photosynthate production. In general, the major driving factor in this calculation is the radiation intercepted by the plant. This review summarises the alternative methods used to calculate conversion of intercepted radiation into photosynthate.It should be noted that in Australian conditions the most limiting resource to photosynthesis is often not light but water availability. In some models, water availability is treated as one of a number of factors modifying the rate of radiation conversion, but in other models the water limitation is implemented in a \u2018minimum limiting factor\u2019approach, implying that radiation interception becomes irrelevant for production if water availability is low. These alternative approaches will be discussed briefly."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:18U4RWrXZp4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13254802685382659005", "cites_id": ["13254802685382659005"], "pub_url": "http://kirschbaum.id.au/NEE_Workshop_Proceedings.pdf#page=36", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vYsgvtCE8rcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
