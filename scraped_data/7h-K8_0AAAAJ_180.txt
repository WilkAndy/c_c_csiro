Most experimental studies are small in spatial scale (individual plants, microcosms, mesocosms) and short in time span (days to years). For example, the largest experimental carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) studies cover less than 1 ha and have been 10 years or less in duration (Hendrey et al., 1999; Ainsworth & Long, 2005). Many science and policy questions that we need to answer, on the other hand, are typically phrased in terms of responses of biomes over several decades: for example, how will crop and forest production be affected in the next 50 years? Will the terrestrial biosphere continue to act as a net carbon sink over the next century? Models are necessary to bridge this gap between experimental and policy time and space scales (eg Prentice et al., 2001; Medlyn & McMurtrie, 2005)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7122335167521173945", "cites_id": ["7122335167521173945"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FzT2GUVUktIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA165&dq=info:uTFfXxme12IJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9xV3vtbxoA&sig=X787dGCZIP0sMKn1SGe2gUN2wgs", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uTFfXxme12IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
