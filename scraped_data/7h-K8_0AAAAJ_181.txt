Understanding the partitioning of rN losses into different environmental compartments is critical to mitigate negative impacts, however, loss pathways are poorly quantified, and potential changes driven by climate warming and societal shifts are highly uncertain. We present a coupled soil-atmosphere isotope model (IsoTONE; ISOtopic Tracing Of Nitrogen in the Environment) to partition rN losses into leaching, harvest, NH3 volatilization, and production of NO, N2 and N2O based on a global dataset of soil \u03b415N, as well as numerous other geoclimatic and experimental datasets. The model was optimized in a Bayesian framework using a time series of N2O mixing ratios and isotopic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:gTm0F0ptQfkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..23..804H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
