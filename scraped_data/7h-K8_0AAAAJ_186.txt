Land surface models used tostudy the C cycle rarely considered \ufb02exibility in the decomposer C use e\ufb03ciency (CUEd) de\ufb01ned by the fraction of decomposed litter-C that is retained as SOM (as opposed to be respired). In this study, we adapted a conceptual formulation ofCUEd based on assumption that litter decomposers optimally adjust their CUEd as afunction of litter substrate C to nitrogen (N) stoichiometry to maximize their growthrates. This formulation was incorporated into an empirical soil biogeochemicalmodel (CENTURY) and a microbial explicit model (the MIcrobial-MIneral CarbonStabilization (MIMICS) model). Then the two models with new CUE formulationwere evaluated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:tL4NlYW7KOUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140489578&h=guNXI0o7eFrPPMFRwVqVe4hV%2Bh4%2Fk%2B6LDeWFyYQB4VQH4cNVrCq3rTo6gGxElsbSLslyLXj1CS82maXGe1sspA%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
