The uncertainty could be further propagated into projected further climate change. It is very urgent to quantify the contribution of model structure differences to the uncertainty. In this purpose, a framework was recently introduced (Luo et al., in preparation)(Figure 1). The framework decomposes the transient dynamics of terrestrial carbon storage into several traceable components. We apply this framework on Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model (Wang et al., 2010). To quantify the contribution of model structures in response to elevating CO2 and climate change, we designed three global change scenarios for two versions of CABLE: carbon-only (C-only) and coupled carbon-nitrogen (CN). Three scenarios include climate change and elevating CO2 scenario (SCEC for C-only; SCECN for CN), climate change only scenario (SCC for C-only; SCCN for CN), and elevating CO2 only scenario (SEC for C-only; SECN for CN). The changes of global terrestrial carbon storage from different scenarios are clearly segregated by three traceable components (Figure 2): global Net Primary Productivity (NPP), global ecosystem residence time, and global carbon storage potential. Effects of elevating CO2, climate change and soil nitrogen limitation on change of terrestrial carbon storage can be shown through the changes of traceable components: a) Increase of NPP in SEC, SECN, SCEC and SCECN explain most increase of terrestrial carbon storage. It indicates elevating atmosphere CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:VcGLcUShYXsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6405346456841855955&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:06NdX6pc5FgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
