The more processes incorporated, the more difficult it becomes to understand or evaluate model behavior. As a result, uncertainty in predictions among global land models cannot be easily diagnosed and attributed to their sources. We have recently developed an approach to analytically decompose a complex land model into traceable components based on mutually independent properties of modeled core biogeochemical processes. As all global land carbon models share those common properties, this traceability framework is applicable to all of them to improve their tractability. Indeed, we have applied the traceability framework to improve model diagnostics in several aspects. First, we have applied the framework to the Australian Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model and Community \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:8m4wTQn51gQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.7635L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
