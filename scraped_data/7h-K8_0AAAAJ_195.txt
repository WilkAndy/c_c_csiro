Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments lasting a decade or more have investigated ecosystem responses to a step change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. To interpret FACE results in the context of gradual increases in atmospheric CO2 over decades to centuries, we used a suite of seven models to simulate the Duke and Oak Ridge FACE experiments extended for 300 years of CO2"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ItgTnG0mAXQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16264908986663672422&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZpolVoyQuOEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
