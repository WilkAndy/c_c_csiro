They usually simulate exchanges of energy, water and carbon between continents and the atmosphere. Major carbon (C) fluxes, such as primary production, plant and soil respiration, have been clearly identified and are assumed to have maintained storage of terrestrial carbon at the equilibrium under pre-industrial conditions. In spite of this the representation of soil heterotrophic respiration, the flux of CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere, is very uncertain in global models that smooth landscapes in several degrees of resolution grid cells. Similarly, the complexity of the interactions between the global C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles is often omitted by not considering nutrients in the modelling system. Although these sources of uncertainty have been addressed separately in models of various complexity, it has never \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:fD5pJnbkXkUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.1352E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
