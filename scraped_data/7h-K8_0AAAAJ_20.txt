We contend that by revising the representation of microbial processes and their interactions with the physicochemical soil environment, Earth system models (ESMs) will make more realistic global C cycle projections. Explicit representation of microbial processes presents considerable challenges due to the scale at which these processes occur. Thus, applying microbial theory in ESMs requires a framework to link micro\u2010scale process\u2010level understanding and measurements to macro\u2010scale models used to make decadal\u2010 to century\u2010long projections. Here we review the diversity, advantages, and pitfalls of simulating soil biogeochemical cycles using microbial\u2010explicit modeling approaches. We present a roadmap for how to begin building, applying, and evaluating reliable microbial\u2010explicit model formulations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:jOyC0gq838wC", "num_citations": 279, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1834781911691872729", "cites_id": ["1834781911691872729"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GB005188", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2cm0dm10dhkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 14, "2017": 25, "2018": 35, "2019": 53, "2020": 36, "2021": 49, "2022": 46, "2023": 17}}
