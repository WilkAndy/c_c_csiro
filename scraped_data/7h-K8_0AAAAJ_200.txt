Gaseous losses of N via denitrification pathways have the potential to remove a significant fraction of fixed N from the biosphere, thus constraining global N supplies. Global-scale estimations of gaseous N losses remain uncertain, owing to difficulties in scaling local soil measures to regions coupled with the intractability of N 2 gas measurements. We use a novel stable nitrogen isotope model to estimate the global distribution of gaseous N losses from the unmanaged (ie, non-agrarian) terrestrial biosphere. In the model, terrestrial N isotope ratios are determined by the isotopic composition of N inputs and losses. The \u03b4 15 N of inputs is based on the mean \u03b4 15 N of deposition (-1.5\u2030) and fixation (0\u2030) and their relative contributions to total N inputs among regions. The isotope effect of leaching losses is approximately 0\u2030 based on data synthesis. The isotope effect of gaseous losses varies from 16\u2030 to 20\u2030, depending on local denitrification conditions. The fraction of N lost via gaseous pathways is modeled by formulating these processes into a simple analytical model. We then estimate the steady-state distribution of gaseous N fluxes from land using estimates of N 2 fixation (1 degree\u00d7 1 degree) generated from the CASA-CNP model, and N deposition (5 degree\u00d7 3.75 degree) from a three dimensional chemistry-transport model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eco.confex.com/eco/2009/techprogram/P17489.HTM", "cites_per_year": {}}
