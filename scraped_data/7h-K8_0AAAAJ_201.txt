It has been recognized for some time that N fixing organisms hold an advantage under N-poor/phosphorus (P)-rich conditions; and this line of reasoning reliably explains patterns of fixation in some sites, especially those associated with major disturbances and early in ecosystem succession. At the same time, symbiotic N-fixing plants (ie Fabaceae) are widely distributed across sites that appear high in N and low in P, but almost entirely absent from those that are low in N and high in P. It thus appears that a globally applicable framework of N fixation must be able to capture myriads of conditions, with mechanistic explanations for presence and absence, persistence and disappearance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:g4gGp8M7V98C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eco.confex.com/eco/2009/techprogram/P16409.HTM", "cites_per_year": {}}
