It was found that in-situ measurements of hourly CO 2 concentrations at Cape Grim could provide significant information about the carbon fluxes from Tasmania, central-south and south-east Australia only. The process-based model, CBM, overestimates the ecosystem respiration during summer in south-east Australia, but underestimates ecosystem respiration in Tasmania and central-south Australia. It was concluded that the respiration sub model of CBM should be improved to account for the seasonal variation in the plant and soil respiration parameters in south-east Australia. For the whole period of 1990 to 1998, the mean net ecosystem productions of terrestrial ecosystems in Tasmania, central-south Australia and south-east Australia were estimated to be, respectively, 6\u00b110, 7\u00b127 and 64\u00b118 Mt C/yr. The yearly uptake rate (being negative) of the terrestrial ecosystems in south-east Australia was smallest (42\u00b155 Mt C/yr) in 1998 and largest (91\u00b152 Mt C/yr) in 1992"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:OeO3PiPA3c0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:34041298", "cites_per_year": {}}
