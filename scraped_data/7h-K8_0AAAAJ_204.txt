The largest such emission source is from the eructation of ruminant livestock; other major sources include fugitive emissions from fuel production and waste disposal. A spatially explicit inventory of methane emissions was compiled for Australia. Predicted atmospheric concentrations were generated by feeding the inventory emissions into a limited area atmospheric computer model. Using the newly-emerging technique of synthesis inversion, these predictions were compared against observed methane concentrations measured at Cape Grim (Tasmania), to see whether the emissions inventory was consistent with the atmospheric concentration measurements. The inversion indicated that the inventory may overestimate true emissions by around 30% to 40% in central southern and south-eastern Australia. The inversion technique applies generally to non-reactive pollutants, and is an exciting new technique that can be used at smaller regional and urban scales to verify emissions inventories using real-world data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:jmj0Wi0nzAgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/bentley_2002a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Gz54e7PLFsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
