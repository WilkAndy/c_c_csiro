We take the indexes for N as an example, but the computation of corresponding indexes for P are similar.Assume NPP is allocated to leaf, wood and roots by 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2, those pools with C: N ratios of 25, 150 and 50. In Cleveland's index, N is allocated in fractions of 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2 in NPP-N (Cj can be moved before CtoNj in their Eq. S7). The new NPP is (0.5* 25+ 0.3* 150+ 0.2* 50)* IN= 67.5 IN, where IN represent external nutrients inputs, ie the sum of deposition and biological fixation for N which is available to vegetation. They assume that the remaining NPP must be totally fueled by resorption and net mineralization in the soil. They modelled the amount of N resorption but computed the amount of mineralization as the difference between nutrient demand, new nutrient inputs, and nutrient resorption (their Eqs. S5). So the \u201cproportion of new NPP fueled by new nutrient inputs\u201d index in Cleveland et al.(2013) equals 67.5 IN/NPP."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:jNf07s93Da0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/item/item_2565924_2/component/file_3001459/BGC2827s1.zip?mode=download", "cites_per_year": {}}
