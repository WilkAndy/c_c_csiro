Primarily because of anthropogenic activities, the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have increased substantially over the last century. The current atmospheric concentration of CO2 exceeds 400 parts per million (ppm) and is growing at a rate of~ 2 ppm/yr (\u00b10.1 ppm/yr). Similarly, CH4 emissions have accelerated since 2007 and now exceed 1800 parts per billion (ppb), roughly 2.5 times increase over preindustrial levels. In fact CO2 concentrations would be even higher if it were not for large compensating uptake by the terrestrial biosphere and oceans, offsetting more than 50% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions to date. Increasing CO2 concentrations and surface temperature have direct carbon cycle feedback effects on the biospheric and oceanic uptake of CO2; however, the magnitude and range of these feedbacks remain uncertain. Uncertainties in these carbon cycle feedbacks increase the physical uncertainty in climate projections by roughly 50% for any given emissions target, contributing significantly to uncertainty about future climate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:RTnHyEp0C-wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cce.nasa.gov/cce/pdfs/final_carbon_climate.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cJzKz8FnpNwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
