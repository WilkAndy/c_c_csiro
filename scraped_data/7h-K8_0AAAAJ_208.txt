Here we investigate how features of the CABLE model impact on present day surface climate using ACCESS atmosphere-only simulations. The main differences attributed to CABLE include a warmer winter and a cooler summer in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), earlier NH spring runoff from snowmelt, and 5 smaller seasonal and diurnal temperature ranges. Cooler NH summer temperatures in canopy covered areas are attributed to two factors. Firstly CABLE accounts for aerodynamic and radiative interactions between the canopy and the ground below; this placement of canopy above the ground eliminates the need for a separate bare ground tile in canopy covered areas. Secondly, CABLE produces larger evapotranspiration fluxes and slightly larger daytime cloud cover fraction. Warmer NH winter temperatures result from the parameterization of cold climate processes in CABLE in snow covered areas. In particular prognostic 10 snow density increases through the winter and lowers diurnally resolved snow albedo; variable snow thermal conductivity prevents early winter heat loss but allows more heat to enter the ground as the snow season progresses; liquid precipitation freezing within the snowpack delays the building of the snow pack in autumn and accelerates snow melting in spring."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:tltQ_bo2KloC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9103/bb9596d5a60134b8b93a54b1364733f1c919.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HlyYW9DwwLMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
