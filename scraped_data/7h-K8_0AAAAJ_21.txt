Data from ecosystem-scale Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments provide a unique opportunity to reduce this uncertainty. The recent FACE Model\u2013Data Synthesis project aimed to use the information gathered in two forest FACE experiments to assess and improve land ecosystem models. A new 'assumption-centred' model intercomparison approach was used, in which participating models were evaluated against experimental data based on the ways in which they represent key ecological processes. By identifying and evaluating the main assumptions causing differences among models, the assumption-centred approach produced a clear roadmap for reducing model uncertainty. Here, we explain this approach and summarize the resulting research agenda. We encourage the application of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:btULBOGQ_gcC", "num_citations": 277, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8800043907094281616", "cites_id": ["8800043907094281616"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2621", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kP0xEk8JIHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 21, "2017": 39, "2018": 38, "2019": 40, "2020": 47, "2021": 43, "2022": 29, "2023": 9}}
