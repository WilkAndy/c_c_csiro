Model predictions of eCO2 effects on vegetation carbon storage depend on how allocation and turnover processes are represented. We used data from two temperate forest free\u2010air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments to evaluate representations of allocation and turnover in 11 ecosystem models. Observed eCO2 effects on allocation were dynamic. Allocation schemes based on functional relationships among biomass fractions that vary with resource availability were best able to capture the general features of the observations. Allocation schemes based on constant fractions or resource limitations performed less well, with some models having unintended outcomes. Few models represent turnover processes mechanistically and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:8VbLR7ExW8oC", "num_citations": 241, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=305870355043875053", "cites_id": ["305870355043875053"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.12847", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7Xi2o3erPgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 21, "2016": 30, "2017": 31, "2018": 23, "2019": 32, "2020": 26, "2021": 30, "2022": 29, "2023": 13}}
