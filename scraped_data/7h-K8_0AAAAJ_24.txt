This evolution has been facilitated by advances in plant physiology and the availability of global fields of land surface parameters obtained from remote sensing. The CSIRO Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model presented here calculates carbon, water and heat exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere and is suitable for use in climate models and in the form of a one-dimensional stand-alone model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 237, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7069944748766470304", "cites_id": ["7069944748766470304"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gab-Abramowitz/publication/228543035_The_CSIRO_Atmosphere_Biosphere_Land_Exchange_CABLE_model_for_use_in_climate_models_and_as_an_offline_model/links/00b4952841c6475fc5000000/The-CSIRO-Atmosphere-Biosphere-Land-Exchange-CABLE-model-for-use-in-climate-models-and-as-an-offline-model.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oCDdc0p9HWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 12, "2011": 19, "2012": 9, "2013": 18, "2014": 21, "2015": 19, "2016": 17, "2017": 15, "2018": 22, "2019": 16, "2020": 13, "2021": 22, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
