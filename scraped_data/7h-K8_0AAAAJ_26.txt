The processes controlling EWUE are complex and reflect both a slow evolution of plants and plant communities as well as fast adjustments of ecosystem functioning to changes of limiting resources. In this study, we investigated EWUE trends from 1982 to 2008 using data\u2010driven models derived from satellite observations and process\u2010oriented carbon cycle models. Our findings suggest positive EWUE trends of 0.0056, 0.0007 and 0.0001 g C m\u22122 mm\u22121 yr\u22121 under the single effect of rising CO2 (\u2018CO2\u2019), climate change (\u2018CLIM\u2019) and nitrogen deposition (\u2018NDEP\u2019), respectively. Global patterns of EWUE trends under different scenarios suggest that (i) EWUE\u2010CO2 shows global increases, (ii) EWUE\u2010CLIM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:GbL5_m8SeH4C", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=548910969776059295", "cites_id": ["548910969776059295"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12873", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nzPRZp4fngcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 15, "2017": 20, "2018": 19, "2019": 30, "2020": 35, "2021": 27, "2022": 38, "2023": 20}}
