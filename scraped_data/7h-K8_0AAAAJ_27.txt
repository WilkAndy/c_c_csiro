However, the mechanisms determining impacts on the N cycle are not fully understood. To explore the mechanistic underpinnings of N impacts on N cycle processes, we reviewed and synthesised recent progress in ecosystem N research through empirical studies, conceptual analysis and model simulations. Experimental and observational studies have revealed that the stimulation of plant N uptake and soil retention generally diminishes as N loading increases, while dissolved and gaseous losses of N occur at low N availability but increase exponentially and become the dominant fate of N at high loading rates. The original N saturation hypothesis emphasises sequential N saturation from plant uptake to soil retention before N losses occur. However, biogeochemical models that simulate simultaneous competition for soil N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:6zSeHT1sY2IC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1291757801544830930", "cites_id": ["1291757801544830930"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12591", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0k_rYOA-7REJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 22, "2018": 29, "2019": 28, "2020": 35, "2021": 29, "2022": 34, "2023": 19}}
