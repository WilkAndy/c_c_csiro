Forests have traditionally been viewed as robust carbon (C) sinks; however, extreme heat-waves, drought and wildfire have increased tree mortality, particularly in widespread semi-arid regions, which account for\u223c 41% of Earth\u2019s land surface. Using a set of modeling experiments, we show that California grasslands are a more resilient C sink than forests in response to 21st century changes in climate, with implications for designing climate-smart Cap and Trade offset policies. The resilience of grasslands to rising temperatures, drought and fire, coupled with the preferential banking of C to belowground sinks, helps to preserve sequestered terrestrial C and prevent it from re-entering the atmosphere. In contrast, California forests appear unable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:G0G8x1Xwn_oC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13511857449875758131", "cites_id": ["13511857449875758131"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aacb39/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M1yPA8PCg7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 23, "2020": 46, "2021": 51, "2022": 48, "2023": 25}}
