Despite the broad recognition of the importance of mycorrhizae for global carbon and nutrient cycling, we do not know how soil and climate variables relate to the intensity of colonization of plant roots by mycorrhizal fungi. Here we quantify the global patterns of these relationships.Global.Data on plant root colonization intensities by the two dominant types of mycorrhizal fungi world\u2010wide, arbuscular (4887 plant species in 233 sites) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (125 plant species in 92 sites), were compiled from published studies. Data for climatic and soil factors were extracted from global datasets. For a given mycorrhizal type, we calculated at each site the mean root colonization intensity by mycorrhizal fungi across all potentially mycorrhizal plant species found at the site, and subjected these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:9ozBiMEOI0QC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1256827459122145449", "cites_id": ["1256827459122145449"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qajuROolcREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 23, "2017": 21, "2018": 34, "2019": 28, "2020": 30, "2021": 20, "2022": 25, "2023": 10}}
