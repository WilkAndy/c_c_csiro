Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warm the mid-latitudes more than the tropics, in part owing to a reduced snow\u2013albedo feedback as snow cover decreases. Higher concentration of carbon dioxide also increases precipitation in many regions, as a result of an intensification of the hydrological cycle. The biophysical effects of LULCC since pre-industrial times have probably cooled temperate and boreal regions and warmed some tropical regions. Here we use a climate model to show that how snow and rainfall change under increased greenhouse gases dominates how LULCC affects regional temperature. Increased greenhouse-gas-driven changes in snow and rainfall affect the snow\u2013albedo feedback and the supply of water, which in turn \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17446926539297132877", "cites_id": ["17446926539297132877"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1294", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TREk7T_vH_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 9, "2014": 12, "2015": 28, "2016": 10, "2017": 22, "2018": 19, "2019": 13, "2020": 17, "2021": 14, "2022": 21, "2023": 9}}
