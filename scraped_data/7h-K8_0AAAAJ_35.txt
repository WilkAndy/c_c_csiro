In this paper, we review the history of applications of various model\u2013data fusion techniques in studies of terrestrial carbon fluxes in two approaches: top-down approaches that use measurements of global CO2 concentration and sometimes other atmospheric constituents to infer carbon fluxes from the land surface, and bottom-up approaches that estimate carbon fluxes using process-based models. We consider applications of model\u2013data fusion in flux estimation, parameter estimation, model error analysis, experimental design and forecasting. Significant progress has been made by systematically studying the discrepancies between the predictions by different models and observations. As a result, some major controversies in global carbon cycle studies have been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14272768266442897445", "cites_id": ["14272768266442897445"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192309001749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JfjLMh4PE8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 22, "2012": 21, "2013": 13, "2014": 16, "2015": 15, "2016": 11, "2017": 16, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
