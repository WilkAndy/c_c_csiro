Soil phosphorus impoverishment in parts of the Amazon basin largely controls its functioning, but the role of phosphorus availability has not been considered in global model ensembles\u2014for example, during the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project. Here we simulate the planned free-air CO2 enrichment experiment AmazonFACE with an ensemble of 14 terrestrial ecosystem models. We show that phosphorus availability reduces the projected CO2-induced biomass carbon growth by about 50% to 79\u2009\u00b1\u200963\u2009g\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009yr\u22121 over 15 years compared to estimates from carbon and carbon\u2013nitrogen models. Our results suggest that the resilience of the region to climate change may be much less than previously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:TjyTfcaXIY8C", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14267824460049180285", "cites_id": ["14267824460049180285"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0404-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fWbcksB-AcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 35, "2021": 63, "2022": 44, "2023": 20}}
