A major impediment to including N limitation in model predictions has been the lack of constraint to rates of N fixation worldwide. Here we use a theoretical framework that considers interactions of C and nutrients to estimate rates of terrestrial N fixation, and thereby examining how the constraints of N on land C uptake and global warming. We show that most global models without nutrient limitations significantly overestimated land C uptake, thus underestimating both the pace and magnitude of the predicted global warming. We suggest that the next IPCC assessment should consider nutrient constraints on carbon\u2010climate feedback \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 166, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10199107328399691261", "cites_id": ["10199107328399691261"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009GL041009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_c1Y9xOCio0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 5, "2011": 10, "2012": 12, "2013": 9, "2014": 9, "2015": 21, "2016": 15, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 18, "2020": 13, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
