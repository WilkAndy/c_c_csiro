However, the LSMs embedded in state-of-the-art climate models differ in how they represent fundamental aspects of the hydrological and carbon cycles, resulting in large inter-model differences and sometimes faulty predictions. These \"third-generation\" LSMs respect the close coupling of the carbon and water cycles through plants, but otherwise tend to be under-constrained, and have not taken full advantage of robust hydrological parameterizations that were independently developed in offline models. Benchmarking, combining multiple sources of atmospheric, biospheric and hydrological data, should be a required component of LSM development, but this field has been relatively poorly supported and intermittently pursued. Moreover, benchmarking alone is not sufficient to ensure that models improve. Increasing complexity may increase realism but decrease reliability and robustness, by increasing the number of poorly known model parameters. In contrast, simplifying the representation of complex processes by stochastic parameterization (the representation of unresolved processes by statistical distributions of values) has been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:T64LSalLz9oC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11721120164084705074", "cites_id": ["11721120164084705074"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/15/5987/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MufvJbDIqaIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 12, "2017": 17, "2018": 16, "2019": 19, "2020": 20, "2021": 27, "2022": 23, "2023": 13}}
