A question remains as to why symbiotic N2-fixing plants are more abundant in vast areas of the tropics than in many of the mature forests that seem to be nitrogen-limited in the temperate and boreal zones. Here we present a unifying framework for terrestrial N2 fixation that can explain the geographic occurrence of N2 fixers across diverse biomes and at the global scale. By examining trade-offs inherent in plant carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus capture, we find a clear advantage to symbiotic N2 fixers in phosphorus-limited tropical savannas and lowland tropical forests. The ability of N2 fixers to invest nitrogen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 792, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13499857725886293661", "cites_id": ["13499857725886293661"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07028", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nebDjRMhWbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 21, "2010": 41, "2011": 29, "2012": 46, "2013": 45, "2014": 47, "2015": 57, "2016": 60, "2017": 53, "2018": 70, "2019": 68, "2020": 72, "2021": 85, "2022": 61, "2023": 27}}
