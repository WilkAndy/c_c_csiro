It was found that the soil respiration increases exponentially with soil temperature at 5\u2003cm depth (Ts) according to the relation Rg=a\u2003exp(bTs), and the more advanced forest community during succession has a higher value of a because of higher litter carbon input than the forests at early or middle succession stages. It was also found that the monthly soil respiration is linearly correlated with the aboveground litter carbon input of the previous month. Using measurements of aboveground litter and soil respiration, the net primary productions (NPPs) of three forests were estimated using nonlinear inversion.
