Here we examined soil acid phosphatase activity (APA) underneath tree species in pine forest (PF), mixed pine and broadleaf forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest (MEBF) which represented the early, middle and late successional stages of subtropical forests in China, respectively. We also analyzed other indicators of P status (soil available P and N and P stoichiometry of the tree species).APA or APA per unit soil organic carbon under tree species was relatively low in the early successional forest.
