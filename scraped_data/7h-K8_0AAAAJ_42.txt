However, the magnitude of this response, particularly that of various ecosystem types (biomes), is uncertain. Terrestrial carbon models can be used to estimate the direction and size of the terrestrial responses expected, providing that these models have a reasonable theoretical base. We formulated a general model of ecosystem carbon fluxes by linking a process\u2010based canopy photosynthesis model to the Rothamsted soil carbon model for biomes that are not significantly affected by water limitation. The difference between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) represents net ecosystem production (NEP). The model includes (i) multiple compartments for carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10355260367149187004", "cites_id": ["10355260367149187004"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1995.tb00631.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vL-bfHBGtY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 6, "1998": 6, "1999": 13, "2000": 13, "2001": 12, "2002": 9, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 8, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
