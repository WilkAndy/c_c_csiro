Mechanistic formulations of direct CO2 effects on photosynthesis have been incorporated in some physiology-based models, whereas modifications incorporating direct CO2 effects in nutrient-driven models have usually been more empirical. Physiology-based models predict considerable CO2-fertiliser effects, while nutrient driven models tend to be less sensitive to elevated ambient CO2 concentration (Ca). This paper describes how effects of elevated Ca can be incorporated in these various types of forest growth models. The magnitude of the simulated response to elevated Ca varies markedly depending on a particular model's spatial and temporal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13330769223624356628", "cites_id": ["13330769223624356628"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BT/BT9920657", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FPPWvPpnALkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 7, "1995": 9, "1996": 11, "1997": 6, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 12, "2001": 7, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
