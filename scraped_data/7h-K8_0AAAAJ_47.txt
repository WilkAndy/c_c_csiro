To evaluate the progress of research in leaf photosynthesis, plant respiration, root nutrient uptake, and carbon partitioning, we divided scientific activities into four phases: (I) initial assessments derived from our existing knowledge base to provide frameworks for experimental studies; (II) experimental tests of the initial assessments; (III) in cases where assessments were invalidated, synthesis of experimental results to stimulate alternative hypotheses and further experimentation; and (IV) formation of new knowledge. This paper suggests that photosynthetic research may have gone through all four phases, considering that (a) variable responses of photosynthesis to [CO2] are generally explainable, (b) extrapolation of leaf\u2010level studies to the global scale has been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5336137015250923884", "cites_id": ["5336137015250923884"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.1999.00215.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bDHY4lfEDUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 12, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 8, "2005": 10, "2006": 4, "2007": 8, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
