We hypothesized that intraspecific variation in gymnosperm needle traits with latitude reflects both selection and acclimation for traits adaptive to the associated temperature and moisture gradient. This hypothesis was supported, because across 127 sites along a 2,160-km gradient in North America individuals of Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, and Abies balsamea had longer needle life span and lower tissue nitrogen concentration with decreasing mean annual temperature. Similar patterns were noted for Pinus sylvestris across a north\u2013south gradient in Europe. These differences highlight needle longevity as an adaptive feature important to ecological success of boreal conifers across broad climatic ranges. Additionally, differences in leaf life span directly affect annual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:6DAfjB2iXzsC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16989535329658201611,1657255285455995496", "cites_id": ["16989535329658201611", "1657255285455995496"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1216054110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C-Y5L170xusJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 17, "2019": 18, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
