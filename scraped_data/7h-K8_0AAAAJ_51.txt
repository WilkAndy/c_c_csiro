The Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme (MOSES) and the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model are described and compared. The impact on the simulated present day land surface climatology is assessed, in both atmosphere only and coupled model cases. Analysis is focused on seasonal mean precipitation and screen-level temperature, both globally and for Australia. Many of the biases from observations are common across both ACCESS versions and both atmosphere only and coupled cases. Where the simulations from the two versions differ, the choice of land surface model is often only a small contributor with changes to the cloud \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2353072145388386301", "cites_id": ["2353072145388386301"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/es/ES13005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_be9LKbKpyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 8, "2015": 12, "2016": 17, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 17, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
