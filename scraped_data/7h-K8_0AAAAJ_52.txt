To isolate the effects of model structural uncertainty on the global distribution of soil carbon stocks and turnover times we developed a soil biogeochemical testbed that forces three different soil models with consistent climate and plant productivity inputs. The models tested here include a first\u2010order, microbial implicit approach (CASA\u2010CNP), and two recently developed microbially explicit models that can be run at global scales (MIMICS and CORPSE). When forced with common environmental drivers, the soil models generated similar estimates of initial soil carbon stocks (roughly 1,400 Pg C globally, 0\u2013100 cm), but each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:rIeyUKJ4rSMC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17744972489727511014", "cites_id": ["17744972489727511014"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13979", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5olJZ3bOQvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 24, "2021": 24, "2022": 26, "2023": 15}}
