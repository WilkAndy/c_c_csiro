In the FACE model\u2010data synthesis project, 11 TEMs were applied to two decadelong FACE experiments in temperate forests of the southeastern U.S.\u2014the evergreen Duke Forest and the deciduous Oak Ridge Forest. In this baseline paper, we demonstrate our approach to model\u2010data synthesis by evaluating the models' ability to reproduce observed net primary productivity (NPP), transpiration, and leaf area index (LAI) in ambient CO2 treatments. Model outputs were compared against observations using a range of goodness\u2010of\u2010fit statistics. Many models simulated annual NPP and transpiration within observed uncertainty. We demonstrate, however, that high goodness\u2010of\u2010fit values do not necessarily indicate a successful model, because simulation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:xmdbLjM3F_sC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7789770893005007945", "cites_id": ["7789770893005007945"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013jg002553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Saw971rTGmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 12, "2016": 16, "2017": 12, "2018": 10, "2019": 19, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
