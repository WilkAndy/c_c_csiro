Previous research suggests an increasing long\u2010term trend in annual EWUE over many regions and is largely attributed to the physiological effects of rising CO2. The seasonal trends in EWUE, however, have not yet been analyzed. In this study, we investigate seasonal EWUE trends and responses to various drivers during 1982\u20132008. The seasonal cycle for two variants of EWUE, water\u2010use efficiency (WUE, GPP/ET), and transpiration\u2010based WUE (WUEt, the ratio of GPP and transpiration), is analyzed from 0.5\u00b0 gridded fields from four process\u2010based models and satellite\u2010based products, as well as a network of 63 local flux tower observations. WUE derived from flux tower observations shows moderate seasonal variation for most latitude bands \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:qqRC41JmxUcC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9104578339678384351", "cites_id": ["9104578339678384351"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13180", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3_A-BsP1WX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 11, "2020": 18, "2021": 21, "2022": 22, "2023": 13}}
