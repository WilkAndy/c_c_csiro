These gases are important contributors to the radiative forcing and the chemistry of the atmosphere. Quantitative information is summarized from the available studies. Between 5 and 40% of the global soil\u2013atmosphere exchange for these gases (CH4, CO, N2O, and NOx) may occur in semiarid and arid zones, but for each of these gases there are fewer than a dozen studies to support the individual estimates, and these are from a limited number of locations. Significant differences in the biophysical and chemical processes controlling these trace gas exchanges are identified through the comparison of semiarid and arid zones with the moist temperate or wet/dry savanna land regions. Therefore, there is a poorly quantified understanding of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4057616115450490975", "cites_id": ["4057616115450490975"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2006.0445", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X7BT3FuMTzgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 10, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 11, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
