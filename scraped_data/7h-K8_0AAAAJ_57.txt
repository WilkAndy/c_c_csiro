Spatial relationships between WUE and climate variables were further explored through regression analyses.Global WUE estimated by two satellite\u2010based datasets is 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 and 1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009g C m\u22122\u2009mm\u22121 lower than the simulations from four process\u2010based models (2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009g C m\u22122\u2009mm\u22121) but comparable within the uncertainty of both approaches.
