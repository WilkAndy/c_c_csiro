The implication is that CO2-enhanced carbon storage (CO2-ECS) by tropical biomes is negating the output of CO2 from deforestation. We describe here a 10-biome model for CO2-ECS, in which carbon accumulation in living vegetation is coupled to the Rothamsted soil carbon model. A biotic growth factor (\u03b2) was used to describe the relationship between literature estimates of net primary production (NPP) and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Using \u03b2 = 0.3 as a reference state, CO2-ECS by the global biosphere in 1990 was 1.1 Gt. When more appropriate values of \u03b2 were used (derived from a theoretical response of vegetation to increasing temperature and CO2), CO2-ECS was 1.3 Gt, of which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14180020358883859997", "cites_id": ["14180020358883859997"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BT/BT9920641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HV4UL2ONycQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 8, "1996": 6, "1997": 7, "1998": 6, "1999": 10, "2000": 5, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
