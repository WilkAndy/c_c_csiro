The Eucalyptus Free\u2010Air CO2 Enrichment (EucFACE) experiment, recently established in a nutrient\u2010 and water\u2010limited woodland presents a unique opportunity to address this uncertainty, but can best do so if key model uncertainties have been identified in advance. We applied seven vegetation models, which have previously been comprehensively assessed against earlier forest FACE experiments, to simulate a priori possible outcomes from EucFACE. Our goals were to provide quantitative projections against which to evaluate data as they are collected, and to identify key measurements that should be made in the experiment to allow discrimination among alternative model assumptions in a postexperiment model intercomparison \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:p2iGfxNeIOAC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11517772096861672966", "cites_id": ["11517772096861672966"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BpZYxbJY158J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 12, "2018": 4, "2019": 16, "2020": 19, "2021": 17, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
