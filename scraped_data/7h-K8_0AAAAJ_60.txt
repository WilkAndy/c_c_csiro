Here we use natural variations in N isotopes, coupled with two models, to trace global pathways of N loss from the land to the water and atmosphere. We show that denitrification accounts for approximately 35 % of total N losses from the natural soil, with NO, N2O, and N2 fluxes equal to 15.7 \u00b1 4.7 Tg N yr\u22121, 10.2 \u00b1 3.0 Tg N yr\u22121, and 21.0 \u00b1 6.1 Tg N yr\u22121, respectively. Our analysis points to tropical regions as the major \"hotspot\" of nitrogen export from the terrestrial biosphere, accounting for 71 % of global N losses from the natural land surface. The poorly studied Congo Basin is further identified as one of the major natural sources of atmospheric N2O. Extra-tropical areas, by contrast, lose a greater fraction of N via leaching pathways (~77 % of total N losses) than do tropical biomes, likely contributing to N limitations of CO2 uptake at higher latitudes. Our results provide an independent constraint on global models of the N cycle among different regions of the unfertilized biosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10185821845511513162", "cites_id": ["10185821845511513162"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/3287/2012/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SqQgbwBPW40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 17, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
