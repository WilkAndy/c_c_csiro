Don tree growing in a New Zealand plantation. Measurements included above\u2010 and below\u2010canopy irradiance, leaf stable carbon isotopic composition (\u03b413C) and tree canopy architecture. The radiation absorption component of the model, MAESTRO, was tested on site and then used to determine the branch tip distribution of intercepted radiation. We hypothesized that in branch tip needles: (i) the allocation of nitrogen and other nutrients would be closely associated with the distribution of intercepted radiation, reflecting carbon gain optimization theory, and (ii) Ci would predominantly reflect changes in photosynthetic rate (A) rather than stomatal conductance (gs), indicating that the increase in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11397215438981301389", "cites_id": ["11397215438981301389"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1998.00314.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jQQUhQ4LK54J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 9, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
