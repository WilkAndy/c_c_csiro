However, the observed responses to increased acid inputs are quite variable among different forest soils, and the reasons remain unclear. To study the causes for the different responses, soil columns taken from a young pine forest (PF) and an old evergreen broadleaved forest (BF) were applied three levels of acid addition treatments for 60\u202fdays. We found that the PF soils were quite acid-sensitive, and the high acid treatment significantly decreased soil pH at 0\u201320\u202fcm soil layer while significantly increased exchangeable H+ at both 0\u201320 and 20\u201340\u202fcm soil layers. Both the low and high acid treatments significantly increased exchangeable Na+ at 0\u201320\u202fcm soil layer and Ca2+ and Mg2+ at 20\u201340\u202fcm soil layer. Furthermore, the high acid treatment also significantly increased leaching losses of H+, Ca2+, Mg2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:zmJoL7Ye8dcC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6160618727613578024", "cites_id": ["6160618727613578024"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254118305126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KLsGqBfqflUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 26, "2022": 30, "2023": 12}}
