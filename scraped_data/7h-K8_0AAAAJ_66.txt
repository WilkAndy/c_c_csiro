However, stomatal conductance schemes commonly assume that all vegetation with the same photosynthetic pathway use identical plant water use strategies whereas observations indicate otherwise. Here, we implement a new stomatal scheme derived from optimal stomatal theory and constrained by a recent global synthesis of stomatal conductance measurements from 314 species, across 56 field sites. Using this new stomatal scheme, within a global climate model, subtantially increases the intensity of future heatwaves across Northern Eurasia. This indicates that our climate model has previously been under-predicting heatwave intensity. Our results have widespread implications for other climate models, many of which do not account for differences in stomatal water-use \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:TSH-eZa2y_MC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7112643072899264884", "cites_id": ["7112643072899264884"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/srep23418.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dLFNvjAvtWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 19, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
