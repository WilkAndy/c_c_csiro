Adding nitrogen limitation strongly reduces the capacity of land CO2 uptake under increasing [CO2]. The further limitation by phosphorous has a smaller impact on the global uptake of CO2. However, phosphorous limitation has a strong impact on regional carbon uptake: increasing CO2 sinks over North America and Eurasia and decreasing sinks over China and Australia. Thus, while the global carbon balance can be resolved with just nitrogen limitation, simulations of continental\u2010scale carbon sinks will need to include the additional limitation of phosphorous through the 20th century."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10708691382869921990", "cites_id": ["10708691382869921990"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011GL049244", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xpA_XRPqnJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 11, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
