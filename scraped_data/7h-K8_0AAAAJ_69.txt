Here we analyse the four decade-long CO2-enrichment experiments in woody ecosystems that measured total NPP and biomass. CO2 enrichment increased biomass increment by 1.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u2009kg\u2009C\u2009m\u22122 over a full decade, a 29.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.7% stimulation of biomass gain in these early-secondary-succession temperate ecosystems. This response is predictable by combining the CO2 response of NPP (0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009kg\u2009C\u2009m\u22122\u2009y\u22121) and the CO2-independent, linear slope between biomass increment and cumulative NPP (0.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.17). An ensemble of terrestrial ecosystem models fail to predict both terms correctly. Allocation to wood was a driver of across-site, and across-model, response variability and together with CO2-independence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:Gp7G-LMh-YMC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3735700683024010969", "cites_id": ["3735700683024010969"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08348-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2Y7Uhvrf1zMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 16, "2021": 24, "2022": 19, "2023": 13}}
