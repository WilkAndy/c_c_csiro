In this study, we introduced a semi-analytical solution (SAS) for the spin-up issue. SAS is fundamentally based on the analytic solution to a set of equations that describe carbon transfers within ecosystems over time. SAS is implemented by three steps: (1) having an initial spin-up with prior pool-size values until net primary productivity (NPP) reaches stabilization, (2) calculating quasi-steady-state pool sizes by letting fluxes of the equations equal zero, and (3)  having a final spin-up to meet the criterion of steady state. Step 2 is enabled by averaged time-varying variables over one period of repeated driving forcings. SAS was applied to both site-level and global scale spin-up of the Australian Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model. For the carbon-cycle-only simulations, SAS saved 95.7% and 92.4% of computational time for site-level and global spin-up, respectively, in comparison with the traditional method (a long-term iterative simulation to achieve the steady states of variables). For the carbon\u2013nitrogen coupled simulations, SAS reduced computational cost by 84.5% and 86.6% for site-level and global spin-up, respectively. The estimated steady-state pool sizes represent the ecosystem carbon storage capacity, which was 12.1 kg C m\u22122 with the coupled carbon\u2013nitrogen global model, 14.6% lower than that with the carbon-only model. The nitrogen down-regulation in modeled carbon storage is partly due to the 4.6% decrease in carbon influx (i.e., net \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16417043550463949165", "cites_id": ["16417043550463949165"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/5/1259/2012/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bXmFvyAO1eMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
