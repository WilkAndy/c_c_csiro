The fate of N2O in the subsoil has often been placed in the \u2018too hard\u2019 basket. However, determining the production, fate and movement of N2O in the subsoil is vital in fully understanding the sources of surface fluxes and in compiling accurate inventories for N2O emissions. The aim of this study was to generate and introduce into soil columns 15N labelled N2O, and to try and determine the consumption of the 15N2O and production of ambient N2O. Columns, 100cm long by 15cm diameter, were repacked with sieved soil (sampled from 0 to 5cm depth) and instrumented with silicone rubber gas sampling ports. Nitrous oxide enriched with 15N was generated using a thermal decomposition process at 300\u00b0C and then transferred to 2l flasks. After equilibrating with SF6 tracer gas the 15N2O was introduced into the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13873959247123196561", "cites_id": ["13873959247123196561"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003807170500413X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kSoGiW00isAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 11, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
