Sensitivity analyses show that different cultivars have quite different responses to changes in ambient air temperature, ambient CO\u2082 concentration and rainfall. Because crops reach maturity earlier under higher temperature, an increase of 3 \u00b0C may not impose further water stress to growth of a wheat crop in Victoria, Australia. However shorter maturation time may lead to a net decrease in crop biomass accumulation and potential grain yield in some early maturing cultivars. It is suggested that selection of suitable cultivars is one of the key strategies for coping with climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17547787820626470465", "cites_id": ["17547787820626470465"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24863368", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QeZd-gxEhvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 6, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
