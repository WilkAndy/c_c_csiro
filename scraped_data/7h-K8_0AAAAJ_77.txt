However, recent studies have suggested that the increased C input can also stimulate the decomposition of old SOC via priming. Whether the loss of old SOC by priming can override C replenishment has not been rigorously examined. Here we show, through data\u2013model synthesis, that the magnitude of replenishment is greater than that of priming, resulting in a net increase in SOC by a mean of 32% of the added new C. The magnitude of the net increase in SOC is positively correlated with the nitrogen-to-C ratio of the added substrates. Additionally, model evaluation indicates that a two-pool interactive model is a parsimonious model to represent the SOC decomposition with priming and replenishment. Our findings suggest that increasing C input to soils likely promote SOC accumulation despite the enhanced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:YynyIpEqGK0C", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9054693103524023075", "cites_id": ["9054693103524023075"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05667-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I4u6YWe7qH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 23, "2023": 12}}
