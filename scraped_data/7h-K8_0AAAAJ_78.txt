The annual total of net leaf photosynthesis was 110% more in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2. However, the trees in elevated CO2 grew only 59% more biomass than the trees in ambient CO2 over the year. Modelling studies showed that larger loss of carbon from fine\u2010root production and growth of the root\u2010associated mycorrhiza by the trees in elevated CO2 probably accounted for all the remaining difference in net photosynthesis between the two treatments. Our modelling also showed that the fraction of net photosynthate consumed by respiration of nonleaf tissue was similar in the two CO2 treatments, and was 26% and 24% for trees in ambient and elevated CO2, respectively.Trees in elevated CO2 had 43% more leaves, and produced 110% more net photosynthate than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12124991374296986962", "cites_id": ["12124991374296986962"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2486.1998.00170.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UrWl-WmfRKgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 8, "2000": 3, "2001": 10, "2002": 7, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3}}
