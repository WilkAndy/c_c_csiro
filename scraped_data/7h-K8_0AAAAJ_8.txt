This is an extraordinary challenge. To our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively detect and attribute a greening trend in China over the last three decades. We use three different satellite\u2010derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) datasets for detection as well as five different process\u2010based ecosystem models for attribution. Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition are identified as the most likely causes of the greening trend in China, explaining 85% and 41% of the average growing\u2010season LAI trend (LAIGS) estimated by satellite datasets (average trend of 0.0070 yr\u22121, ranging from 0.0035 yr\u22121 to 0.0127 yr\u22121), respectively. The contribution of nitrogen deposition is more clearly seen in southern China than in the north of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:0ju6dEALV5wC", "num_citations": 561, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14210849522836341413", "cites_id": ["14210849522836341413"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12795", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pYIwRVkUN8UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 30, "2017": 31, "2018": 49, "2019": 55, "2020": 81, "2021": 102, "2022": 141, "2023": 62}}
