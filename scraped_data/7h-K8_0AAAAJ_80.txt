Ecosystem GPP cannot be measured directly, and is commonly estimated using models. Among the many parameters in those models, three leaf parameters have strong influences on the modelled GPP: leaf mass per area, leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen concentration. The first two parameters affect the modelled canopy leaf area and the last two determine the maximal leaf photosynthetic rate. Ecological studies have firmly established that these three parameters are significantly correlated at regional to global scales, but this knowledge is yet to be used in predicting global GPP. We hypothesize that incorporating multi\u2010trait covariance can reduce uncertainties of model predictions in a way likely to provide improved realism. Using the Australian community land surface model (CABLE), we find \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2793471436505428348", "cites_id": ["2793471436505428348"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2012GL053461", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fDEbl3hnxCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
