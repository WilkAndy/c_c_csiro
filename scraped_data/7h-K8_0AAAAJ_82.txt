Despite extensive modeling and experimental and observational studies, what fundamentally determines transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage under global change is still not very clear. Here we develop a new framework for understanding transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage through mathematical analysis and numerical experiments. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate force driving ecosystem C storage change is the C storage capacity, which is jointly determined by ecosystem C input (e.g., net primary production, NPP) and residence time. Since both C input and residence time vary with time, the C storage capacity is time-dependent and acts as a moving attractor that actual C storage chases. The rate of change in C storage is proportional to the C storage potential, which is the difference between the current storage and the storage capacity. The C storage capacity represents instantaneous responses of the land C cycle to external forcing, whereas the C storage potential represents the internal capability of the land C cycle to influence the C change trajectory in the next time step. The influence happens through redistribution of net C pool changes in a network of pools with different residence times. Moreover, this and our other studies have demonstrated that one matrix equation can replicate simulations of most land C cycle models (i.e., physical emulators). As a result, simulation outputs of those models can be placed into a three-dimensional (3-D \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:xiLpnPg9mi8C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11713480801262168171", "cites_id": ["11713480801262168171"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/14/145/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a-iWYrqkjqIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
