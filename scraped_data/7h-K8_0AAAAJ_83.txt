However, a comprehensive evaluation of the elevated CO2 impact on plant nitrogen\u200a:\u200aphosphorus (N:P) ratios and the underlying mechanism has not been conducted. We synthesized the results from 112 previously published studies using meta\u2010analysis to evaluate the effects of elevated CO2 on the N:P ratio of terrestrial plants and to explore the underlying mechanism based on plant growth and soil P dynamics. Our results show that terrestrial plants grown under elevated CO2 had lower N:P ratios in both above\u2010 and belowground biomass across different ecosystem types. The response ratio for plant N:P was negatively correlated with the response ratio for plant growth in croplands and grasslands, and showed a stronger relationship for P than for N. In addition, the CO2\u2010induced down\u2010regulation of plant N:P was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:_UIRw3K-QSMC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8119977181167513114", "cites_id": ["8119977181167513114"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/15-0217.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gm7Eizn0r3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 12, "2018": 3, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 16, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
