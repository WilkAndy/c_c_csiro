However, these processes are poorly represented in global land surface models. In this study, we incorporated two root functions: a root water uptake function which assumes root water uptake efficiency varies with rooting depth, and a hydraulic redistribution function into a global land surface model, CABLE. The water uptake function developed by Lai and Katul (2000) was also compared with the default one (see Wang et al., 2010) that assumes that efficiency of water uptake per unit root length is constant. Using eddy flux measurements of CO2 and water vapor fluxes at three sites experiencing different patterns of seasonal changes in soil water content, we showed that the two root functions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3068678542210535697", "cites_id": ["3068678542210535697"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2012JG002038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EZFSJuAilioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
