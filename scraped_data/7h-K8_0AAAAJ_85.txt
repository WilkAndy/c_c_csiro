Under normal range of precipitation variability, wet years typically result in ANPP gains being larger than ANPP declines in dry years (positive asymmetry), whereas increases in ANPP are lower in magnitude in extreme wet years compared to reductions during extreme drought (negative asymmetry). Whether the current generation of ecosystem models with a coupled carbon\u2013water system in grasslands are capable of simulating these asymmetric ANPP responses is an unresolved question. In this study, we evaluated the simulated responses of temperate grassland primary productivity to scenarios of altered precipitation with 14 ecosystem models at three sites: Shortgrass steppe (SGS), Konza Prairie (KNZ) and Stubai Valley meadow (STU), spanning a rainfall gradient from dry to moist. We found that (1) the spatial slopes derived from modeled primary productivity and precipitation across sites were steeper than the temporal slopes obtained from inter-annual variations, which was consistent with empirical data; (2) the asymmetry of the responses of modeled primary productivity under normal inter-annual precipitation variability differed among models, and the mean of the model ensemble suggested a negative asymmetry across the three sites, which was contrary to empirical evidence based on filed observations; (3) the mean sensitivity of modeled productivity to rainfall suggested greater negative response with reduced precipitation than positive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:NOsVDcwM7ZYC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8382401748574975602", "cites_id": ["8382401748574975602"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/15/3421/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:crZsfPpFVHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
