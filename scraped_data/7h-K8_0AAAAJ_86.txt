Grazed legume pasture is one of the major agricultural land uses in southern Australia and no N2O emission studies have been undertaken previously on this system. A study over 1 year has been undertaken measuring N2O emissions from legume pasture at Wagga Wagga, Australia. The study was embedded within a larger on-farm study of the management of acid soils. Sampling involved simultaneous N2O emission measurements on two paddocks each of: acidic soil with pH 4.0; limed soil with soil pH 5.5, and limed soil with addition of 20gNm\u22122 of animal urine. The average emission of N2O from the acidic legume pasture was 0.35kgNha\u22121y\u22121 with a standard error of 0.03kgNha\u22121y\u22121. Isotope measurements indicated that in aerobic conditions the ratio of N2O emissions to gross mineralisation was 0.01\u20130.05%.
