The interaction was synergistic for leaf P and soil NO3-N only in tropical forests, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:b6LYR6tDxhYC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17189118980998853475", "cites_id": ["17189118980998853475"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-019-04119-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y3NcMKQEjO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 27, "2023": 9}}
