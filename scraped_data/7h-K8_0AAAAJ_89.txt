Increases in anthropogenic N have had multiple effects on the atmosphere, on terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and even on human health. Unfortunately, methodological limitations challenge our ability to directly measure natural N inputs via biological N fixation (BNF)\u2014the largest natural source of new N to ecosystems. This confounds efforts to quantify the extent of anthropogenic perturbation to the N cycle. To address this gap, we used a pair of indirect methods\u2014analytical modeling and N balance\u2014to generate independent estimates of BNF in a presumed hotspot of N fixation, a tropical rain forest site in central Rond\u00f4nia in the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Our objectives were to attempt to constrain symbiotic N fixation rates in this site using indirect methods, and to assess strengths and weaknesses of this approach by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9057880195139113997", "cites_id": ["9057880195139113997"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-009-9392-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DRRQ-QsOtH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
