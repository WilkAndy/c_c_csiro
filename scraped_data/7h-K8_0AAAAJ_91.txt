By decomposing GPP into leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthesis per leaf area (i.e., GPP_leaf), we investigated the IAV of GPP and the mechanisms responsible in a temperate grassland of northwestern China. We further assessed six ecosystem models for their capabilities in reproducing the observed IAV of GPP in a temperate grassland from 2004 to 2011 in China. We observed that the responses to LAI and GPP_leaf to soil water significantly contributed to IAV of GPP at the grassland ecosystem. Two of six models with prescribed LAI simulated of the observed IAV of GPP quite well, but still underestimated the variance of GPP_leaf, therefore the variance of GPP. In comparison, simulated pattern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ZJxCuUMT1foC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17307857986927992642", "cites_id": ["17307857986927992642"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14274", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qh_AXSPdMfAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 15, "2021": 8, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
