Savannas are open-canopy environments that encompass a broad demographic continuum, often characterised by a changing dominance between C3-tree and C4-grass vegetation, where frequent environmental disturbances such as fire modulates the balance between ephemeral and perennial life forms. Climate change is projected to result in significant changes to the savanna floristic structure, with increases to woody biomass expected through CO2 fertilisation in mesic savannas and increased tree mortality expected through increased rainfall interannual variability in xeric savannas. The complex interaction between vegetation and climate that occurs in savannas has traditionally challenged terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which aim to simulate the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface to predict responses of vegetation to changing in environmental forcing. In this review, we examine whether TBMs are able to adequately represent savanna fluxes and what implications potential deficiencies may have for climate change projection scenarios that rely on these models. We start by highlighting the defining characteristic traits and behaviours of savannas, how these differ across continents and how this information is (or is not) represented in the structural framework of many TBMs. We highlight three dynamic processes that we believe directly affect the water use and productivity of the savanna system: phenology \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:SKbDCQBpHTkC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15942984264293991372", "cites_id": ["15942984264293991372"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2016-190/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zMPiBLjbQN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 15, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
