Allocation of the accumulated carbon was quite different between these two forests: the young forest accumulated a significant amount of carbon in plant live biomass, whereas the old-growth forest accumulated a significant amount of carbon in the soil. From 1982 to 2004, net primary productivity (NPP) increased for the young forest, and did not change significantly for the old-growth forest. The increase in NPP of the young forest resulted from recruitment of some dominant tree species characteristic of the subtropical mature forest in the region and an increase in tree density; decline of NPP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8176393800460121637", "cites_id": ["8176393800460121637"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-011-9914-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JbYhVNdieHEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
