New soil biogeochemical models have been developed, but their evaluation is limited to observations from laboratory incubations or few field experiments. Given the global scope of ESMs, a comprehensive evaluation of such models is essential using in situ observations of a wide range of SOC stocks over large spatial scales before their introduction to ESMs. In this study, we collected a set of in situ observations of SOC, litterfall and soil properties from 206 sites covering different forest and soil types in Europe and China. These data were used to calibrate the model MIMICS (The MIcrobial\u2010MIneral Carbon Stabilization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:ybgmOu3m07wC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1752562792448696795", "cites_id": ["1752562792448696795"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14994", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:26F4ApNaUhgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 24, "2022": 16, "2023": 7}}
