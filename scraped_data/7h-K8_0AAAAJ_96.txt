A promising method for estimating LUE is through remote sensing of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). However, there are internal (e.g. pigment concentrations) and external factors (e.g. environmental conditions and sun-target-view geometry) that affect PRI signals. Considering the reflectance difference between sunlit and shaded leaves, the ratio of observed canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance is used to represent the observed fraction of sunlit leaves, and the observed fraction of shaded leaves is calculated with a geometrical optical model. Thus, a canopy-level PRI observation is separated into sunlit and shaded PRI values, and a two-leaf canopy PRI (PRIt) is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:kSfMFMOdMMkC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7408351689982672572", "cites_id": ["7408351689982672572"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717301050", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vP6UZJzAz2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 14, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
