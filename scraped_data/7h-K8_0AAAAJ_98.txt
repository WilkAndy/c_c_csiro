Modelling vegetation responses to changes in rainfall is thus crucial to project water and carbon cycles in the future. In this study, we present the results of a new model\u2010data intercomparison project, where we tested the ability of 10 terrestrial biosphere models to reproduce the observed sensitivity of ecosystem productivity to rainfall changes at 10 sites across the globe, in nine of which, rainfall exclusion and/or irrigation experiments had been performed. The key results are as follows: (a) Inter\u2010model variation is generally large and model agreement varies with timescales. In severely water\u2010limited sites, models only agree on the interannual variability of evapotranspiration and to a smaller extent on gross primary productivity.
