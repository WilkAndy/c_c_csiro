We applied 10 TBMs to the multifactor Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) experiment in Wyoming, USA. Our goals were to investigate how multifactor experiments can be used to constrain models and to identify a road map for model improvement. We found models performed poorly in ambient conditions; there was a wide spread in simulated above\u2010ground net primary productivity (range: 31\u2013390 g C m\u22122 yr\u22121). Comparison with data highlighted model failures particularly with respect to carbon allocation, phenology, and the impact of water stress on phenology. Performance against the observations from single\u2010factors treatments was also relatively poor. In addition, similar responses were predicted for different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "7h-K8_0AAAAJ:etrBy31LU9kC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10666692455722023829", "cites_id": ["10666692455722023829"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/GCB.13643", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lXumH0a0B5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 16, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
