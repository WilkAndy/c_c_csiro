The method is used to fabricate an industrially relevant distributed feedback (DFB) cavity, which is a critical step toward all-electrially pumped injection laser diodes. This approach opens the prospects of perovskite materials for much improved optical control in LEDs, solar cells, and also toward applications as optical devices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10564205663653558300", "cites_id": ["10564205663653558300"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201502608", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HHg9XBSZm5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 26, "2017": 43, "2018": 45, "2019": 45, "2020": 43, "2021": 39, "2022": 30, "2023": 8}}
