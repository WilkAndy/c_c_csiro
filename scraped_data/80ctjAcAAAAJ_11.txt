Our findings indicate the perovskite film is tolerant to most of the considered homovalent metal species with lead\u2013cobalt compositions yielding the highest power conversion efficiencies when less than 6% of the Pb2+ ions are replaced. Through subsequent materials characterisation, we demonstrate for the first time that partially substituting Pb2+ at the B-sites of the perovskite lattice is not restricted to Group IV elements but is also possible with at least Co2+. Moreover, adjusting the molar ratio of Pb:Co in the mixed-metal perovskite affords new opportunities to tailor the material properties while maintaining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 244, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1579545280022861907", "cites_id": ["1579545280022861907"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/ee/c6ee03201j", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U1hoOhCs6xUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 26, "2018": 46, "2019": 43, "2020": 44, "2021": 43, "2022": 29, "2023": 13}}
