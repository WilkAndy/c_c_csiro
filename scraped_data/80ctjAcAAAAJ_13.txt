The gate materials, buffer concentration and surface condition of graphene have been optimized to achieve the DNA detection sensitivity as low as 1pM (10\u221212M), which is more sensitive than the existing report based on few-layer graphene. The graphene films obtained using conventional PMMA-assisted transfer technique exhibits PMMA residues, which degrade the sensing performance of graphene. We have demonstrated that the sensing performance of the graphene samples prepared by gold-transfer is largely enhanced (by 125%)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 216, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=540624842780474735", "cites_id": ["540624842780474735"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566312005015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b32uHm6vgAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 21, "2015": 26, "2016": 25, "2017": 17, "2018": 19, "2019": 29, "2020": 25, "2021": 22, "2022": 17, "2023": 6}}
