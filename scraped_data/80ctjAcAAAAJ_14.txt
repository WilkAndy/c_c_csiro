One possible cause, suggested for the hysteresis, is polarization of the perovskite layer under applied voltage and illumination bias, due to ion migration within the perovskite. To study this problem systemically, current\u2013voltage characteristics of both regular (light incident through the electron conducting contact) and so-called inverted (light incident through the hole conducting contact) perovskite cells were studied at different temperatures and scan rates. We explain our results by assuming that the effects of scan rate and temperature on hysteresis are strongly correlated to ion migration within the device, with the rate-determining step being ion migration at/across the interfaces of the perovskite layer with the contact materials.
