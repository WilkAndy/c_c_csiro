We find that local photoluminescence variations present in confocal imaging are also observed in wide-field imaging, while intensity-dependent confocal measurements show that the heterogeneity in nonradiative losses observed at low excitation powers becomes less pronounced at higher excitation powers. Both confocal and wide-field images show that carriers undergo anisotropic diffusion due to differences in intergrain connectivity. These data are all qualitatively consistent with trap-dominated variations in local photoluminescence intensity and with grain boundaries that exhibit varying degrees of opacity to carrier transport. We use a two-dimensional kinetic model to simulate and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2527569158664360279", "cites_id": ["2527569158664360279"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.7b06242", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VxFsF8K6EyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 21, "2019": 30, "2020": 19, "2021": 32, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
