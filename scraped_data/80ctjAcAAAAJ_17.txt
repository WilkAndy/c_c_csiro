PBI/HMI-Tf composite membranes with different HMI-Tf concentrations have been prepared. The ionic conductivity of the PBI/HMI-Tf composite membranes increased with both the temperature and the HMI-Tf content. The composite membranes achieve high ionic conductivity (1.6\u00d7 10\u2212 2 S/cm) at 250\u25e6 C under anhydrous conditions. Although the addition of HMI-Tf resulted in a slight decrease in the methanol barrier ability and mechanical properties of the PBI membranes, the PBI/HMI-Tf composite membranes have demonstrated high thermal stability up to 300\u25e6 C, which is attractive for high-temperature (> 200\u25e6 C) polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13004996229279525764", "cites_id": ["13004996229279525764"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468610017251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hCuAxyoHe7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 13, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 15, "2020": 5, "2021": 16, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
