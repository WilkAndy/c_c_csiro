The TFTs exhibited an electron mobility of 1.40 cm2/(V\u00b7s) and an on/off current ratio of 104 with a notably low threshold voltage (\u223c1\u2009V). Furthermore, our MoS2 TFTs operated at a mechanical strain of 5% without significant degradation of their electrical properties. These results demonstrate the potential for using MoS2 films for stretchable electronics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17270364793052669752", "cites_id": ["17270364793052669752"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4813311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OCdR50aprO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 14, "2015": 14, "2016": 15, "2017": 9, "2018": 15, "2019": 10, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 7}}
