SEM images of the cross-section of the porous polymer membranes show the pore size and morphology. The cross-linking by p-xylylene dichloride can effectively improve the mechanical properties of the porous PBI membranes after phosphoric acid doping. The CpPBI-60 membrane, which is doped with 9 moles of phosphoric acid, has a tensile modulus of 0.45 GPa. The good mechanical strength of the cross-linked porous PBI membranes makes them able to hold more phosphoric acid and, consequently, have higher proton conductivity. Fenton's test indicated that the covalently cross-linked structure played an important role in the radical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17785475661791378308", "cites_id": ["17785475661791378308"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2011/jm/c1jm12857d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hDtuBuKz0vYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 8, "2015": 15, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
