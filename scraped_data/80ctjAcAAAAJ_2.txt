This is likely to continue to rise, but in the development of these solar cells there are unusual characteristics that have arisen, specifically an anomalous hysteresis in the current\u2013voltage curves. We identify this phenomenon and show some examples of factors that make the hysteresis more or less extreme. We also demonstrate stabilized power output under working conditions and suggest that this is a useful parameter to present, alongside the current-voltage scan derived power conversion efficiency. We hypothesize three possible origins of the effect and discuss its implications on device efficiency and future research directions. Understanding and resolving the hysteresis is essential for further progress and is likely to lead to a further step improvement in performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 2541, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7237462332769849860", "cites_id": ["7237462332769849860"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz500113x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BFIEXKWhcGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 71, "2015": 323, "2016": 403, "2017": 383, "2018": 369, "2019": 283, "2020": 262, "2021": 204, "2022": 172, "2023": 61}}
