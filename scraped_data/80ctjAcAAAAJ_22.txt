Device performance, however, is known to be still significantly affected by the presence of inhomogeneities. Here we report on a study of temperature dependent micro-photoluminescence which shows a strong spatial inhomogeneity related to the presence of microcrystalline grains, which can be both bright and dark. In all of the tri-iodide based materials there is evidence that the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition observed around 160 K does not occur uniformly across the sample with domain formation related to the underlying microcrystallite grains, some of which remain in the high temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13770125570469889027", "cites_id": ["13770125570469889027"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/nr/c7nr00355b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A4RhxD9QGb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 13, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
