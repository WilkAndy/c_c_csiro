However, due to the susceptible crystallization process of perovskite films on planar substrates and the high sensitivity of the physical and optoelectronic nature of the internal interfaces within the devices, researchers in different laboratories still experience poor reproducibility in fabricating efficient perovskite solar cells with planar heterojunction device structures. In this methods paper, we present detailed information on the reagents, equipment, and procedures for the fabrication of planar perovskite solar cells in both \u201cregular\u201d n-i-p and \u201cinverted\u201d p-i-n architectures based on one-step solution-processed methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films. We discuss key parameters affecting the crystallization of perovskite and the device interfaces.
