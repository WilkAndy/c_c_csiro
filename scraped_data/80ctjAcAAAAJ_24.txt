We continuously test the devices in-situ and in-operando with current-voltage sweeps, transient photocurrent, and transient photovoltage measurements, and find that degradation in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3\u2212 x Cl x solar cells due to oxygen exposure occurs over shorter timescales than FA 0.83 Cs 0.17 Pb (I 0.8 Br 0.2) 3 mixed-cation devices. We attribute these oxygen-induced losses in the power conversion efficiencies to the formation of electron traps within the perovskite photoactive layer. Our results highlight that the formamidinium-caesium mixed-cation perovskites are much less sensitive to oxygen-induced degradation than the methylammonium-based perovskite cells \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6353965684570382105", "cites_id": ["6353965684570382105"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-018-24436-6.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Gd_WFyDSLVgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 6}}
