However, significant differences in current\u2013voltage performance and hysteresis phenomena arise as a result of the chosen fabrication technique. This indicates enormous scope to optimize the electron transport layer (ETL), however, to date the understanding of the origin of these phenomena is lacking. Reported here is a first comparison of two common SnO2 ETLs with contrasting performance and hysteresis phenomena, with an experimental strategy to combine the beneficial properties in a bilayer ETL architecture. In doing so, this is demonstrated to eliminate room\u2010temperature hysteresis while simultaneously attaining impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 20%.
