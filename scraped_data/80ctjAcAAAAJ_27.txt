The general trend of increasing noise amplitude which spreads over a wider range of frequency as a function of aging is established. High\u2010resolution spatial mapping of the photocurrent in typical devices and the associated variation of the noise spectrum confirms the underlying trend."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10970358371598507824", "cites_id": ["10970358371598507824"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/solr.201700173", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MJ_cxdCKPpgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
