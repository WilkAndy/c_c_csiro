The reduced GO (rGO) sheets exhibit higher effective field-effect hole mobility, up to 80 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, and lower sheet resistance (13 k\u03a9 \u25a1\u22121) compared with those reduced by reported methods such as hydrazine and thermal annealing. Raman and XPS characterizations are addressed to study the reduction mechanism on graphene oxide underneath copper thin films. The level of reduction in rGO sheets is examined by Raman spectroscopy and it is well correlated with hole mobility values. The conductivity enhancement is attributed to the growth of the graphitic domain size. This method is not only suitable for reduction of single GO sheets but also applicable to lower the sheet resistance of Langmuir\u2013Blodgett assembled GO films."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1422599833279044791", "cites_id": ["1422599833279044791"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2011/cp/c2cp23187e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t5wg2AIXvhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
