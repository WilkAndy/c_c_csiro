Lead iodide (PbI2) and pyridine have been shown to passivate these defects. We treat methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films with pyridine solutions to investigate the effects of the two passivators. By comparing confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) images at 405 nm excitation and then at 559 nm excitation we demonstrate the pyridine treatment passivates and forms PbI2 crystallites which cause additional passivation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=759777581324537854", "cites_id": ["759777581324537854"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ra/d0ra04641h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_o8nS69FiwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
