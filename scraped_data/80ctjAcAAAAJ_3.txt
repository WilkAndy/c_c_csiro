Fundamental to understanding the operation of these devices is the exciton binding energy, which has proved both difficult to measure directly and controversial. We demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy, which we find to be only 16 meV at low temperatures, over three times smaller than has been previously assumed. In the room-temperature phase we show that the binding energy falls to even smaller values of only a few millielectronvolts, which explains their excellent device performance as being due to spontaneous free-carrier generation following light absorption. Additionally, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 1834, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17153186884456586073", "cites_id": ["17153186884456586073"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WZvsBZdcDO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 28, "2016": 173, "2017": 201, "2018": 253, "2019": 290, "2020": 259, "2021": 263, "2022": 257, "2023": 106}}
