However, the devices suffer from low performance. We boost the power conversion efficiency of devices with transition metal complex HTMs from 2% to above 10% through energy level tuning. We further demonstrate the excellent photostability of the device based on the additive-free HTM."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1829642642433125383", "cites_id": ["1829642642433125383"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/cc/d1cc00060h", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BywiGEoyZBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
