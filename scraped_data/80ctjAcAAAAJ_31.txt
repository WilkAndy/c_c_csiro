Unfortunately, despite this wealth of deposition approaches, the community experiences a great deal of irreproducibility between different laboratories, batches and preparation methods. Aiming to address this issue, we developed a simple deposition method based on gas quenching that yields smooth films for a wide range of perovskite compositions, in single, double, triple and quadruple cation varieties, and produces planar heterojunction devices with competitive efficiencies, so far up to 20%."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17700836706700393635", "cites_id": ["17700836706700393635"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8547987/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o3wSojMBpvUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
