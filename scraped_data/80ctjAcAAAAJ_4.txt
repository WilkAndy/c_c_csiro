We develop an infrared-absorbing 1.2\u2013electron volt band-gap perovskite, FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3, that can deliver 14.8% efficiency. By combining this material with a wider\u2013band gap FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3 material, we achieve monolithic two-terminal tandem efficiencies of 17.0% with >1.65-volt open-circuit voltage. We also make mechanically stacked four-terminal tandem cells and obtain 20.3% efficiency. Notably, we find  that our infrared-absorbing perovskite cells exhibit excellent thermal and atmospheric stability, not previously achieved for Sn-based perovskites. This device architecture and materials set will enable \u201call-perovskite\u201d thin-film solar cells to reach the highest efficiencies in the long term at the lowest costs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 1219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7463155700400188119", "cites_id": ["7463155700400188119"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf9717", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1-rIaZF0kmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 142, "2018": 202, "2019": 180, "2020": 235, "2021": 173, "2022": 203, "2023": 75}}
