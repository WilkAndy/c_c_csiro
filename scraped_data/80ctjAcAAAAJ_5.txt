This is unfavorable for low-cost production, applications on plastic substrates, and multijunction device architectures. Here we report a low-cost, solution-based deposition procedure utilizing nanocomposites of graphene and TiO2 nanoparticles as the electron collection layers in meso-superstructured perovskite solar cells. The graphene nanoflakes provide superior charge-collection in the nanocomposites, enabling the entire device to be fabricated at temperatures no higher than 150 \u00b0C. These solar cells show remarkable photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency up to 15.6%. This work demonstrates that graphene/metal oxide nanocomposites have the potential to contribute significantly toward the development of low-cost solar cells."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 1176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15149965561158808010", "cites_id": ["15149965561158808010"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl403997a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yrFF8Gh9P9IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 90, "2015": 175, "2016": 178, "2017": 153, "2018": 200, "2019": 118, "2020": 91, "2021": 94, "2022": 54, "2023": 20}}
