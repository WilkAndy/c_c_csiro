Over the past few years, the long-term operational stability of such devices has been greatly improved by tuning the composition of the perovskites\u2013, optimizing the interfaces within the device structures\u2013, and using new encapsulation techniques,. However, further improvements are required in order to deliver a longer-lasting technology. Ion migration in the perovskite active layer\u2014especially under illumination and heat\u2014is arguably the most difficult aspect to mitigate\u2013. Here we incorporate ionic liquids into the perovskite film and thence into positive\u2013intrinsic\u2013negative photovoltaic devices, increasing the device efficiency and markedly improving the long-term device stability. Specifically, we observe a degradation in performance of only around five per cent for the most stable encapsulated device under \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 975, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15737640221374297388", "cites_id": ["15737640221374297388"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1357-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LDXqVWZUZ9oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 14, "2020": 246, "2021": 291, "2022": 297, "2023": 124}}
