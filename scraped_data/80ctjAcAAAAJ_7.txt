There has been intensive development of cells based on the archetypal methylammonium (MA) and recently introduced formamidinium (FA) materials, however, there is still considerable controversy over their fundamental electronic properties. Two of the most important parameters are the binding energy of the exciton (R*) and its reduced effective mass \u03bc. Here we present extensive magneto optical studies of Cl assisted grown MAPbI3 as well as MAPbBr3 and the FA based materials FAPbI3 and FAPbBr3. We fit the excitonic states as a hydrogenic atom in magnetic field and the Landau levels for free carriers to give R* and \u03bc. The values of the exciton binding energy are in the range 14\u201325 meV in the low temperature phase and fall considerably \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 658, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8325707789864998739", "cites_id": ["8325707789864998739"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/ee/c5ee03435c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Uxeblh_binMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 33, "2017": 69, "2018": 92, "2019": 100, "2020": 106, "2021": 102, "2022": 108, "2023": 47}}
