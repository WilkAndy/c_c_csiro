One of the main challenges is to eliminate the presence of charge recombination centres throughout the film which have been observed to be most densely located at regions near the grain boundaries. Here, we introduce aluminium acetylacetonate to the perovskite precursor solution, which improves the crystal quality by reducing the microstrain in the polycrystalline film. At the same time, we achieve a reduction in the non-radiative recombination rate, a remarkable improvement in the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) and a reduction in the electronic disorder deduced from an Urbach energy of only 12.6 meV in complete devices \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 406, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12363179759327372292", "cites_id": ["12363179759327372292"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/ee/c6ee01969b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BOQB-XzWkqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 66, "2018": 62, "2019": 77, "2020": 67, "2021": 45, "2022": 63, "2023": 22}}
