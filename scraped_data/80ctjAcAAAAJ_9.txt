There are still a number of issues and open questions related to the perovskite material, such as the phenomenon of anomalous hysteresis in current\u2013voltage characteristics and long-term stability of the devices. In this work, we focus on the electron selective contact in the perovskite solar cells and physical processes occurring at that heterojunction. We developed efficient devices by replacing the commonly employed TiO2 compact layer with fullerene C60 in a regular n\u2013i\u2013p architecture. Detailed spectroscopic characterization allows us to present further insight into the nature of photocurrent hysteresis and charge extraction limitations arising at the n-type contact in a standard device. Furthermore, we show preliminary stability data of perovskite solar cells under working conditions, suggesting that an n-type organic charge \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "80ctjAcAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 370, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12416147927419822138", "cites_id": ["12416147927419822138"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00902", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OqCPpMEET6wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 10, "2016": 50, "2017": 65, "2018": 55, "2019": 51, "2020": 48, "2021": 42, "2022": 38, "2023": 11}}
