HIPASS is the deepest H i survey yet of the sky south of declination +2\u00b0, and is sensitive to emission out to 170 h75\u22121 Mpc. The characteristic root mean square noise in the survey images is 13.3 mJy. This paper describes the survey observations, which comprise 23 020 eight-degree scans of 9-min duration, and details the techniques used to calibrate and image the data. The processing algorithms are successfully designed to be statistically robust to the presence of interference signals, and are particular to imaging point (or nearly point) sources. Specifically, a major improvement in image quality is obtained by designing a median-gridding algorithm which uses the median estimator in place of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 671, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3975894338817924170", "cites_id": ["3975894338817924170"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/322/3/486/952500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Spy6AdY2LTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 15, "2002": 29, "2003": 28, "2004": 32, "2005": 33, "2006": 26, "2007": 28, "2008": 38, "2009": 40, "2010": 36, "2011": 32, "2012": 29, "2013": 24, "2014": 33, "2015": 32, "2016": 42, "2017": 22, "2018": 26, "2019": 26, "2020": 27, "2021": 23, "2022": 25, "2023": 15}}
