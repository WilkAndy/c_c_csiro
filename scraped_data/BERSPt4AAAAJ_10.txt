Our observations of a sample of H i selected galaxies in the light of H\u03b1 and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) challenge this result. The extinction-corrected flux ratio F H\u03b1/f FUV from these two tracers of star formation shows strong correlations with the surface brightness in H\u03b1 and the R band: low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have lower F H\u03b1/f FUV ratios compared to high surface brightness galaxies as well as compared to expectations from equilibrium models of constant star formation rate (SFR) using commonly favored IMF parameters. Weaker but significant correlations of F H\u03b1/f FUV with luminosity, rotational velocity, and dynamical mass as well as a systematic trend with morphology, are found. The correlated variations of F H\u03b1/f FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of galaxy scaling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 315, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4141499852059758539", "cites_id": ["4141499852059758539"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/695/1/765/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y89aPyyQeTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 13, "2010": 46, "2011": 55, "2012": 25, "2013": 28, "2014": 25, "2015": 15, "2016": 14, "2017": 15, "2018": 16, "2019": 17, "2020": 14, "2021": 16, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
