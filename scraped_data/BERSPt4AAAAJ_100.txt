In addition, we have developed a parallel framework called sofia-X that allows the processing of large data cubes to be split across multiple computing nodes. As a result of these efforts, sofia 2 is substantially faster and comes with a much reduced memory footprint compared to its predecessor, thus allowing the large WALLABY data volumes of hundreds of gigabytes of imaging data per epoch to be processed in real time. The source code has been made publicly available to the entire community under an open-source licence.
