Emission was found to extend 22.4 arcmin along the major axis and to be concentrated towards the nucleus with an LSR systemic velocity of 235km/s. The CO intensity and velocity distribution suggests three subsystems: a dense, highly-rotating nuclear cloud, a disk (with a line of nodes at a position angle of 63) extending 150arcsec each side of the nucleus containing a bar or spiral arms that are located at an azimuth of 21, and an outer disk with a position angle of 52. The total gas mass derived for the full extent is 2.4 x10^ 9^ M sun _, about 2% of the calculated dynamic mass of 10.5 x10^ 10^ M sun _."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15420468226976907939", "cites_id": ["15420468226976907939"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1997A%26A...325..923H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:owIouyaCANYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 6, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
