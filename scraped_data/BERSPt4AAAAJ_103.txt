Our galaxy sample spans four orders of magnitude in total H i mass and nine magnitudes in M B. We fit single and multiple component functions to each spectrum to isolate the cold, neutral medium given by a low-dispersion (< 6 km s\u2212 1) component of the spectrum. Most H i spectra are adequately fit by a single Gaussian with a dispersion of 8\u201312 km s\u2212 1. Cold H i is found in 23 of 27 (\u223c 85%) galaxies after a reduction of the sample size due to quality-control cuts. The cold H i contributes\u223c 20% of the total line-of-sight flux when found with warm H i.
