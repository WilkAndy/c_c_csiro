This galaxy is in close interaction with the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 1510 and possesses two prominent H\u2009i arms where extended ultraviolet complexes are found. Our data were taken using 2dF/AAOmega at the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope and are combined with the H\u2009i data from Local Volume H\u2009iSurvey and Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data. We detect ionized gas in 82\u2009per\u2009cent of the complexes, many of them located between 1 and 6.6 R25. We found significant differences between regions along the Arm 1 \u2013 8.25 \u2272 12+log(O/H) \u2272 8.45 \u2013, and knots located in the external debris of Arm 2, \u20138.40 \u2272 12+log(O/H) \u2272 8.60\u2013. Considering a radial and an azimuthal gradient following the H\u2009i arms, we confirm that Arm 2 has experienced an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:7H_MAutzIkAC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=853523498272670557", "cites_id": ["853523498272670557"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/450/4/3381/989702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XcP9eRlT2AsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
