Within a velocity search range of 300\u20133700 km s\u22121 and to a 3\u03c3 lower flux limit of \u223c40 mJy, 110 galaxies with H i emission were detected, one of which is previously uncatalogued. None of the detections has early-type morphology. Previously unknown velocities for 14 galaxies have been determined, with a further four velocity measurements being significantly dissimilar to published values. Identification of an optical counterpart is relatively unambiguous for more than \u223c90 per cent of our H i galaxies. The galaxies appear to be embedded in a sheet at the cluster velocity which extends for more than 30\u00b0 across the search area. At the nominal cluster distance of \u223c20 Mpc, this corresponds to an elongated structure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11323739876024749101", "cites_id": ["11323739876024749101"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/337/2/641/1025800", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LYxh52sBJp0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
