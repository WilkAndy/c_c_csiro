Compared to the conventional algorithms based on a chi-squared minimization procedure, this new Bayesian-based algorithm suffers less from local minima of the model parameters even with highly multimodal posterior distributions. Moreover, the Bayesian analysis, implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, only requires broad ranges of posterior distributions of the parameters, which makes the fitting procedure fully automated. This feature will be essential when performing kinematic analysis on the large number of resolved galaxies expected to be detected in neutral hydrogen (H\u2009i) surveys with the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders. The so-called 2D Bayesian Automated Tilted-ring fitter (2dbat) implements Bayesian fits of 2D tilted-ring models in order to derive rotation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10978043556500167644", "cites_id": ["10978043556500167644"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/473/3/3256/4209580", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Fv1UXPYWZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
