The group contains the prominent merging galaxy NGC 3256, which is surrounded by a number of H i fragments, the tidally disturbed galaxy NGC 3263, and several other peculiar galaxies. The Vela Cloud, with an H i mass of 3\u20135$\\times\\10^ 9\\,\\cal M_ {\\odot} $, resides southeast of NGC 3256 and west of NGC 3263, within an area of 9'\u00d7 16'(100 kpc\u00d7 175 kpc for an adopted distance of 38 Mpc). In our ATCA data the Vela Cloud appears as three diffuse components and contains four density enhancements. The Vela Cloud's properties, together with its group environment, suggest that it has a tidal origin. Each density enhancement contains  of H i gas, which is sufficient material for the formation of globular cluster progenitors.
