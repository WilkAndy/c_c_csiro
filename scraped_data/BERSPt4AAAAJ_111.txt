We measure an integrated H\u2009i flux density of \u2009Jy\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 emanating from this galaxy, which translates to an H\u2009i mass of  at an assumed distance of \u2009Mpc. Our observations show that NGC 1566 has an asymmetric and mildly warped H\u2009i disc. The H\u2009i-to-stellar mass fraction (M$_{\\rm{H\\,{{\\small I}}}}$/M\u2217) of NGC 1566 is 0.29, which is high in comparison with galaxies that have the same stellar mass (\u2009M\u2299). We also derive the rotation curve of this galaxy to a radius of \u2009kpc and fit different mass models to it. The NFW, Burkert, and pseudo-isothermal dark matter halo profiles fit the observed rotation curve reasonably well and recover dark matter fractions of 0.62, 0.58, and 0.66, respectively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1293062138194060964", "cites_id": ["1293062138194060964"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/487/2/2797/5499037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pGaQ6ynh8REJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
