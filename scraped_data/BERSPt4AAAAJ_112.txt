These observations were carried out at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). This observing programme is part of the 2MASS Tully\u2013Fisher (2MTF) survey. This project will combine H\u2009i widths from these GBT observations with those from further dedicated observing at the Parkes Telescope, from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array survey at Arecibo, and S/N > 10 and spectral resolution vres < 10 km\u2009s\u22121 published widths from a variety of telescopes. We will use these H\u2009i widths along with 2MASS photometry to estimate Tully\u2013Fisher distances to nearby spirals and investigate the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. In this paper, we report on detections of neutral hydrogen in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7902231562118169149", "cites_id": ["7902231562118169149"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/443/2/1044/1065843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PQLv6Lxdqm0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
