We achieve a 5\u03c3 H\u2009i column density sensitivity of 1019\u2009cm\u22122 over a spectral channel width of 8\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 for emission filling the 158 \u00d7 84\u2009arcsec synthesized beam. Our observations reveal for the first time the full extent of the H\u2009i disc of NGC 55 at this sensitivity and at a moderately high spatial resolution of about 1\u2009kpc. The H\u2009i disc of NGC 55 appears to be distorted on all scales. There is a strong east\u2013west asymmetry in the column density distribution along the major axis, suggesting that the disc is under the influence of ram-pressure forces. We also find evidence of streaming motions of the gas along the bar of NGC 55. The fitting of tilted rings to the velocity field reveals a strong warping of the outer gas disc which could be the result of tidal interaction with either NGC 300 or a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1506545150596581706", "cites_id": ["1506545150596581706"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/434/4/3511/964482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SollG9VS6BQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5}}
