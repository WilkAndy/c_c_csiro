The velocity gradient of the H i bridge provides a rough estimate for the time since the encounter of 500 Myr. For NGC 6221, the brightest and most massive galaxy of the group, we derive a dynamical mass of Mtot= 8 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299, while its companion NGC 6215 has a mass of only Mtot\u223c 2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299. Further, we find three low-surface-brightness dwarf galaxies (Dwarfs 1, 2 and 3) in the neighbourhood of NGC 6221/15 with H i masses of 3.3, 0.6 and 0.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299, respectively. The smallest, previously uncatalogued galaxy, Dwarf 3, lies between NGC 6221 and 6215, and may have formed out of bridge material.The brightest part of the H i \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5988768893226353697", "cites_id": ["5988768893226353697"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/348/4/1255/973319", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IYSqGpRhHFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
