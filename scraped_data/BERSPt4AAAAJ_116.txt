The analysis of the global HI distribution and the velocity field revealed new details in the kinematics of this peculiar galaxy. We find 1) the clear signature of a warp in the outer gas layer, and 2) outflow of neutral hydrogen gas from the nuclear region. The Warp has been deduced from the near-circular shape of the HI gas distribution ({angular size}~ 10'> optical size) which is in contrast to the ellipticity of the disk. Through atilted-ring model'fit we derive a warp angle of about i_w_= 23^ deg^. In the northeastern part of the disk, where prominent dust filaments seem to emerge from the nuclear region, we find a velocity anomaly which indicates outflow of HI gas into the halo of the galaxy. This means that we determined the flow direction of the dust filaments which have long \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4999482160240569885", "cites_id": ["4999482160240569885"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993A%26A...268...14K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ha4KTom6YUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
