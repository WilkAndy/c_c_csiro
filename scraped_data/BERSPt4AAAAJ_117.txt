The objects appear in radio images as circular edge-brightened discs, about one arcmin diameter, that are unlike other objects previously reported in the literature. We explore several possible mechanisms that might cause these objects, but none seems to be a compelling explanation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:2vr6o8x5NLkC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16141518583475655929", "cites_id": ["16141518583475655929"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/unexpected-circular-radio-objects-at-high-galactic-latitude/4346B9FAADAA764CB6B122FBBF5B1E56", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-dRuV6ExAuAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 12, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
