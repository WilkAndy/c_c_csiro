With roughly half-solar abundances, M\u200933 is a first step towards young low-metallicity galaxies where the submm may be able to provide an alternative to CO mapping to measure their H2 content. In this Letter, we measure the dust emission cross-section \u03c3 using SPIRE and recent CO and H i observations; a variation in \u03c3 is present from a near-solar neighborhood cross-section to about half-solar with the maximum being south of the nucleus. Calculating the total H column density from the measured dust temperature and cross-section, and then subtracting the H i column, yields a morphology similar to that observed in CO. The H2/H i mass ratio decreases from about unity to well below 10% and is about 15% averaged over the optical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3598289249180909803", "cites_id": ["3598289249180909803"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2010/10/aa14551-10/aa14551-10.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6wCJ8AGx7zEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
