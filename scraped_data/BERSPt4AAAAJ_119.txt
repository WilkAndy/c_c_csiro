Here we present the catalogue of H\u2009i sources. The H\u2009i data were obtained with the four-beam receiver mounted on the 76.2-m Lovell telescope [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) 12 arcmin] at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (UK) as part of the H\u2009i Jodrell All Sky Survey (HIJASS). We use the automated source finder duchamp and identify 166 H\u2009i sources in the data cubes with H\u2009i masses in the range of 107\u20131010.5 M\u2299. Our Ursa Major H\u2009i catalogue includes 10 first-time detections in the 21-cm emission line.We identify optical counterparts for 165 H\u2009i sources (99 per\u2009cent). For 54 H\u2009i sources (\u223c33 per\u2009cent) we find numerous optical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15089816943954023212", "cites_id": ["15089816943954023212"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/428/2/1790/1010487", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LNMMro_MadEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
