This sample spans nearly 4 orders of magnitude in H I mass [log (M H I/M\u2299)+ 2 log h 75= 6.8\u201310.6] and is the largest sample of H I\u2013selected galaxies to date. We develop a bivariate maximum likelihood technique to measure the space density of galaxies and show that this is a robust method, insensitive to the effects of large-scale structure. The resulting H I mass function can be fitted satisfactorily with a Schechter function with faint-end slope \u03b1=-1.30. This slope is found to be dependent on morphological type, with late-type galaxies giving steeper slopes. We extensively test various effects that potentially bias the determination of the H I mass function, including peculiar motions of galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC", "num_citations": 270, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15270402754457752355", "cites_id": ["15270402754457752355"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/374944/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I9OZLGZe69MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 5, "2004": 28, "2005": 29, "2006": 16, "2007": 15, "2008": 19, "2009": 11, "2010": 15, "2011": 10, "2012": 15, "2013": 13, "2014": 13, "2015": 19, "2016": 15, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
