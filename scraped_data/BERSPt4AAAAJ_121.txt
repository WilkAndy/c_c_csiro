These observations were conducted as part of the Wide-field ASKAP L-Band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) Early Science program with an array of 12 ASKAP antennas equipped with Phased Array Feeds, which were used to form 36 beams to map a field of view of 30 deg2. Analysing a subregion of the central beams, we detect 17 H\u2009i sources. Eleven of these detections are identified as galaxies and have stellar counterparts, of which five are newly resolved H\u2009i galaxy sources. The other six detections appear to be tidal debris in the form of H\u2009i clouds that are associated with the central triplet, NGC 7232/3, comprising the spiral galaxies NGC 7232, NGC 7232B, and NGC 7233. One of these H\u2009i clouds has a mass of MH\u2009i \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 and could be the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2865676692002051939", "cites_id": ["2865676692002051939"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/487/4/5248/5274136", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yxfms8TtxCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
