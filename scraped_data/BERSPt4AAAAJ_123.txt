The WISE TF relation is formed from 568 galaxies taken from the all-sky 2MASS Tully\u2013Fisher (2MTF) galaxy catalog, spanning a range of environments including field, group, and cluster galaxies. This constitutes the largest mid-infrared TF relation constructed to date. After applying a number of corrections to galaxy magnitudes and line widths, we measure a master TF relation given by M corr=\u2212 22.24\u2212 10.05 [log (W corr)\u2212 2.5], with an average dispersion of \u03c3 WISE= 0.686 mag. There is some tension between WISE TF and a preliminary 3.6 \u03bcm relation, which has a shallower slope and almost no intrinsic dispersion. However, our results agree well with a more recent relation constructed from a large sample of cluster galaxies. We additionally compare WISE TF to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11918237465904238025", "cites_id": ["11918237465904238025"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/771/2/88/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yU35Z9QVZqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
