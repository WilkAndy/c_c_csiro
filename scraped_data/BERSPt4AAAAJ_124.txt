Combining the results with those of four other well-studied dwarf galaxies known for their unusually large HI contents, we identified an upper envelope for the Script M/L B as a function of galaxy luminosity. This implies an empirical relation between the minimum amount of stars a galaxy will form and its initial baryonic mass. We also find that the star density systematically decreases with increasing Script M/L B, making the galaxies optically more elusive. While the stellar mass of a galaxy seems to be only loosely connected to its baryonic mass, the latter quantity is strongly linked to the galaxy's dynamical mass as it is observed in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We find that dwarf irregular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15442241979448288738", "cites_id": ["15442241979448288738"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/521925/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4uWjiEPdTdYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
