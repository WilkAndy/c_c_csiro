There is accumulating evidence that such H\u2009i-deficient galaxies are also relatively frequent in galaxy groups. An important question is that which mechanisms are responsible for the gas deficiency in galaxy groups. To gain a better understanding of how environment affects the gas content of galaxies, we identified a sample of six H\u2009i-deficient galaxies from the H\u2009i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) using H\u2009i-optical scaling relations. One of the galaxies is located in the outskirts of the Fornax cluster, four are in loose galaxy groups and one is in a galaxy triplet. We present new high-resolution H\u2009i observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) of these galaxies. We discuss the possible cause of H\u2009i-deficiency in the sample based \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2055062345188049166", "cites_id": ["2055062345188049166"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/455/2/1294/1113632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DgE3lFAMhRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
