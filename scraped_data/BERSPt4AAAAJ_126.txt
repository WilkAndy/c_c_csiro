None of the candidates is detected in H\u2009i, implying upper limits for their H\u2009i masses of typically several hundred to a few thousand solar masses. The resulting upper limits on $M_{\\rm H\\small {I}} / L_{\\rm V}$ and $M_{\\rm H\\small {I}} / M_{\\star }$ suggest that at least some of the new galaxy candidates are H\u2009i deficient. This finding is consistent with the general H\u2009i deficiency of satellite galaxies located within the Milky Way's virial radius and supports the hypothesis that gas is being removed from satellites by tidal and ram-pressure forces during perigalactic passages. In addition, some of the objects may be embedded in, and interacting with, the extended neutral and ionized gas filaments of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7038815904412800039", "cites_id": ["7038815904412800039"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/453/1/338/1749215", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JxTllcXlrmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 10, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
