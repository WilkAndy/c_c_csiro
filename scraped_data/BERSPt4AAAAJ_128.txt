A comparison with published O vi/Ca ii absorption and H i emission-line measurements suggests that the HVCs are condensations within an extended and mainly ionized component of the Magellanic Stream. They coincide in position with a faint gas stream predicted in numerical simulations of the Magellanic Clouds by Gardiner & Noguchi. Consequently, the Magellanic Stream could be much more extended than generally believed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17722884844456577137", "cites_id": ["17722884844456577137"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/388/1/L29/978023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cQj9vN1V9PUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
