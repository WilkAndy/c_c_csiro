We also select a sub-sample of 10 large galaxies for investigating properties in the galactic outskirts. The LVHIS sample covers nearly four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and two orders of magnitude in H\u2009i mass fraction ($f_{\\rm {H\\,\\small {I}}}$). The radial distribution of H\u2009i gas with respect to the stellar disc is correlated with $f_{\\rm {H\\,\\small {I}}}$ but with a large scatter. We confirm the previously found correlations between the total H\u2009i mass and star formation rate (SFR), and between H\u2009i surface densities and SFR surface densities beyond R25. However, the former correlation becomes much weaker when the average surface densities rather than total mass or rate are considered, and the latter correlation also becomes much weaker when the effect of stellar mass is removed or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7942787875028345311", "cites_id": ["7942787875028345311"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/472/3/3029/4082227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3yFYWX1zOm4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
