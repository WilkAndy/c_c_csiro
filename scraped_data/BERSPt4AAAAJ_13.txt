Of the 4315 H i radio-detected sources from the H i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) catalogue, we find optical counterparts for 3618 (84 per cent) galaxies. Of these, 1798 (42 per cent) have confirmed optical velocities and 848 (20 per cent) are single matches without confirmed velocities. Some galaxy matches are members of galaxy groups. From these multiple galaxy matches, 714 (16 per cent) have confirmed optical velocities and a further 258 (6 per cent) galaxies are without confirmed velocities. For 481 (11 per cent), multiple galaxies are present but no single optical counterpart can be chosen and 216 (5 per cent) have no obvious optical galaxy present. Most of these \u2018blank fields\u2019 are in crowded fields along the Galactic plane or have high extinctions.Isolated \u2018dark galaxy\u2019 candidates are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 244, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10688502426624647711", "cites_id": ["10688502426624647711"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/361/1/34/1023569", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H-Lcr1MwVZQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 17, "2007": 11, "2008": 14, "2009": 15, "2010": 12, "2011": 16, "2012": 14, "2013": 19, "2014": 15, "2015": 14, "2016": 18, "2017": 19, "2018": 16, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
