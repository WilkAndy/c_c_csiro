We model the H\u2009i kinematics with the Tilted Ring Fitting Code TiRiFiC and compare the observed H\u2009ix galaxies to a control sample of galaxies from Hipass as well as simulated galaxies built with the semi-analytic model Dark Sage. We find that (1) H\u2009i discs in H\u2009ix galaxies are more likely to be warped and more likely to host H\u2009i arms and tails than in the control galaxies, (2) the average H\u2009i and average stellar column density of H\u2009ix galaxies is comparable to the control sample, (3) H\u2009ix galaxies have higher H\u2009i and baryonic specific angular momenta than control galaxies, (4) most H\u2009ix galaxies live in higher spin haloes than most control \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12776199348628328841", "cites_id": ["12776199348628328841"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/476/3/3744/4867981", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iZGRyp0tTrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
