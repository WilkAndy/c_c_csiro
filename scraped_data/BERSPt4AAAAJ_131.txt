To achieve this, we obtained high-resolution Spitzer mid-infrared images with the IRAC (3.6, 5.8, 4.5 and 8.0\u2009\u03bcm) and MIPS (24 and 70\u2009\u03bcm) instruments and sensitive H\u2009i data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the 64-m Parkes telescope. These were supplemented by CO maps from the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope. Because Circinus is hidden behind the Galactic plane, we demonstrate the careful removal of foreground stars as well as large- and small-scale Galactic emission from the Spitzer images. We derive a visual extinction of AV = 2.1\u2009mag from the spectral energy distribution of the Circinus galaxy and total stellar and gas masses of 9.5 \u00d7 1010 and 9 \u00d7 109\u2009M\u2299, respectively. Using various wavelength calibrations, we find obscured \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10146918716592620763", "cites_id": ["10146918716592620763"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/425/3/1934/981093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2wRE488Y0YwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
