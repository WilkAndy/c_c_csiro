For each galaxy we measure the disc parameters (inclination, position angle) and the H\u2003i rotation curve. Six galaxies in our sample (AM\u20030605\u2212341, Argo Dwarf, ESO\u2003059\u2212G001, ESO\u2003137\u2212G018, ESO\u2003174\u2212G?001 and ESO\u2003308\u2212G022) have their atomic hydrogen distribution studied for the first time. AM\u20030605\u2212341 was found to have an extension of redshifted H\u2003i which we propose is due to a tidal interaction with NGC\u20032188. There is evidence that ESO\u2003215\u2212G?009 has extraplanar H\u2003i gas. We also compare the global galaxy properties, in particular the integrated H\u2003i flux density and velocity widths of the observed H\u2003i spectra, with the results from the low angular resolution H\u2003i Parkes All Sky \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11452463626251826113", "cites_id": ["11452463626251826113"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/420/4/2924/972005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wXPShf1S754J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
