This Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) survey finds new H i galaxies which lie hidden behind the Milky Way, and also provides redshifts for partially obscured galaxies known at other wavelengths. Before the commencement of the full survey, two low-latitude precursor regions were observed, totaling 138 deg 2, with 72 H i galaxies detected. Detections through the inner Galaxy generally have no cataloged counterparts in any other waveband, due to the heavy extinction and stellar confusion. Detections through the outer Galaxy are more likely to have Two Micron All Sky Survey counterparts. We present the results of these precursor observations, including a catalog of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14772051309246419161", "cites_id": ["14772051309246419161"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/139/6/2130/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2RB6a2beAM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
