Five stars were detected; three of them have negative spectral indices, consistent with non-thermal emission, and two have positive indices. The thermal radiation from HD 150135 and HD 163181 can be explained as coming from an optically thick ionized stellar wind. The non-thermal radiation from CD-47\u00b0 4551, HD 124314 and HD 150136 possibly comes from strong shocks in the wind itself and/or in the wind colliding region if the stars have a massive early-type companion. The percentage of non-thermal emitters among detected O stars has increased up to ~50% . The Of star HD 124314 clearly shows flux density variations. Mass loss rates (or upper limits) were derived for all the observed stars and the results compared with non-radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3354438140041122494,16165781191066802002", "cites_id": ["3354438140041122494", "16165781191066802002"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2001/24/aa1213/aa1213.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vlIsPrdbjS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
