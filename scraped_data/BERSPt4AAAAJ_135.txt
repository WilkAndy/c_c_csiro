We find strong evidence for a nuclear ring about 20\" in diameter, with a circular velocity V_max_= 110 km/s, which is possibly responsible for the gas supply to the nuclear starburst region of the galaxy. The analysis of the dynamics of the bar in NGC 253 indicates that the nuclear ring is related to the presence of an inner Lindblad resonance at~ 300 pc. In this framework, the observed velocities indicate a mass in the central 10\" of 3 X 10^ 8^ M_sun_. Good agreement is obtained between the new optical data and published HI rotation curves at larger radii."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7331670058512890409", "cites_id": ["7331670058512890409"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995AJ....110..199A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KToHyBJTv2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
