The ATCA H i mosaic of Circinus exhibits the warps in position angle and inclination revealed in the single-pointing image of Jones et al., both of which appear to settle beyond the inner 30 kpc which was previously imaged. The molecular gas has been mapped in both the CO J= 1\u2192 0 and J= 2\u2192 1 transitions down to a column density of (3\u03c3), where we derive a total molecular gas mass of. Within a radius of 3 kpc, ie where CO was clearly detected, the molecular fraction climbs steeply from\u2248 0.7 to unity (where, cf. NH i= 1021cm\u2212 2) with proximity to the nucleus. Our H i mosaic gives an atomic gas mass of MH i\u2248 6\u00d7 109M\u2299, which is 70 per cent of the fully mapped single dish value.
