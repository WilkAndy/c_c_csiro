This catalog is based on data from the H I Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) reprocessed with the MINMED5 procedure and searched with a new high-velocity cloud-finding algorithm. The improved sensitivity (5 \u03c3: \u0394 T B= 0.04 K), resolution (15 &farcm; 5), and velocity range (-500 km s-1< V LSR<+ 500 km s-1) of the HIPASS data result in a substantial increase in the number of individual clouds (1956, as well as 41 galaxies) compared with what was known from earlier southern data. The method of cataloging the anomalous-velocity objects is described, and a catalog of key cloud parameters, including velocity, angular size, peak column density, total flux, position angle, and degree of isolation, is presented. The data are characterized into several classes of anomalous-velocity H I emission. Most high-velocity emission features are HVCs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 229, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11596000637708430298", "cites_id": ["11596000637708430298"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/338088/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2mvQSSRF7aAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 14, "2003": 18, "2004": 27, "2005": 15, "2006": 12, "2007": 8, "2008": 18, "2009": 12, "2010": 14, "2011": 8, "2012": 16, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 13, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
