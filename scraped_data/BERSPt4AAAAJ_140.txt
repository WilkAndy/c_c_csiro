The relative proximity of NGC 253 makes it a very suitable object for detailed studies of large-scale, as well as nuclear, gas dynamics. Several peculiar features have been found. The HI distribution is asymmetric in the outer regions, probably as a result of the strong warping of the spiral arms. A bar associated with the disc, clearly visible in the optical and near-infrared, also reveals its signature in the neutral hydrogen gas. HI absorption measurements reveal unusual motions of the gas in the nuclear region which seem to indicate a fast-rotating ring of cold gas as well as outflow of gas. Similar features have been found in other starburst galaxies, such as M 82, NGC 1808 and NGC 4945, and are interpreted in terms of bar-induced gas dynamics and star \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14199607811303494031", "cites_id": ["14199607811303494031"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/peculiar-gas-dynamics-in-the-starburst-galaxy-ngc-253/11CA39C0FC16214709D16B8CF44444F2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j1GbVhIkD8UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
