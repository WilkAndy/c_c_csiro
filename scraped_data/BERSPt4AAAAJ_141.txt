We present the projected phase\u2013space distribution of H i-detected galaxies in Hydra, and identify that nearly two-thirds of the galaxies within  may be in the early stages of ram pressure stripping. More than half of these may be only weakly stripped, with the ratio of strippable H i (ie, where the galactic restoring force is lower than the ram pressure in the disk) mass fraction (over total H i mass) distributed uniformly below 90%. Consequently, the H i mass is expected to decrease by only a few 0.1 dex after the currently strippable portion of H i in these systems has been stripped. A more detailed look at the subset of galaxies that are spatially resolved by WALLABY observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:PQEM9vzQD9gC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1078425966156364047", "cites_id": ["1078425966156364047"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfc52/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D7lO1bNW9w4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 17, "2023": 11}}
