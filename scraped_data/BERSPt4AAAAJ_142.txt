The ASKAP H\u2009i spectrum shows a maximum negative radial velocity (with respect to the local standard of rest) of \u221231 \u00b1 4\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 for MAXI J1348\u2013630, as compared to \u221250 \u00b1 4\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 for a stacked spectrum of several nearby extragalactic sources. This implies a most probable distance of \u2009kpc for MAXI J1348\u2013630, and a strong upper limit of the tangent point distance at 5.3 \u00b1 0.1\u2009kpc. Our preferred distance implies that MAXI J1348\u2013630 reached 17 \u00b1 10\u2009 per cent of the Eddington luminosity at the peak of its outburst, and that the source transited from the soft to the hard X-ray spectral state at 2.5 \u00b1 1.5\u2009 per cent of the Eddington luminosity.
