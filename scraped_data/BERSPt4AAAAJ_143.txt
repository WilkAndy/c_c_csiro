We have searched for H\u2009i absorption towards 1253 radio sources in the GAMA\u200923 field, covering redshifts between z = 0.34 and 0.79 over a sky area of approximately 50\u2009deg2. In a purely blind search, we did not obtain any detections of 21-cm absorbers above our reliability threshold. Assuming a fiducial value for the H\u2009i spin temperature of Tspin = 100\u2009K and source covering fraction cf = 1, the total comoving absorption path-length sensitive to all Damped Lyman\u2009\u03b1 Absorbers (DLAs; NH\u2009i \u2265 2 \u00d7 1020\u2009cm\u22122) is \u0394X = 6.6 \u00b1 0.3 (\u0394z = 3.7 \u00b1 0.2) and super-DLAs (NH\u2009i \u2265 2 \u00d7 1021\u2009cm\u22122) is \u0394X = 111 \u00b1 6 (\u0394z= 63 \u00b1 3).
