This dwarf galaxy is situated at a distance of \u223c100 Mpc and contains an unresolved region of H\u2009ii emission that contributes \u223c70\u2009per\u2009cent of the galaxy's H\u03b1 luminosity, located at the top end of established H\u2009ii region luminosity functions. For the H\u2009ii complex, we measure a star formation rate of 0.147 \u00b1 0.041 M\u2299 yr\u22121and a metallicity of 12+log(O/H) = 8.01 \u00b1 0.05 that is lower than the rest of the galaxy by \u223c0.2 dex. Data from the H\u2009i Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) indicate the likely presence of neutral hydrogen in the galaxy to potentially fuel ongoing and future star-forming events. We discuss various triggering mechanisms for the intense star formation activity of this H\u2009ii complex \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13851709123232680103", "cites_id": ["13851709123232680103"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/445/2/1104/1401501", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p0hS3g4oO8AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
