It was found during the course of a systematic H i survey of the southern Zone of Avoidance (ZOA)(| b|\u2264 5\u00b0) with the multibeam system at the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. Follow-up observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array reveal an extended H i disc. We derive an H i mass of 7.5\u00d7 1010 M\u2299. Using the H i radius, we estimate a total dynamical mass of 1.4\u00d7 1012 M\u2299, similar to the most massive known disc galaxies such as Malin 1. HIZOA J0836\u2212 43 lies deep in the ZOA where the optical extinction is very high, AB= 9.8 mag. However, in the near-infrared (NIR) wavebands, where the extinction is considerably lower, HIZOA J0836\u2212 43 is clearly detected by both the Deep Near Infrared Survey of the Southern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16057131702604623301", "cites_id": ["16057131702604623301"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/369/4/1741/1090318", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xW1pjTVk1t4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
