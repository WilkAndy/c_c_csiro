We find that most of the original estimates for Script M/L B based on available photographic magnitudes in the literature were too high and conclude that genuine high HI mass-to-light ratio (> 5 Script M\u2299/L\u2299, B) galaxies are rare in the local universe. Extreme high-Script M/L B galaxies such as ESO 215-G? 009 appear to have formed only the minimum number of stars necessary to maintain the stability of their HI disks and could possibly be used to constrain galaxy formation models. They may also have been forming stars at a low, constant rate over their lifetimes. The best examples all have highly extended HI disks, are spatially isolated, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6540381777453286227", "cites_id": ["6540381777453286227"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/500589/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U4OK_JIaxFoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
