IC\u20095201 is a blue, barred spiral galaxy that follows the known scaling relations between stellar mass, SFR, H\u2009i mass, and diameter. We create a four-beam mosaicked H\u2009i image cube from 175 h of observations made with a 12-antenna sub-array. The root mean square noise level of the cube is 1.7 mJy beam\u22121 per channel, equivalent to a column density of $N_{\\rm H\\, \\small {I}}$  = 1.4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 over 25 km\u2009s\u22121. We report nine extragalactic H\u2009i detections \u2013 five new H\u2009i detections including the first velocity measurements for two galaxies. These sources are IC\u20095201, three dwarf satellite galaxies, two galaxies, and a tidal feature belonging to the NGC\u20097232/3 triplet and two potential infalling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:hvmnpdAuIbkC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8306493485217282588", "cites_id": ["8306493485217282588"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/488/4/5352/5539551", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HPp4q9CXRnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
