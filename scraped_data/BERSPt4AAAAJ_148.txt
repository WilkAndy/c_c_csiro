This follows the six HIPASS galaxies searched in previous work and completes our full sample. In this paper, we searched for absorption along 17 sightlines with impact parameters between 6 and 46 kpc, making one new detection. We also obtained simultaneous H\u2009i emission-line data, allowing us to directly relate the absorption-line detection rate to the H\u2009i distribution. From this, we find the majority of the non-detections in the current sample are because sightline does not intersect the H\u2009i disc of the galaxy at sufficiently high column density, but that source structure is also an important factor. The detected absorption-line arises in the galaxy NGC 5156 (z = 0.01) at an impact parameter of 19 kpc. The line is deep and narrow with an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8633864336969956479", "cites_id": ["8633864336969956479"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/457/3/2613/2588885", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f_wBzN6l0XcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
