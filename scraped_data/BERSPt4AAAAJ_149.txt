This interaction results in numerous neutral and ionized gas structures that have been found both in the disc and in the halo of these galaxies. However, their origin and fate are still poorly understood.We here present new H i and optical data of two Magellanic irregular dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume: IC 4662 and NGC 5408. The H i line data were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and are part of the \u2018Local Volume H i Survey\u2019. They are complemented by optical images and spectroscopic data obtained with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) New Technology Telescope and the ESO 3.6-m telescope. Our main aim is to study the kinematics of the neutral and ionized gas components in order to search for outflowing gas structures and to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9446581364902012510", "cites_id": ["9446581364902012510"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/407/1/113/984299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XibPhLP_GIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
