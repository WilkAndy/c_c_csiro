This extension adds the sky area between the declination (Dec.) range of +2\u00b0 < \u03b4 < +25\u00b030\u2032 to HICAT's Dec. range of \u221290\u00b0 < \u03b4 < +2\u00b0. HIPASS is a blind H i survey using the Parkes Radio Telescope covering 71 per cent of the sky (including this northern extension) and a heliocentric velocity range of \u22121280 to 12 700 km s\u22121. The entire Virgo Cluster region has been observed in the Northern HIPASS. The galaxy catalogue, NHICAT, contains 1002 sources with vhel > 300 km s\u22121. Sources with \u2212300 < vhel < 300 km s\u22121 were excluded to avoid contamination by Galactic emission. In total, the entire HIPASS survey has found 5317 galaxies identified purely by their HI content. The full galaxy catalogue is publicly available at http://hipass.aus-vo.org."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 226, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12013648370394629049", "cites_id": ["12013648370394629049"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/371/4/1855/1059642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uYPStYoNuaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 14, "2008": 22, "2009": 11, "2010": 20, "2011": 16, "2012": 10, "2013": 14, "2014": 19, "2015": 13, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 18, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
