The survey has a spatial and velocity resolution of 67\u2033 \u00d7 95\u2033(\u223c6\u2005\u00d7\u20059 kpc at the Fornax cluster distance of 20 Mpc) and 6.6 km s\u22121 and a 3\u03c3 sensitivity of NHI \u223c 2 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 and MHI \u223c 2 \u00d7 107\u2006M\u2299, respectively. We detect 16 galaxies out of roughly 200 spectroscopically confirmed Fornax cluster members. The detections cover about three orders of magnitude in HI mass, from 8\u2005\u00d7\u2005106 to 1.5\u2005\u00d7\u20051010\u2006M\u2299. They avoid the central, virialised region of the cluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing that they are recent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, \u223c2 Gyr. Half of these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several cases of asymmetries, tails, offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3611654372779606591", "cites_id": ["3611654372779606591"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2021/04/aa39803-20/aa39803-20.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P8IDRYQsHzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 17, "2023": 10}}
