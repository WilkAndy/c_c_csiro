To answer this, we need to be able to estimate the H2 mass. Traditionally, this is done using CO observations and a few assumptions but the Herschel observations which cover the far-IR dust spectrum make it possible to estimate the molecular gas mass independently of CO and thus to investigate whether and how the CO traces H2. Previous attempts to derive gas masses from dust emission suffered from biases. Generally, dust surface densities, H\u2009i column densities, and CO intensities are used to derive a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) and the local CO intensity to H2 column density ratio (XCO), sometimes allowing for an additional CO-dark gas component (Kdark). We tested earlier methods, revealing degeneracies among the parameters, and then used a sophisticated Bayesian formalism to derive the most likely values for each of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12408079504689512004", "cites_id": ["12408079504689512004"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2017/04/aa29300-16/aa29300-16.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RL7SlZFaMqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
