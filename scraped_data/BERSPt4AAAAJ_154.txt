Using the 64-m Parkes radio telescope multibeam system we obtain 152 high signal-to-noise ratio H i spectra from which we extract 148 high-accuracy (<5 per cent error) velocity widths and derive reliable rotation velocities. The observed sample consists of 303 southern (\u03b4 < \u221240\u00b0) galaxies selected from the 2MASS Redshift Survey with Ks < 11.25 mag, cz < 10\u2009000 km s\u22121 and axis ratio b/a < 0.5. The H i observations reported in this paper will be combined with new H i spectra from the Green Bank and Arecibo telescopes, together producing the most uniform Tully\u2013Fisher survey ever constructed (in terms of sky coverage). In particular, due to its near-infrared selection, 2MTF will be significantly more complete at low Galactic latitude (|b| < 15\u00b0) and will provide a more reliable map of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17735068238801946884", "cites_id": ["17735068238801946884"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/432/2/1178/1026127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BEkaSZmeH_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
