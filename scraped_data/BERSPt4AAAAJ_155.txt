All three proplyd-like objects are clearly resolved with an extent of a few arcseconds. The integrated 6 cm fluxes are up to 1.3 times higher than the 3 cm fluxes with spectral indices averaged over the whole clump between \u03b1=-0.1 and-0.5 (S \u03bd\u221d \u03bd \u03b1), indicating the likely presence of nonthermal emission in at least some of the sources. We present spectral-index maps and show that the sites of negative radio spectral indices are predominantly concentrated in the direction of the tails in at least two of the three proplyd-like nebulae, while positive spectral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12712060191757152163", "cites_id": ["12712060191757152163"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/339843/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o68RnWRParAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
