The projected separation of the X-ray peaks of the two clusters is ~50\u2032 or ~3.1 Mpc. Here we present an inventory of interesting radio sources in this field around this cluster merger. While the eROSITA observations provide clear indications of a bridge of thermal gas between the clusters, neither ASKAP nor MWA observations show any diffuse radio emission coinciding with the X-ray bridge. We derive an upper limit on the radio emissivity in the bridge region of . A non-detection of diffuse radio emission in the X-ray bridge between these two clusters has implications for particle-acceleration mechanisms in cosmological large-scale structure. We also report extended or otherwise noteworthy radio sources in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1396911924274495583", "cites_id": ["1396911924274495583"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2021/03/aa39533-20/aa39533-20.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X4DjdP7TYhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
