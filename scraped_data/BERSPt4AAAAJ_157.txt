The final 2MTF catalogue contains 2062 nearby spiral galaxies in the CMB frame velocity range of 600 < cz < 10\u2009000\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 with a mean velocity of 4805\u2009km\u2009s\u22121. The main update in this release is the replacement of some archival HI data with newer ALFALFA data. Using the 2MTF template relation, we calculate the distances and peculiar velocities of all 2MTF galaxies. The mean uncertainties of the linear distance measurements are around 22 per\u2009 cent in all three infrared bands. 2MTF measurements agree well with the distances from the Cosmicflows-3 compilation, which contains 1117 common galaxies, including 28 with SNIa distance measurements. Using distances estimated from the \u20183-bands combined\u2019 2MTF sample and a \u03c72 minimization method, we find best-fitting bulk flow amplitudes of 308 \u00b1 26\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6541825782386182520", "cites_id": ["6541825782386182520"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/487/2/2061/5497933", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eMmeleM7yVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 7}}
