We detected the system at 4.8 GHz (6 cm) with a flux density of mJy and set an upper limit of 0.3 mJy at 8.64 GHz (3 cm). The derived spectral index of () suggests the presence of non-thermal emission, probably originating in a colliding-wind region. A second, unrelated radio source was detected ~ north of WR 21a\u2000at (RA, Dec), with flux densities of 0.36 and 0.55 mJy at 4.8 and 8.64 GHz, respectively, resulting in . H\u2009i observations in the area are dominated by absorption against the prominent H\u2009ii region RCW 49. Analysis of a complete set of archived X-ray observations of WR 21a\u2000confirms its strong variability but throws into doubt previous suggestions by Reig (1999) of a period of years for the system.
