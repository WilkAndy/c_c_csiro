We detected a large H i cloud between IC 2554 and the elliptical galaxy NGC 3136B. The gas dynamics in IC 2554 itself, which is sometimes described as a colliding pair, are surprisingly regular, whereas NGC 3136B was not detected. The H i cloud, which emerges from IC 2554 as a large arc-shaped plume, has a size of \u223c30 kpc, larger than that of IC 2554. The total H i mass of the IC 2554 system is \u223c2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299, one-third of which resides in the H i cloud. It is possible that tidal interaction between IC 2554 and NGC 3136B caused this spectacular H i cloud, but the possibility of IC 2554 being a merger remnant is also discussed. We also detected H i gas in the nearby galaxies ESO 092-G009 and RKK 1959 and an associated H i cloud, ATCA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9503088669715292289", "cites_id": ["9503088669715292289"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/339/4/1203/1007812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gWBrq8vA4YMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
