The survey consists of H\u03b1 and R-band imaging of a sample of 468 galaxies selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). The sample spans three decades in HI mass and is free of many of the biases that affect other star-forming galaxy samples. We present the criteria for sample selection, list the entire sample, discuss our observational techniques, and describe the data reduction and calibration methods. This paper focuses on 93 SINGG targets whose observations have been fully reduced and analyzed to date. The majority of these show a single emission line galaxy (ELG). We see multiple ELGs in 13 fields, with up to four ELGs in a single field. All of the targets in this sample are detected in H\u03b1, indicating that dormant (non-star-forming) galaxies with M\u2273 3\u00d7 10 7 M\u2609 are very rare.
