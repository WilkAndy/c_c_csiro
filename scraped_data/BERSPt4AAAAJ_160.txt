The surveyed region covers| b|\u2264 5 in the zone of avoidance (ZOA) from Galactic longitude 308 to 332. The survey represents the first phase of a blind H I survey covering the southern ZOA (l= 212 to 36). We have detected H I in 42 galaxies above a 3 \u03c3 limit of 60 mJy. The galaxies detected in this survey have velocities out to 6000 km s-1 and H I masses in the range 4\u00d7 10 7 to 3\u00d7 10 10 M\u2299(h). Only eight of the 42 galaxies have velocities previously measured. A further nine galaxies appear to have optical counterparts in the Woudt's 1998 catalog. In total, 16 of the galaxies appear to be associated with IRAS sources, although only three of these are without optical counterparts. The estimated median extinction for the 20 galaxies with optical or IR counterparts is A B= 3.8 mag.
