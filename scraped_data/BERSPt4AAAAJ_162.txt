The 13 HIX galaxies have been selected to host the most massive H\u2009i discs at a given stellar luminosity. We compare these galaxies to a control sample of average galaxies detected in the H\u2009i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). As the control sample is matched in stellar luminosity, we find that the stellar properties of HIX galaxies are similar to the control sample. Furthermore, the specific star formation rate and optical morphology do not differ between HIX and control galaxies. We find, however, the HIX galaxies to be less efficient in forming stars. For the most H\u2009i massive galaxy in our sample (ESO075-G006, log $M_{\\rm H\\,\\small {I}}$ [M\u2299] = (10.8 \u00b1 0.1)), the kinematic properties are the reason for inefficient star formation and H\u2009i excess.
