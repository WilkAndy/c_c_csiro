We measure the total H\u2009i mass present in the environment in a statistical way by studying the distribution of noise peaks in the H\u2009i data cubes obtained for 40 galaxies observed with Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We find that galaxies whose H\u2009i mass fraction is high relative to standard scaling relations have an excess H\u2009i mass in the surrounding environment as well. Gas in the environment consists of gas clumps which are individually below the detection limit of our H\u2009i data. These clumps may be hosted by small satellite galaxies and/or be the high-density peaks of a more diffuse gas distribution in the intergalactic medium. We interpret this result as an indication for a picture in which the ${\\rm H}\\,{\\small {I}}$-rich \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1280720689292835178", "cites_id": ["1280720689292835178"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/453/3/2399/1078602", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:avnKba4IxhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
