Its \u2018C\u2019-shaped morphology and tidal plume indicate a recent strong interaction with its companion which was identified with these observations. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that the main properties of the system can be generated by a high-speed off-axis drop-through collision of a small galaxy with a larger disc system, thus making NGC 922 one of the nearest known collisional ring galaxies. While these systems are rare in the local Universe, recent deep Hubble Space Telescope images suggest they were more common in the early Universe."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13266425505935547148", "cites_id": ["13266425505935547148"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/370/4/1607/1023516", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DFt4iLXPG7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
