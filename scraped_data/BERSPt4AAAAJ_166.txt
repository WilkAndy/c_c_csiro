The observations were carried out at 3\u2009cm (8.64 GHz) and 6\u2009cm (4.80 GHz) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Only HD\u200993129A (type O2 If*) was detected; we measure flux densities of mJy and mJy. The resulting spectral index of () indicates predominantly non-thermal emission, suggesting HD\u200993129A may be a binary system. We propose that the observed 3\u2009cm radio emission is mostly coming from the non-thermal wind collision region of a binary, and, to a lesser extent, from the thermal winds of the primary and secondary stars in HD\u200993129A. At a stellar distance of 2.8 kpc, we derive a mass-loss rate  \u2009yr-1, assuming the thermal fraction of the 3\u2009cm emission is ~0.5."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15971171658069392857", "cites_id": ["15971171658069392857"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2004/10/aa0138/aa0138.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2T0DDgEApd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
