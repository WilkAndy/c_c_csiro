The results improve substantially with respect to those of van der Hulst and show in detail the two merging galactic discs and the two tidal tails produced by their interaction. The small edge-on spiral dwarf galaxy ESO 572-G045 is also seen near the tip of the southern tail, but distinct from it. It shows no signs of tidal interaction. The northern tidal tail of the Antennae shows no H i connection to the discs and has an extension towards the west. The southern tidal tail is continuous, with a prominent H i concentration at its tip, roughly at the location of the tidal dwarf galaxy observed optically by Mirabel, Dottori & Lutz. Clear velocity structure is seen along the tidal tails and in the galactic discs.
