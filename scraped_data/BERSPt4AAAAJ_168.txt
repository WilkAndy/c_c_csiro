Though not without challenges, the dynamo theory can explain the large-scale coherent magnetic fields that govern galaxies, but observational evidence for the theory is so far very scarce. Putting together the available data of non-interacting, non-cluster galaxies with known large-scale magnetic fields, we find a tight correlation between the integrated polarized flux density, S PI, and the rotation speed, v rot, of galaxies. This leads to an almost linear correlation between the large-scale magnetic field  and v rot, assuming that the number of cosmic-ray electrons is proportional to the star formation rate, and a super-linear correlation assuming equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic rays. This correlation cannot be attributed to an active linear \u03b1-\u03a9 dynamo, as no correlation holds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9842179703369385886", "cites_id": ["9842179703369385886"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/818/1/L10/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nkfkSktylogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
