We find that the broad (\u03bbv~ 360 km s^-1^ absorption line seen at low spatial resolution is in fact a much narrower line which shifts its center velocity over the face of the source. The velocity center of the absorption changes from about+ 120 km s^-1^ relative to the systemic velocity in the northwest to-145 km s^-1^ in the southeast, following the rotation pattern in the outer regions of the galaxy. This is interpreted as a thick ring (torus) of cold, dense gas with a rotation velocity of about 250 km s^-1^ and radius 500 pc. From our data the ring is not expanding or infalling rapidly. We suggest that similar HI rings are also present in numerous other galaxies (eg, NGC 660, NGC 3079, NGC 4945) for which the width of the unresolved nuclear absorption line \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10999952359254568181", "cites_id": ["10999952359254568181"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993ApJ...402L..41K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9ayW92Oup5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 7, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
