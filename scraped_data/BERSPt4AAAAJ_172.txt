The sightlines searched have impact parameters of 10\u201320 kpc. By targeting nearby galaxies, we are also able to map their H\u2009i emission, allowing us to directly relate the absorption-line detection rate to the extended H\u2009i distribution. The continuum sightlines intersect the H\u2009i disc in four of the six galaxies, but no intervening absorption was detected. Of these four galaxies, we find that three of the non-detections are the result of the background source being too faint. In the fourth case, we find that the ratio of the spin temperature to the covering factor (TS/f) must be much higher than expected (\u22735700 K) in order to explain the non-detection. We discuss how the structure of the background continuum sources may have affected the detection rate of H\u2009i absorption \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16160612483066413298", "cites_id": ["16160612483066413298"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/450/1/926/995310", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8sDqRW4HRuAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
