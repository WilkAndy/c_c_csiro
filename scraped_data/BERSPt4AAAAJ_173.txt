Markedly different from other extreme H i disks in the local universe, it is a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) with an actively star-forming disk (> 50 kpc), central to its\u223c 130 kpc gas disk, with a total star formation rate (SFR) of\u223c 20.5 M\u2609 yr-1. Spitzer spectroscopy reveals an unusual combination of powerful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission coupled to a relatively weak warm dust continuum, suggesting photodissociation-region-dominated emission. Compared to a typical LIRG with similar total infrared luminosity (L TIR= 10 11 L\u2609), the PAHs in HIZOA J0836-43 are more than twice as strong, whereas the warm dust continuum (\u03bb> 20 \u03bcm) is best fit by a star-forming galaxy with L TIR= 10 10 L\u2609.
