With a radius of 57pc and an expansion velocity of about 10km/s, this new bubble appears similar to those previously found around other Wolf-Rayet stars. Since stars of WN6-7 spectral sub-type are often found in open clusters and associations, we suggest that the observed HI bubble may be related to an undetected OB association. A second HI void in the neighbourhood is briefly discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11239753522873919397", "cites_id": ["11239753522873919397"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996A%26A...312..283C", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pWfYPUeg-5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 6, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
