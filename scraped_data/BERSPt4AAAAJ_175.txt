We use archival HIPASS and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of this group to validate the new ASKAP data and the data reduction pipeline ASKAP\u2009soft. We detect six galaxies in the neutral hydrogen (H\u2009i) 21-cm line, expanding the NGC\u20097162 group membership from four to seven galaxies. Two of the new detections are also the first H\u2009i detections of the dwarf galaxies, AM\u20092159-434 and GALEXASC J220338.65-431128.7, for which we have measured velocities of cz = 2558 and cz = 2727\u2009km\u2009s\u22121, respectively. We confirm that there is extended H\u2009i emission around NGC\u20097162 possibly due to past interactions in the group as indicated by the 40\u00b0 offset between the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10063845884258450299", "cites_id": ["10063845884258450299"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/482/3/3591/5146467", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e3uA3YL2qYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
