Observations of the NH 3 (J, K)=(3, 3) inversion transition made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array reveal emission at locations where infrared H 2 emission had been detected previously, near the strongest dust emission in the core of the Homunculus. We also detect ammonia emission from the so-called strontium filament in the equatorial disk. The presence of NH 3 around \u03b7 Car hints that molecular shells around some Wolf-Rayet stars could have originated in prior LBV eruptions, rather than in cool red supergiant winds or the ambient interstellar medium. Combined with the lack of any CO detection, NH 3 seems to suggest that the Homunculus is nitrogen-rich like the ionized ejecta around \u03b7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7029591197039545838", "cites_id": ["7029591197039545838"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/505934/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7k3BB_MfjmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
