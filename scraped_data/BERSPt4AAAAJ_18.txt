The mean fraction f WIM of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59\u00b10.19, slightly higher than found in previous samples. Since lower surface brightness galaxies tend to have higher f WIM, we believe that most of this difference is due to selection effects favoring large, optically bright, nearby galaxies with high star formation rates. As found in previous studies, there is no appreciable correlation with Hubble type or total star formation rate. However, we find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an H\u03b1 surface brightness> 2.5\u00d7 10 39 erg s-1 kpc-2 within the H\u03b1 half-light radius, do show much lower fractions of diffuse H\u03b1 emission. The cause apparently is not dominated by a lower fraction of field \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18242874568520075815", "cites_id": ["18242874568520075815"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/517867/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J4ql4sO1K_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 8, "2009": 11, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 13, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 12, "2019": 23, "2020": 21, "2021": 20, "2022": 19, "2023": 5}}
