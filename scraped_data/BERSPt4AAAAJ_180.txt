The observations were made using the multibeam system on the Parkes 64-m radiotelescope, as part of the Galaxy Evolution Multiwavelength Study. We find twelve H\u2003i detections in our Parkes data, four more than catalogued in H\u2003i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). We find two new group members, and discover an isolated region of H\u2003i gas with an H\u2003i mass of \u223c4 \u00d7 108\u2003M\u2299, without a visible corresponding optical counterpart. We discuss the likelihood of this H\u2003i region being a low surface brightness galaxy, primordial gas, or a remnant of tidal debris. For the NGC 3783 group we derive a mean recession velocity of 2903 \u00b1 26\u2003km\u2003s\u22121, and a velocity dispersion of 190 \u00b1 24\u2003km\u2003s\u22121. The galaxy NGC 3783 is the nearest galaxy to the luminosity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2708143606779805251", "cites_id": ["2708143606779805251"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/371/2/739/1031746", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q_7aEkNClSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
