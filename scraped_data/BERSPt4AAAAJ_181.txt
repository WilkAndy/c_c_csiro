The main result is that they have detected in the radio continuum and in H\u03b1 a circumnuclear structure that would correspond to a so-called nuclear ring at a mean distance of about 300 pc from the nucleus. The mean radio continuum spectral index, using the integrated total fluxes is \u03b1=-0.7 (S \u03bd\u2261 \u03bd \u03b1), but it is flatter when using the fluxes of individual sources suggesting a superposition of thermal and non-thermal radiation. The radio continuum and H\u03b1 emissions indicate an enhanced star formation activity in the ring giving rise to the thermal emission from H II regions and the nonthermal emission from the evolution of massive stars into supernovae and supernova remnants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=37950058190456498", "cites_id": ["37950058190456498"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991RMxAA..22..197G", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ssaleWDThgAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
