These images are part of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Early Science Project (ESP) survey of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds. The two new source lists produced from these images contain radio continuum sources observed at 960\u2009MHz (4489 sources) and 1320\u2009MHz (5954 sources) with a bandwidth of 192\u2009MHz and beam sizes of 30.0 \u00d7 30.0 arcsec2 and 16.3 \u00d7 15.1 arcsec2, respectively. The median root mean square (RMS) noise values are 186\u2009Jy\u2009beam\u22121 (960\u2009MHz) and 165\u2009Jy\u2009beam\u22121 (1320\u2009MHz). To create point source catalogues, we use these two source lists, together with the previously published Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13561002406274287462", "cites_id": ["13561002406274287462"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/490/1/1202/5572473", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zkcy2NZbMrwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
