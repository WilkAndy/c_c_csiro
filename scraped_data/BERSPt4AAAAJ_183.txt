We detect 31 H\u2009i sources in the Sculptor group/filament, eight of which are new H\u2009i detections. We derive a slope of the H\u2009i mass function along the Sculptor filament of , which is significantly flatter than the global mass function and consistent with the flat slopes previously found in other low-density group environments. Some physical process, such as star formation, photoionization or ram-pressure stripping, must therefore be responsible for removing neutral gas predominantly from low-mass galaxies. All of our H\u2009i detections have a confirmed or tentative optical counterpart and are likely associated with luminous rather than \u2018dark\u2019 galaxies.
