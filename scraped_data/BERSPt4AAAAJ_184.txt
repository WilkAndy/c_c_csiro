We present N-body simulations with stars and gas and 21 cm Hi\u2009observations carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array of the large-scale distribution and kinematics of atomic gas. Hi\u2009is detected toward the companion, corresponding to a gas mass of ~. NGC 6872 contains \u223c of Hi\u2009gas, distributed in an extended rotating disk. Massive concentrations of gas (\u223c) are found at the tip of both tidal tails and towards the break seen in the optical northern arm near the companion. We detect no Hi\u2009counterpart to the X-ray trail between NGC 6872 and NGC 6876, the dominant elliptical galaxy in the Pavo group located \u223c to the southeast. At the sensitivity and the resolution of the observations, there is no sign in the overall Hi\u2009distribution that NGC 6876 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5378664087753994494", "cites_id": ["5378664087753994494"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2007/10/aa6023-06/aa6023-06.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_jC6jH3apEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
