The observed radio ring, ORC J0102\u20132450, has a diameter of \u223c70 arcsec or 300 kpc, if associated with the central elliptical galaxy DES J010224.33\u2013245039.5 (z \u223c 0.27). Considering the overall radio morphology (circular ring and core) and lack of ring emission at non-radio wavelengths, we investigate if ORC J0102\u20132450 could be the relic lobe of a giant radio galaxy seen end on or the result of a giant blast wave. We also explore possible interaction scenarios, for example, with the companion galaxy, DES J010226.15\u2013245104.9, located in or projected on to the south-eastern part of the ring. We encourage the search for further ORCs in radio surveys to study their properties and origin."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:WwIwg2wKZ0QC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17466854529470055486", "cites_id": ["17466854529470055486"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/505/1/L11/6261191", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PkR8tKa7ZvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
