LGG 351 resides behind the M 83 group at a velocity range (cz) of \u223c3500\u20134800 km s\u22121 within the rich Hydra-Centaurus overdensity region. We detect 40 sources with the discovery of a tidally interacting galaxy pair and two new H\u2009i sources that are not presented in previous optical catalogues. 23 out of 40 sources have new redshifts derived from the new H\u2009i data. This study is the largest WALLABY sub-sample to date and also allows us to further validate the performance of ASKAP and the data reduction pipeline askapsoft. Extended H\u2009i emission is seen in six galaxies indicating interaction within the group, although no H\u2009i debris is found. We also detect H\u2009i in a known ultra-faint dwarf \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12322186024909649653", "cites_id": ["12322186024909649653"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/489/4/5723/5565066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9bYFZ-cyAasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
