Monitoring the emission at radio wavelengths can be used to help disentangle the physical mechanisms responsible for this excess, including free\u2013free emission from a wind or jet, and chromospheric emission associated with stellar activity. We present new results from a radio monitoring survey conducted with Australia Telescope Compact Array over the course of several years with observation intervals spanning days, months and years, where the flux variability of 11 T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon and Lupus star-forming regions was measured at 7 and 15 mm, and 3 and 6 cm. Results show that most sources are variable to some degree at 7 mm, indicating the presence of emission mechanisms other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13618939476121281748", "cites_id": ["13618939476121281748"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/466/4/4083/2877227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1OTAG0wxAL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
