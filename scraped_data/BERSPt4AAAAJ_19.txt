SoFiA combines for the first time in a single piece of software a set of new source-finding and parametrization algorithms developed on the way to future H i surveys with ASKAP (WALLABY, DINGO) and APERTIF. It is designed to enable the general use of these new algorithms by the community on a broad range of data sets. The key advantages of SoFiA are the ability to: search for line emission on multiple scales to detect 3D sources in a complete and reliable way, taking into account noise level variations and the presence of artefacts in a data cube; estimate the reliability of individual detections; look for signal in arbitrarily large data cubes using a catalogue of 3D coordinates as a prior; provide a wide range of source parameters and output products which facilitate further analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10761941221647444774", "cites_id": ["10761941221647444774"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/448/2/1922/1058751", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JuvtmYUYWpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 11, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 26, "2020": 17, "2021": 40, "2022": 37, "2023": 20}}
