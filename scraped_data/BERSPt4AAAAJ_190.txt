We probe to a surface brightness of \u223c25 mag arcsec\u22122, reaching a 40 times lower stellar density than the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Employing extremely careful and rigorous cleaning techniques to remove contaminating sources, we perform surface photometry on 33 detected galaxies deriving the observed total magnitude, effective surface brightness and best-fitting S\u00e9rsic parameters. We make image quality and surface photometry comparisons to 2MASS and VISTA Hemisphere Survey demonstrating that deep targeted surveys are still the most reliable means of obtaining accurate surface photometry. We investigate the B \u2212 H colours \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15719661560010123498", "cites_id": ["15719661560010123498"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/444/4/3052/1018971", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6ijECed0J9oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
