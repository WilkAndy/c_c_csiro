The initial steps (bias subtraction, flat-fielding, etc.) are the same as for calibration of CCD images, and the wavelength calibration is similar to that in optical spectroscopy. The final steps are specific to Fabry-Perot instruments, and include the fitting of several instrumental parameters and a phase correction to convert the raw (x, y, z) data cube into a useful position-velocity (\u03b1, \u03b4, v) cube. Software has been written to assist with the latter steps of the data reduction. H\u03b1 observations of NGC 1808, NGC 2442 and Circinus are used to demonstrate the reduction process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16676593400054606007", "cites_id": ["16676593400054606007"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/315/2/248/981408", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t-jgSVcpb-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
