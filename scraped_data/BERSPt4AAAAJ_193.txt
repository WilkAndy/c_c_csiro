Our observations are sensitive to H\u2009i column densities typical of Damped Lyman Alpha absorbers (DLAs) in cool gas with an H\u2009i spin temperature below about 300\u2013500\u2009K. The six-dish Boolardy Engineering Test Array (BETA) and twelve-antenna Early Science array (ASKAP-12) covered a frequency range corresponding to redshift 0.4 < z < 1.0 and 0.37 < z < 0.77, respectively, for the H\u2009i line. Fifty of the 53 radio sources observed have reliable optical redshifts, giving a total redshift path \u0394z = 21.37. This was a spectroscopically untargeted survey, with no prior assumptions about the location of the lines in redshift space. Four intervening H\u2009i lines were detected, two of them new. In each case, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:m4fbC6XIj1kC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5520000877322000939", "cites_id": ["5520000877322000939"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/499/3/4293/5899746", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K1qfPI37mkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
