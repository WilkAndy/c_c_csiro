Our search for extended H\u2009i emission revealed a large complex of H\u2009i clouds near IC\u20091459, likely to be the debris from tidal interactions with neighbouring galaxies. The total H\u2009i mass (\u223c109\u2009M\u2299) in the detected clouds spans 250 kpc from the north-east of the gas-rich spiral NGC 7418A to the south-east of IC\u20091459. The extent and mass of the H\u2009i debris, which shows rather irregular morphology and kinematics, are similar to those in other nearby groups. Together with H\u2009i clouds recently detected near two other IC\u20091459 group members, namely IC\u20095270 and NGC 7418, using phased-array feeds on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the detected debris make up a significant fraction of the group's intergalactic medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1508543962886153490", "cites_id": ["1508543962886153490"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/473/3/3358/4243607", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EqXj271s7xQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
