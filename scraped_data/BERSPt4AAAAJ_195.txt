We find a large H i envelope associated with a nearby companion, the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1602. The H i covers a region \u224811.9 \u00d7 13.4 arcmin2 (62 \u00d7 70 kpc2) and the total H i mass detected is 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (assuming an 18-Mpc distance). The H i is centred on NGC 1602 but appears to have two tidal tails, one of which crosses over NGC 1596. The H i located at the position of NGC 1596 has a velocity gradient in the same sense as the ionized gas, that is, opposite to the stellar rotation. Both the existence of a large gas reservoir and the velocity gradient of the H i and the ionized gas strongly suggest that the ionized gas in NGC 1596 originated from NGC 1602. From the length of the H i tails, we conclude that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1248682097740528016", "cites_id": ["1248682097740528016"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/370/3/1565/1160896", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kLk2icA1VBEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
