It was first detected at 888 MHz with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and with a diameter of \u223c196 arcsec. This source has phenomenological similarities to odd radio circles (ORCs). Significant differences to the known ORCs \u2013 a flatter radio spectral index, the lack of a prominent central galaxy as a possible host, and larger apparent size \u2013 suggest that J0624\u20136948 may be a different type of object. We argue that the most plausible explanation for J0624\u20136948 is an intergalactic supernova remnant due to a star that resided in the LMC outskirts that had undergone a single-degenerate type Ia supernova, and we are seeing its remnant expand into a rarefied, intergalactic environment. We also examine if a massive star or a white dwarf \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:rLGzs9wiiwIC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6730917473993581844", "cites_id": ["6730917473993581844"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/512/1/265/6522201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FGXb2ccFaV0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
