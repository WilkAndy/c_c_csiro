We use both Chandra and XMM-Newton observations to investigate its X-ray properties, together with supporting high-resolution optical imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), infrared imaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and Australia Telescope Compact Array ground-based radio data. We detect 28 X-ray sources within the D 25 area of the galaxy; many are spatially correlated with star formation in the bar and spiral arms, and two are identified as background galaxies in the HST images. Nine of the X-ray sources are ultraluminous X-ray sources, with the three brightest (L X> 5\u00d7 10 39 erg s\u2212 1) located at the ends of the bar. With the spatial resolution of Chandra, we are able to show for the first time that NGC 1672 possesses a hard (\u0393\u223c 1.5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3455100695580182578", "cites_id": ["3455100695580182578"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/734/1/33/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MghD18b78i8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
