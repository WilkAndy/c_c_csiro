The catalogue data comprise the southern region \u03b4 < + 2\u00b0 of HIPASS, the first blind H i survey to cover the entire southern sky. The rms noise for this survey is 13 mJy beam \u22121 and the velocity range is \u22121280 to 12 700 km s \u22121. Data search, verification and parametrization methods are discussed along with a description of measured quantities. Full catalogue data are made available to the astronomical community including positions, velocities, velocity widths, integrated fluxes and peak flux densities. Also available are on-sky moment maps, position\u2013velocity moment maps and spectra of catalogue sources. A number of local large-scale features are observed in the space distribution of sources, including the super-Galactic plane and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 661, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13943808365288346722", "cites_id": ["13943808365288346722"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/350/4/1195/985845", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YtQhrdRbgsEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 9, "2005": 28, "2006": 27, "2007": 34, "2008": 36, "2009": 31, "2010": 38, "2011": 35, "2012": 32, "2013": 27, "2014": 34, "2015": 36, "2016": 39, "2017": 33, "2018": 47, "2019": 47, "2020": 36, "2021": 40, "2022": 34, "2023": 14}}
