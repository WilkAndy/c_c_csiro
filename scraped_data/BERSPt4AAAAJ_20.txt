The relation is remarkably tight with a scatter \u03c3 \u223c 0.06 dex, or 14 per cent. The scatter does not change as a function of galaxy luminosity, H\u2009i richness or morphological type. The relation is linked to the fact that dwarf and spiral galaxies have a homogeneous radial profile of H\u2009i surface density in the outer regions when the radius is normalized by DH\u2009i. The early-type disc galaxies typically have shallower H\u2009i radial profiles, indicating a different gas accretion history. We argue that the process of atomic-to-molecular gas conversion or star formation cannot explain the tightness of the DH\u2009i\u2013MH\u2009i relation. This simple relation puts strong constraints on simulation models for galaxy formation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 185, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16326730215079330261", "cites_id": ["16326730215079330261"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/460/2/2143/2609089", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1cFwvaAylOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 16, "2018": 11, "2019": 13, "2020": 34, "2021": 33, "2022": 55, "2023": 17}}
