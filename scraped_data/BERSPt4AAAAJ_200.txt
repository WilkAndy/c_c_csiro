The characteristics and the uncovered large-scale structures of this survey are described, in particular the prominence of the Norma Supercluster, the possible cluster around PKS 1343\u2013601 (both in the Great Attractor region), as well as the Local Void and the clustering in the Puppis region. In this blind HI survey HIZOA J0836\u201343 was discovered, one of the most massive spiral galaxies known to date (MHI = 7.3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299, MT = 1.1 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299; H0 = 75 km/s/Mpc). Although of similar mass to Malin 1-like objects, this galaxy does not share their typical low-surface brightness properties, but seems an exceptionally massive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13854105622834388425", "cites_id": ["13854105622834388425"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/universe-behind-the-southern-milky-way/194C3C17015B6499F55AAB376900735A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yR3JaamrQ8AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2}}
