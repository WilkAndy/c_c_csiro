The median root mean squared noise is 58 Jy beam\u22121. We present a catalogue of 54\u2009612 sources, divided over a Gold list (30\u2009866 sources) complete down to 0.5 mJy uniformly across the field, a Silver list (22\u2009080 sources) reaching down to <0.2 mJy, and a Bronze list (1666 sources) of visually inspected sources in areas of high noise and/or near bright complex emission. We discuss detections of planetary nebulae and their radio luminosity function, young stellar objects showing a correlation between radio luminosity and gas temperature, novae and X-ray binaries in the LMC, and active stars in the Galactic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7151876580076224327", "cites_id": ["7151876580076224327"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/506/3/3540/6313301", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R__geNuRQGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
