We find that majority of the central Choir galaxies have average H\u2009i content: they have a normal gas-mass fraction with respect to isolated galaxies of the same stellar mass. In contrast, we find more satellite galaxies with a lower gas-mass fraction than isolated galaxies of the same stellar mass. A likely reason for the lower gas content in these galaxies is tidal stripping. Both the specific star formation rate and the star formation efficiency of the central group galaxies are similar to galaxies in isolation. The Choir satellite galaxies have similar specific star formation rate as galaxies in isolation, therefore satellites that exhibit a higher star formation efficiency simply owe it to their lower gas-mass fractions. We find that the most H\u2009i massive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14403601049406603385", "cites_id": ["14403601049406603385"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/483/4/5409/5266834", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eQBTRNfe48cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
