Each system has one or more optically identified galaxy at a similar or as yet unknown redshift within a 50-kpc projected radius. Using H i synthesis imaging data, we investigate the hypothesis that the counter-rotating gas in these galaxies has been accreted from their neighbours. In NGC 128 and NGC 3203, we find 9.6\u00d7 107 and 2.3\u00d7 108 M\u2299 of H i, respectively, covering almost the entire stellar bodies of dwarf companions that appear physically connected. Both the H i morphology and kinematics are suggestive of tidal interactions. In NGC 7332, we do not find any directly associated H i. Instead, NGC 7339, a neighbour of a comparable size at about 10 kpc, is found with 8.9\u00d7 108 M\u2299 of H i gas.
