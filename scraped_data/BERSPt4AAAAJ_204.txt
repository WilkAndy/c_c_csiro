Similarly, sophisticated visualisation tools are needed to explore the resulting survey data together with their multi-wavelength counterparts.In this PASA Special Issue on Source Finding and Visualisation, several advanced source-finding algorithms, including novel methods for radio continuum, polarisation and spectral line surveys are described, tested and compared. The process of finding sources can be considered one of many important steps (e.g., pre-processing, source finding and characterisation, cataloguing/post-processing) in the production of astronomical source catalogues, on which much of the survey science is based.The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP), equipped with novel Chequerboard phased array feeds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10875898091446928006", "cites_id": ["10875898091446928006"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/source-finding-and-visualisation/ADA448591FA7F555687B6D80BCDEC098", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hgIL8rDz7pYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
