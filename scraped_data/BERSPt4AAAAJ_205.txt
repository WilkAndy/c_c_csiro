The higher spatial resolution of the ATCA allows us to clearly identify the optical counterparts for the first time \u2013 most being associated with low surface brightness late-type galaxies. New integrated H i maps and velocity fields for each source are presented. We find several interacting systems; one of which contains three galaxies within a common H i envelope. Extended H i structures in the sample are more consistent with tidal effects than ram pressure stripping. We identify two H i detections with previously uncatalogued optical galaxies, and add a total of six newly identified group members to the NGC 3923, 5044 and 7144 groups."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7631986212222789257", "cites_id": ["7631986212222789257"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/384/1/305/965662", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ieY3JgZD6mkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
