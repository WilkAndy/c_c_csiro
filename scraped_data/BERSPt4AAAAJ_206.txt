The data reveal an extended, rather disturbed Hi distribution for the peculiar starburst galaxy NGC 1511 and a narrow bridge to its small companion galaxy, NGC 1511B, which has been severely distorted by the interaction/collision between the two galaxies. No stellar counterpart to the gaseous bridge has been detected. In addition, we find that the peculiar optical ridge to the east of NGC 1511 is probably the stellar remnant of a galaxy completely disrupted by interactions with NGC 1511. The slightly more distant neighbour, NGC 1511A, shows a regular Hi velocity field and no obvious signs of interactions.Radio continuum emission from NGC 1511 reveals three prominent sources on top of a more diffuse, extended distribution. We derive an overall star \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10051876798346716196", "cites_id": ["10051876798346716196"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/358/1/202/1035568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JGRy47Bwf4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
