The mass of the Faraday-active plasma is larger than that of the X-ray-emitting ICM and exists in a density regime that broadly matches expectations for moderately dense components of the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium. We argue that forthcoming RM grids from both targeted and survey observations may be a singular probe of cosmic plasma in this regime. The morphology of the global Faraday depth enhancement is not uniform and isotropic but rather exhibits the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7117540192243081937", "cites_id": ["7117540192243081937"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/early-science-from-possum-shocks-turbulence-and-a-massive-new-reservoir-of-ionised-gas-in-the-fornax-cluster/9DF3F1D3FFC020F1A9299444420D71D4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0eI2MRiVxmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
