For the first time, we show that WALLABY can reach its final survey sensitivity. Leveraging the sensitivity, spatial resolution, and wide field of view of WALLABY, we identify a galaxy, ESO\u2009501\u2212G075, that lies near the virial radius of Hydra I and displays an H\u2009i tail. ESO\u2009501\u2212G075 shows a similar level of morphological asymmetry as another cluster member, which lies near the cluster centre and shows signs of experiencing ram pressure. We investigate possible environmental processes that could be responsible for producing the observed disturbance in the H\u2009i morphology of ESO\u2009501\u2212G075. We rule out tidal interactions, as ESO\u2009501\u2212G075 has no nearby neighbours within \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Vr2j17o0sqMC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10802442578368730010", "cites_id": ["10802442578368730010"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/505/2/1891/6275722", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mhM5jkr86ZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
