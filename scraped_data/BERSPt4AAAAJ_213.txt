Applying the two star formation rate indicators on 294 local galaxies, we determine log( [M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123] and log()  [M\u2299 yr\u22121 Mpc\u22123]. These values are derived from scaling H\u03b1 and FUV observations to the H\u2009i mass function. Galaxies were selected to uniformly sample the full H\u2009i mass ($M_{\\rm{H\\,\\small {I}}}$) range of the H\u2009i Parkes All-Sky Survey ($M_{\\rm{H\\,\\small {I}}} \\sim 10^{7}$ to \u223c1010.7 M\u2299). The approach leads to relatively larger sampling of dwarf galaxies compared to optically selected surveys. The low H\u2009i mass, low luminosity, and low surface brightness galaxy populations have, on average, lower H\u03b1/FUV flux ratios than the remaining galaxy populations, consistent with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=969042504444158993", "cites_id": ["969042504444158993"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/480/1/119/5036531", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ESSmCQa7cg0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
