We find that the total H i column density of 5* E 22 ((T_sp)/(100 K)) cm-2 is divided into three narrow (FWHM<= 16 km s-1) and one broad component (FWHM 50 km s-1). The narrow components have H i column densities of~ 5* E 21 ((T_sp)/(100 K)) cm-2 and there is evidence that they have sizes=~ 15 pc and H i densities of~ 150 ((T_sp)/(100 K)) cm-3. The broad absorption component shows a velocity gradient in the same direction as the CO disk observed in this source. We argue that this broad component could be due to a circumnuclear disk or torus. The observed velocity gradient implies that this structure has radius~ 50-100 pc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6930663788114720448", "cites_id": ["6930663788114720448"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000A%26A...357....7P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wLY9vP6pLmAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
