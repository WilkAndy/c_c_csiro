We reveal the detailed distribution of the molecular gas in the central region for the first time: a shell structure in the northwest, a barely resolved blob in the southeast of the center, and some clumps between them. The total molecular gas mass obtained with a standard Milky Way CO-to-H2 conversion factor is , which is consistent with previous studies. The disturbed velocity field of the molecular gas suggests that the molecular gas was injected very recently (<1\u2009Gyr) if it has an external origin, and is in the process of settling into a rotating disk. Assuming that a low-mass gas-rich galaxy has accreted, the gas-to-dust ratio and H2-to-H\u2009i ratio are unusually low (\u223c28) and high (\u223c5.6 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9048905783081289661", "cites_id": ["9048905783081289661"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article-abstract/71/4/85/5550038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vceJ1t0rlH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
