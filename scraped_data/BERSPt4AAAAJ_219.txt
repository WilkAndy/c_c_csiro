In our Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG) we found 15 cases of HiPASS sources containing four or more emission line galaxies (ELGs). We name these fields Choir groups. In the most extreme case, we found a field with at least nine ELGs. In this paper, we present a catalogue of Choir group members in the context of the wider SINGG sample.The dwarf galaxies in the Choir groups would not be individually detectable in HiPASS at the observed distances if they were isolated, but are detected in SINGG narrow-band imaging due to their membership of groups with sufficiently large total H\u2009i mass. The ELGs in these groups are similar to the wider SINGG sample in terms of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=21236296239747209", "cites_id": ["21236296239747209"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/433/1/543/1035804", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iRC3hUxySwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
