Here we present predictions for two proposed extragalactic ASKAP neutral hydrogen (H\u2009i) emission-line surveys, based on semi-analytic models applied to cosmological N-body simulations. The ASKAP H\u2009i All-Sky Survey, known as Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY), is a shallow 3 \u03c0 survey\u2028(z = 0\u20130.26) which will probe the mass and dynamics of over 6 \u00d7 105 galaxies. A much deeper small-area H\u2009i survey, called Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO), aims to trace the evolution of H\u2009i from z = 0 to 0.43, a cosmological volume of 4 \u00d7 107\u2009Mpc3, detecting potentially 105 galaxies. The high-sensitivity 30 antenna ASKAP core (diameter \u223c2\u2009km) will provide an angular resolution of 30\u2009arcsec (at z = 0). Our simulations show that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5374050712815282911", "cites_id": ["5374050712815282911"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/426/4/3385/1019044", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3ypKfqZ2lEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 18, "2015": 22, "2016": 21, "2017": 22, "2018": 17, "2019": 25, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
