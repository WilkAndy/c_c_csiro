What makes this volume special is the fact that we can obtain (a) accurate velocities and independent distances for all its member galaxies,(b) the most detailed and sensitive multi-frequency observations, and (c), as a result, a complete census of the Local Volume (LV) galaxies and their properties. This allows us to create a dynamic 3D view of the Local Universe, leading to a thorough understanding of the local flow field, ie. the Hubble flow and its dispersion. Interferometric H i measurements in particular provide a greater understanding of the overall matter distribution (baryonic and non-baryonic) in the Local Volume and are crucial to accurately define the low-mass end of the H i mass function. Reliable, independent distance estimates for LV galaxies are being gathered either from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3861267617317015257,16320851735659777947,17870297611596734950", "cites_id": ["3861267617317015257", "16320851735659777947", "17870297611596734950"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_7.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2U7mqHD6lTUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
