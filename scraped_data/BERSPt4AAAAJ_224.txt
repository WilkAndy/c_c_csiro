The radio data within the first 1000\u2009d show clear signs of free\u2013free absorption (FFA), which decreases gradually and is minimal above 1.4 GHz after day \u223c3000. Constraints on the FFA optical depth provide estimates of the CSM free electron density, which allows insight into the ionization of SN 1996cr's CSM and offers a test on the density distribution adopted by the hydrodynamical simulation. The intrinsic spectral index of the radiation shows evidence for spectral flattening, which is characterized by \u03b1 = 0.852 \u00b1 0.002 at day \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17455384481450985905", "cites_id": ["17455384481450985905"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/431/3/2453/1074590", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sYnACrT7PfIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
