The survey was carried out at 887.5 MHz and covers an \u223c83 square deg field. We imaged the calibrated visibility data, taken as part of the Evolutionary Mapping of Universe Early Science Programme, using the latest version of the ASKAPSoft pipeline. The final mosaic has an angular resolution of 10 arcsec and a central rms noise of around 38 Jy beam\u22121. The derived radio source catalogue has 39 812 entries above a peak flux density threshold of 5\u03c3. We searched for the radio source host galaxy counterparts using the GAMA spectroscopic (with an i-band magnitude limit of 19.2 mag) and multiwavelength catalogues that are available as part of the collaboration. We identified hosts with GAMA spectroscopic redshifts for 5934 radio sources. We describe the data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:g8uWPOAv7ggC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5479172267570009780", "cites_id": ["5479172267570009780"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/512/4/6104/6566353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tJauvyXuCUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
