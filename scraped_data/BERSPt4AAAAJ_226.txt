These WALLABY observations cover a 60-square-degree field of view with uniform sensitivity and a spatial resolution of 30\u2009arcsec. We use these wide-field observations to investigate the effect of galaxy environment on H\u2009i gas removal and star formation quenching by comparing the properties of cluster, infall, and field galaxies extending up to \u223c5R200 from the cluster centre. We find a sharp decrease in the H\u2009i-detected fraction of infalling galaxies at a projected distance of \u223c1.5R200 from the cluster centre from  to . We see evidence for the environment removing gas from the outskirts of H\u2009i-detected cluster and infall galaxies through the decrease in the H\u2009i to r-band optical disc diameter ratio.
