We used 16 antennas to observe a 30 square degree region in a single 12-h pointing over a 240 MHz band centred on 913 MHz. Our observations achieve an angular resolution of 26\u00d733 arcseconds (480 parsecs), a maximum recoverable angular scale of 30 arcminutes, and a full-band sensitivity of 85 \u03bcJy beam\u22121. The resulting maps of polarisation and Faraday rotation are amongst the most detailed ever made for radio lobes, with order 105 resolution elements covering the source. We describe several as-yet unreported observational features of the lobe, including its detailed peak Faraday depth structure, and intricate networks of depolarised filaments. These results demonstrate the exciting capabilities of ASKAP for widefield radio polarimetry."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8585061696121984432", "cites_id": ["8585061696121984432"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/372996", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sNUphCBEJHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
