The observations were carried out using the HEterodyne Receiver Array (HERA) at the 30 m IRAM telescope in the CO(2\u20131) line, achieving a resolution of 12\u2033 \u00d7 2.6   km   s-1, enabling individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) to be resolved. The observed region is 650 square arcminutes mainly along the major axis and out to a radius of 8.5 kpc, and covers entirely the 2\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032 radial strip observed with the HIFI and PACS Spectrometers as part of the HERM33ES Herschel key program. The achieved sensitivity in main-beam temperature is 20\u201350 mK at 2.6      km   s-1 velocity resolution. The CO(2\u20131) luminosity of the observed region is 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 107   K   km   s-1   pc2 and is estimated to be 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 107   K   km   s-1   pc2 for the entire galaxy, corresponding to H2 masses of 1.9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12109049742903579994", "cites_id": ["12109049742903579994"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2010/14/aa14441-10/aa14441-10.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WpVNrZX8C6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 20, "2012": 22, "2013": 6, "2014": 12, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 20, "2018": 13, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 16, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
