We report on observations by the MPS and MOA Collaborations of high magnification microlensing event MACHO-98-BLG-35 which has a low amplitude deviation which is consistent with the expected deviation caused by a planet with a mass of 2 x 10 (-5) of the mass of the primary lens. We indicate how, for future events, additional observations might provide data sufficient to claim discovery of a low mass planet, and we also discuss the future explansion of the MPS Project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17090882077148660520", "cites_id": ["17090882077148660520"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...19310805R/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KEOJorICL-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1}}
