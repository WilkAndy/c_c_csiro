Phase 1 of the WALLABY pilot survey targeted three regions on the sky in the direction of the Hydra and Norma galaxy clusters and the NGC 4636 galaxy group, covering the redshift range of . The source catalogue, images and spectra of nearly 600 extragalactic H i detections and kinematic models for 109 spatially resolved galaxies are available. As the pilot survey targeted regions containing nearby group and cluster environments, the median redshift of the sample of is relatively low compared to the full WALLABY survey. The median galaxy H i mass is . The target noise level of per 30\u2032\u2032 beam and channel translates into a H i mass sensitivity for point sources of about across 50 spectral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:BJtnxTr0fRcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11710289975128905579", "cites_id": ["11710289975128905579"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/wallaby-pilot-survey-public-release-of-h-i-data-for-almost-600-galaxies-from-phase-1-of-askap-pilot-observations/ADE053E1E08E6415AD08BD9396E8D715", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a1dgSLBOg6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 9}}
