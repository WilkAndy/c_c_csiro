The sample spans a stellar mass range of 8.3 \u2264\u2009 log(M\u22c6/M\u2299) \u2264 11.16, and a variety of morphological types. We use gas-phase metallicities derived from MUSE observations (from the Fornax3D survey) to study these ratios as a function of metallicity, and to study dust-to-metal ratios, in a sub-sample of nine galaxies. We find that gas-to-dust ratios in Fornax galaxies are systematically lower than those in field galaxies at fixed stellar mass/metallicity. This implies that a relatively large fraction of the metals in these Fornax systems is locked up in dust, which is possibly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:hNSvKAmkeYkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13431110173275464833", "cites_id": ["13431110173275464833"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/4/4723/6129797", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gSQ4oYrjZLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
