In this context, we observed the scorpio field at 912\u2009MHz with an uncompleted array consisting of 15 commissioned antennas. The resulting map covers a square region of \u223c40\u2009deg2, centred on (l, b)  = (343.5\u00b0, 0.75\u00b0), with a synthesized beam of 24 \u00d7 21\u2009arcsec2 and a background rms noise of 150\u2013200\u2009\u03bcJy\u2009beam\u22121, increasing to 500\u2013600\u2009\u03bcJy\u2009beam\u22121 close to the Galactic plane. A total of 3963 radio sources were detected and characterized in the field using the caesar source finder. We obtained differential source counts in agreement with previously published data after correction for source extraction and characterization uncertainties, estimated from simulated data. The ASKAP positional and flux density scale accuracy were also investigated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15593172365912180577", "cites_id": ["15593172365912180577"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/60/6070634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YQeij6YTZtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
