HI observations with high angular resolution and with sensitivity to very low column densities are some of the important observational ingredients that are currently still missing. Answers to these questions are necessary for a correct interpretation of observations of galaxy evolution in the high-redshift universe and will provide crucial input for the sub-grid physics in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolutions. In this chapter we discuss the progress that will be made with the SKA using targeted observations of nearby individual disk and dwarf galaxies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3194401593308353137", "cites_id": ["3194401593308353137"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01211", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cRIWD1PLVCwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
