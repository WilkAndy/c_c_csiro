I discuss the observing requirements for these surveys, which include stable calibration, excellent baseline stability, good sensitivity, good rejection of RFI and good sampling of the image plane. I also discuss data analysis, including the LiveData data reduction pipeline, which has been running continuously and in real time, using the aips++ toolkit, since 1997. The HIPASS and ZOA surveys have produced several new and interesting results including a closer look at the High Velocity Cloud population, the discovery of a Leading Arm to the Magellanic system, a new population of LSB galaxies in nearby groups, several intergalactic gas cloud candidates and new groupings of galaxies hidden behind the Milky Way.
