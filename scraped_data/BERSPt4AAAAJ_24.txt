These observations by the Microlensing Planet Search (MPS) and MOA collaborations place strong constraints on the possible planetary system of the lens star and show intriguing evidence for a low-mass planet with a mass fraction 4\u00d7 10-5\u2264 \u220d\u2264 2\u00d7 10-4. A giant planet with \u220d= 10-3 is excluded from 95% of the region between 0.4 and 2.5 R E from the lens star, where R E is the Einstein ring radius of the lens. This exclusion region is more extensive than the generic\" lensing zone,\" which is 0.6\u20131.6 R E. For smaller mass planets, we can exclude 57% of the\" lensing zone\" for \u220d= 10-4 and 14% of the lensing zone for \u220d= 10-5. The mass fraction \u220d= 10-5 corresponds to an Earth-mass planet for a lensing star of mass\u223c 0.3 M\u2299.
