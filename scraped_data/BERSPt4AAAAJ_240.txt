Our main results are: a) the HI morphology is irregular and perturbed, gathered in three blobs apparently unrelated to the optical morphology; b) the observed HI velocity distribution indicates a normal disk in differential rotation with a constant velocity out to a radius of 160'' (30 kpc), c) the inclination of the disk is about 25 deg with the kinematic major axis at a position angle slightly different from that of the stellar bar, d) the HI mass inside a radius of 18'' is only 2.1 10^7 Msun, the total HI mass within 180'' is 1.1 10^9 Msun and the dynamical mass is 2 10^{11} Msun. The bulk of the gas in NGC 3783 is outside the diameter of the stellar bar; e) Numerical simulations of the gas flow in the barred potential derived from the red image indicate that the pattern speed is Omega_p = 38 km/s/kpc: the ring of Halpha emitting regions encircling the bar would then correspond to UHR, and the Halpha accumulation in the center to a nuclear ring. Various possibilities are discussed to account for the active nucleus fuelling."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12601564930623494976", "cites_id": ["12601564930623494976"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9906492", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QFvV14nA4a4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
