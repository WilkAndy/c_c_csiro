In the first months after its launch in July 2019, the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma performed long-exposure observations in the regions around supernova (SN) 1987A and super-nova remnant (SNR) N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).Aims. We analysed the distribution and the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission in the observed fields to determine the physical properties of the hot phase of the interstellar medium (ISM).Methods. Spectral extraction regions were defined using the Voronoi tessellation method. The spectra were fit with a combination of thermal and non-thermal emission models. The eROSITA data are complemented by newly derived column density maps for the Milky Way and the LMC, 888 MHz radio continuum map from the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder, and optical images of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:7Frjd3zlGBUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16921455201344110486", "cites_id": ["16921455201344110486"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/05/aa41054-21/aa41054-21.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lj_NFtoV1eoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
