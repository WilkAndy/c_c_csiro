We obtain optical photometric measurements and quantify the strength of tidal perturbation using a tidal parameter S sum. For low-mass galaxies of M*\u2272 10 9 M\u2299, we find a dependence of decreasing H i to optical disk size ratio with increasing S sum, but no dependence of H i spectral line asymmetry with S sum. This is consistent with the behavior expected under tidal stripping. We confirm that the color profile shape and color gradient depend on the stellar mass, but there is an additional correlation of low-mass galaxies having their color gradients within 2R 50 increasing with higher S sum. For these low-mass galaxies, the dependence of color gradients on S sum is driven by the color becoming progressively redder in the inner disk when tidal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17158631470298410854", "cites_id": ["17158631470298410854"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac4270/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zq_5cmm0H-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
