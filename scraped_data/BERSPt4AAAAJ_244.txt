We use the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to test potential origins for this difference in field and cluster galaxies. We find, in agreement with observations, that on average disc-dominated field galaxies in the simulations have older inner regions, while similar galaxies in groups and clusters have similarly aged or younger inner regions. This environmental difference is a result of outside-in quenching of the cluster galaxies. Prior to group/cluster infall, galaxies of a given present-day mass and morphology exhibit a similar evolution in their specific star formation rate (sSFR) profiles. Post-infall, the outer sSFRs of group and cluster galaxies significantly decrease \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10744693851474939898", "cites_id": ["10744693851474939898"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/511/1/1072/6505154", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-s98TSHSHJUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
