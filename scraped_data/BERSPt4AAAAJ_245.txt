We investigate whether these \u2018dark\u2019 H\u2009i sources have resulted from past tidal interactions or whether they are an extreme class of low surface brightness galaxies. Our results suggest that both scenarios are possible, and not mutually exclusive. The two \u2018dark\u2019 H\u2009i sources are compact, reside in relative isolation, and are more than 159 kpc away from their nearest H\u2009i-rich galaxy neighbour. Regardless of origin, the H\u2009i sizes and masses of both \u2018dark\u2019 H\u2009i sources are consistent with the H\u2009i size\u2013mass relationship that is found in nearby low-mass galaxies, supporting the possibility that these H\u2009i \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:cBPnxVikjH8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15250202576907530810", "cites_id": ["15250202576907530810"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/2/2905/6347364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OvJR1XGao9MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
