It is found that LVHIS galaxies hold a tight linear FIR-radio correlation (FRC) over four orders of magnitude (). However, for detected galaxies only, a trend of larger FIR-to-radio ratio with decreasing flux density is observed. We estimate the star formation rate by combining UV and mid-IR data using empirical calibration. It is confirmed that both FIR and radio emission are strongly connected with star formation but with significant non-linearity. Dwarf galaxies are found radiation deficient in both bands, when normalized by star formation rate. It urges a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 to keep the FIR-to-radio ratio generally constant.
