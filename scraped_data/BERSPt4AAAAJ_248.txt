Our observations reveal for the first time the vast extent of the H\u2009i disc of this galaxy. The H\u2009i morphology and kinematics of NGC 922 show that this galaxy is not the product of a simple drop-through interaction, but has a more complex interaction history. The integrated H\u2009i flux density of NGC 922 from our observations is 24.7\u2009Jy km\u2009s\u22121, which is within the error of the flux value obtained using the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. This flux density translates to a total H\u2009i mass of 1.1 \u00d7 1010\u2009M\u2299 and corresponds to an H\u2009i to total mass fraction ($M_{{H\\,\\small {I}}}$/Mtot) of approximately 0.11. The gaseous structures of NGC 922 are more extended to the north and include an H\u2009i tail that has a projected physical length of 8 kpc. Gas warps are also evident in the velocity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6004291322519420192", "cites_id": ["6004291322519420192"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/476/4/5681/4969706", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IP26TiWHU1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
