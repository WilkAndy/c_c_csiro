A friends-of-friends algorithm is extensively tested on mock galaxy lightcones and then implemented on the real data to determine galaxy groups whose members are likely to be physically and dynamically associated with one another. We find several galaxy groups within the region that are likely bound to one another and in the process of merging. We classify 6 galaxy groups as the Ursa Major \u2018supergroup\u2019, which are likely to merge and form a poor cluster with a mass of ~ 8 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299. Furthermore, the Ursa Major supergroup as a whole is likely bound to the Virgo cluster, which will eventually form an even larger system in the context of hierarchical structure formation. We investigate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11648694780855179548", "cites_id": ["11648694780855179548"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/ursa-major-cluster-redefined-as-a-supergroup/A83A843F23ED4F87D28C8A9B5BC8017A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HNnRjS96qKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
