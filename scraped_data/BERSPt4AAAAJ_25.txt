It uses the widefield, high-resolution capability of the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a radio interferometer consisting of -m dishes equipped with Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radio-quiet zone in Western Australia. wallaby aims to survey three-quarters of the sky () to a redshift of , and generate spectral line image cubes at \u223c30 arcsec resolution and \u223c1.6 mJy\u2009beam\u22121 per 4 km\u2009s\u22121 channel sensitivity. ASKAP\u2019s instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered by the PAF\u2019s 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, wallaby is expected to detect around half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of  (\u223c200 Mpc).
