SoFiA combines several powerful source finding and parameterization algorithms, including wavelet denoising, spatial and spectral smoothing, source mask optimization, spectral profile fitting, and calculation of the reliability of detections. In addition to source catalogues in different formats, SoFiA can also generate a range of output data cubes and images, including source masks, moment maps, sub-cubes, position-velocity diagrams, and integrated spectra. The pipeline is controlled by simple parameter files and can either be invoked on the command line or interactively through a modern graphical user interface."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5270002144294256902", "cites_id": ["5270002144294256902"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ascl.soft12001S/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BsE0UAfPIkkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
