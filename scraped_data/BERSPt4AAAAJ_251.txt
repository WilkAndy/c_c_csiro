The 3D nature of the data allows detailed studies of the galaxy morphology and kinematics, their relation to local and global star formation as well as galaxy environments. I use new 3D visualisation tools to present multi-wavelength data, aided by tilted-ring models of the warped galaxy disks. Many of the algorithms and tools currently under development are essential for the exploration of upcoming large survey data, but are also highly beneficial for the analysis of current galaxy surveys."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17808137528148363333", "cites_id": ["17808137528148363333"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/local-universe-galaxies-in-3d/3B23C9780E7A38BA4C1527541B9DF719", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RQiW9Lo2I_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2}}
