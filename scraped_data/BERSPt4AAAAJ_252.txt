The lack of galaxies in that area must partly be influenced by the high foreground extinction and star density. Nevertheless, the reality of the void was never doubted as it extends beyond the optical and near-infrared Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) and can be traced to relatively high latitudes (see Figs. 1 and 2). The continuity of low galaxy density across the opaque part of the ZOA was recently corroborated by HIPASS [5, 9, 14], which is unaffected by extinction or star density. The actual size, extent and so-called \u201cemptiness\u201d of the Local Void has remained a matter of much debate. Some suggest the Local Void to be larger and extend to the more distant Microscopium (or Sagittarius) Void at cz\u223c 4500 kms\u2212 1 (eg [2]), while \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15889547336347149693", "cites_id": ["15889547336347149693"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:feW5sB0Dg9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
