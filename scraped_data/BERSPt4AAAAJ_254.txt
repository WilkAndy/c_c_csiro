The H i emission extends over all four galaxies but can only be associated clearly with the two spiral galaxies, NGC 6845A and B, which show signs of strong tidal interaction. We derive a total H i mass of at least 1.8 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299, most of which is associated with NGC 6845A, the largest galaxy of the group. We investigate the tidal interaction between NGC 6845A and B by studying the kinematics of distinct H i components and their relation to the known H ii regions. No H i emission is detected from the two lenticular galaxies, NGC 6845C and D. A previously uncatalogued dwarf galaxy, ATCA J2001\u22124659, was detected 4.4 arcmin NE from NGC 6845B and has an H i mass of \u223c5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299. No H i bridge is visible between the group and its newly detected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13748432604681276887", "cites_id": ["13748432604681276887"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/342/3/939/965328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1w1tlJw-zL4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
