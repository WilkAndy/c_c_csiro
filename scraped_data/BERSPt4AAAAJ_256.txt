We present new, highly sensitive radio continuum observations of Abell 3266 performed with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (0.8\u20131.1 GHz) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (1.1\u20133.1 GHz). These deep observations provide new insights into recently reported diffuse non-thermal phenomena associated with the intracluster medium, including a \u2018wrong-way\u2019 relic, a fossil plasma source, and an as-yet unclassified central diffuse ridge, which we reveal comprises the brightest part of a large-scale radio halo detected here for the first time. The \u2018wrong-way\u2019 relic is highly atypical of its kind: it exhibits many classical signatures of a shock-related radio relic, while at the same time exhibiting strong spectral steepening. While radio relics are generally consistent with a quasi-stationary shock \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:h168fVGZblEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3137643231471182980", "cites_id": ["3137643231471182980"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/515/2/1871/6650456", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hKS_I-UliysJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
