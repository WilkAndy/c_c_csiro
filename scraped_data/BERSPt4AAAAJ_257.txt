With a physical resolution of \u223c1 kpc, we detect a complex web of low-surface-brightness H\u2009i emission down to a 4\u03c3 column density level of \u223c1 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (over 44  km\u2009s\u22121). The newly discovered H\u2009i streams extend over \u223c20 arcmin corresponding to 140 kpc in projection. This is approximately three times the H\u2009i extent of the galaxy triplet (52 kpc). The H\u2009i debris has an H\u2009i mass of \u223c6.6 \u00d7 109 M\u2299, more than 50 per cent of the total H\u2009i mass of the triplet. Within the galaxy triplet, NGC 7233 and NGC 7232 have lost a significant amount of H\u2009i while NGC 7232B appears to have an excess of H\u2009i. The H\u2009i deficiency in NGC 7232 and NGC 7233 indicates that galaxy\u2013galaxy interaction in the group concentrates on this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:DXE8ND7PrJAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9354352930946059643", "cites_id": ["9354352930946059643"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/505/3/3795/6291205", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e42s4G1W0YEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
