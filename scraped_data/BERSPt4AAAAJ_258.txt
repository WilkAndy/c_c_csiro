The observations were conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder at frequencies from 1.2 to 1.4 GHz. A set of 20 bursts, of which four were short GRBs, were followed up with a typical latency of about 1 min, for a duration of up to 11 h after the burst. The data were searched using 4096 dispersion measure trials up to a maximum dispersion measure of 3763\u2009pc\u2009cm\u22123, and for pulse widths w over a range of duration from 1.256 to 40.48\u2009ms. No associated pulsed radio emission was observed above  for any of the 20 GRBs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:eI34FqJmdUoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12291717526469428459", "cites_id": ["12291717526469428459"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/497/1/125/5867782", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:60SnTPfzlKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
