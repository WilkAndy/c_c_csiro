These follow-up observations are part of a multiwavelength campaign to study the properties and frequency of tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) in group environments. Based on the calculated gas-phase metallicity and redshift, in addition to the previously measured H\u2009i and stellar properties, we have confirmed the tidal origins of TDG candidate AGC 208457, which has emerged from the tidal debris of an interaction between the NGC 3166/9 galaxy pair. By comparing H\u2009i and optical recessional velocities, we have also confirmed a physical association of the gaseous knots and star clusters embedded in the metal-rich tidal tail of NGC 4747."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3379390864017553496", "cites_id": ["3379390864017553496"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/480/2/2719/5062816", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WHj3BhYC5i4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
