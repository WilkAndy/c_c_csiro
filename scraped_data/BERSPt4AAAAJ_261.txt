The                     environments of IMBHs remain unknown, however, the proposed candidates include                     the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Evidence at optical                     wavelengths points at HLX-1 being the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Here                     we report the Australia Telescope Compact Array radio observations of                         H\u2009i emission in and around ESO 243\u221249 searching for signatures of a                     recent merger event. No H\u2009i line emission is detected in ESO 243\u221249                     with a 5\u03c3 upper limit on the H\u2009i gas mass of a few                         108\u2009M\u2299. A likely reason for this non-detection is the                     cluster environment depleting ESO 243\u221249's H\u2009i gas reservoir.
