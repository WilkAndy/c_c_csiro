This survey is expected to eventually catalog at least ten thousand galaxies, about 30% of which either were previously uncataloged or had no velocity measurement. The``HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog\" will contain the thousand HI brightest galaxies; a preliminary set of 700 is presented here. Most of the cataloged HI sources can be identified with individual galaxies, but some correspond to pairs/groups where one or several galaxies as well as tidal tails/bridges contribute to the HI emission. We found 60 previously uncataloged galaxies, 33 of which lie in the Zone of Avoidance (| b|< 5 o; see Henning et al. 2000). Several sources outside the Zone of Avoidance have no obvious optical counterparts in the Digitized Sky Survey."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13627139050871933295", "cites_id": ["13627139050871933295"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2001ASPC..240..439K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b0kTYMRSHb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
