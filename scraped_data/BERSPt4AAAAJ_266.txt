CO emission is detected from 23 out of the 64 galaxies. Our sample includes dwarf, spiral, and elliptical galaxies with stellar masses of M star\u223c 10 6.3\u2212 11.6 M\u2299. The achieved beam size and sensitivity are 15''\u00d7 8''and\u223c 12 mJy beam\u2212 1 at the velocity resolution of\u223c 10 km s\u2212 1, respectively. We study the cold gas (molecular and atomic gas) properties of 38 subsamples with M star> 10 9 M\u2299 combined with literature H i data. We find that (1) the low star formation (SF) activity in the Fornax galaxies is caused by the decrease in the cold gas mass fraction with respect to stellar mass (hereafter, gas fraction) rather than the decrease of the SF efficiency from the cold gas;(2) the atomic gas fraction is more heavily reduced than the molecular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10433751667299377748", "cites_id": ["10433751667299377748"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac983b/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VOIEbNwhzJAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 6}}
