Our targets were selected from the 2-Jy sample, a flux-limited survey of the southern radio sky with extensive multiwavelength follow-up. Two sources were detected in H\u2009i absorption including a new detection towards the bright Fanaroff\u2013Riley Type II radio galaxy PKS\u20090409\u221275 at a redshift of  = 0.674. The H\u2009i absorption line is blueshifted by \u223c3300 km\u2009s\u22121 compared to the optical redshift of the host galaxy of PKS\u20090409\u221275 at  = 0.693. Deep optical imaging and spectroscopic follow-up with the GMOS instrument on the Gemini-South telescope reveal that the H\u2009i absorption is associated with a galaxy in front of the southern radio lobe with a stellar mass of 3.2\u20136.8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299, a star formation rate of \u223c1.24 M\u2299\u2009yr \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:bVQMTfhMCi4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9756372665616123997", "cites_id": ["9756372665616123997"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/509/2/1690/6409829", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XUhhdj-ZZYcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
