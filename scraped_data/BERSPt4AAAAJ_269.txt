The total number of detected H\u2009i sources is 55, of which 12 are background galaxies not associated with the Eridanus supergroup. Two massive H\u2009i clouds are identified and large H\u2009i debris fields are seen in the NGC 1359 interacting galaxy pair, and the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 1385. We describe the data products from the source finding algorithm and present the basic parameters. The presence of distorted H\u2009i morphology in all detected galaxies suggests ongoing tidal interactions within the subgroups. The Eridanus group has a large fraction of H\u2009i-deficient galaxies as compared to previously studied galaxy groups. These H\u2009i-deficient galaxies are not found at the centre \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:FsLZdJ3BAzkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17579311560755024426", "cites_id": ["17579311560755024426"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/2/2300/6346561", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KpK4rrlC9vMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
