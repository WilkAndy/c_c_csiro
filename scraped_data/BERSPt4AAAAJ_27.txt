Radio continuum flux densities at one or both frequencies were obtained for 10 sources and upper limits for 20; four sources are found to be thermal emitters on the basis of the observed spectral index. Five sources are classified as nonthermal. One source could not be classified."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11114628867081074966", "cites_id": ["11114628867081074966"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/304096/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FnmrGBEYP5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 9, "1999": 12, "2000": 10, "2001": 12, "2002": 11, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
