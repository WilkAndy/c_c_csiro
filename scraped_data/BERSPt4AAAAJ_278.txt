The Eridanus supergroup is composed of three sub-groups in the process of merging to form a cluster. The main focus of this study is the Eridanus (or NGC 1395) sub-group. The baryonic specific angular momentum \u2013 baryonic mass (jb\u2212Mb) relation for the Eridanus galaxies is observed to be an unbroken power law of the form , with a scatter of \u223c0.10 \u00b1 0.01 dex, consistent with previous works. We examine the relation between the atomic gas fraction, fatm, and the integrated atomic disc stability parameter q (the fatm\u2212q relation), and find that the Eridanus galaxies deviate significantly from the relation owing to environmental processes such as tidal interactions and ram pressure affecting their H\u2009i \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:rCNdntzdTkkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8759654116875049475", "cites_id": ["8759654116875049475"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/2/2949/6348109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AxqgNwKLkHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
