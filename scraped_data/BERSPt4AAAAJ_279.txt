This catalogue covers an area of \u223c144 deg2 at angular resolutions from 45 arcsec to \u223c3 arcmin. We find 6434 discrete radio sources in total, of which 3789 are detected at two or more radio frequencies. We estimate the median spectral index (\u03b1; where Sv \u223c \u03bd\u03b1) of \u03b1 = \u22120.89 and mean of \u22120.88 \u00b1 0.48 for 3636 sources detected exclusively at two frequencies (0.843 and 1.384 GHz) with similar resolution [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) \u223c40\u201345 arcsec]. The large frequency range of the surveys makes it an effective tool to investigate Gigahertz Peak Spectrum (GPS), Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS), and Infrared Faint Radio Source (IFRS) populations within our sample.
