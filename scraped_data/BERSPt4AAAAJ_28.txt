A sample of 12 stars comprising six Wolf-Rayet stars, three B hypergiants, two Of stars, and one luminous blue variable has been observed at 8.64 GHz and 4.80 0Hz. Eleven objects have been detected at 8.64 GHz and seven at 4.80 0Hz, respectively. All objects except the luminous blue variable HD 168625 were unresolved at an angular resolution of 1\", as expected if the radio flux originates in dense, ionized stellar winds. HD 168625 is clearly resolved; we detect an incomplete circumstellar ring whose morphology is rather similar to the H\u03b1 morphology of the nebula discovered by Hutsm\u00e9kers et al."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 140, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4763399000402999587", "cites_id": ["4763399000402999587"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995ApJ...450..289L", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I7l4Pif-GkIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 8, "1997": 5, "1998": 7, "1999": 9, "2000": 7, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 8, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
