The space density of HI clouds is therefore about 1/1000th that of galaxies with the same MHI."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1183093007483286089", "cites_id": ["1183093007483286089"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/h-i-tidal-tails-bridges-and-clouds/163271ACD315CA8A9455A7B978A6DD62", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:STJKb9IwaxAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
