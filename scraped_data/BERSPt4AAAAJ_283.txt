MOA is a collaboration of approximately 30 astronomers from New Zealand and Japan established with the aim of finding and detecting microlensing events towards the Magellanic Clouds and the Galactic bulge, which may be indicative of either dark matter or of planetary companions. The observing program commenced in 1995, using very wide band blue and red filters and a nine-chip mosaic CCD camera.As a by-product of these observations a large database of CCD photometry for 1.4 million stars towards both LMC and SMC has been established. In one preliminary analysis 576 bright variable stars were confirmed, nearly half of them being Cepheids. Another analysis has identified large numbers of blue variables, and 205 eclipsing binaries are included in this sample. In addition 351 red variables (AGB stars) have been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17672547229959649609", "cites_id": ["17672547229959649609"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/photometry-of-pulsating-stars-in-the-magellanic-clouds-as-observed-in-the-moa-project/85F5FE602381AE0514C104D3C3B74626", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SfkOjhKAQfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1}}
