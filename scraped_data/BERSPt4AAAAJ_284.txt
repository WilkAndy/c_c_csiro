Here we present a brief overview of such studies against the nuclear region of starburst galaxies. The high angular resolution provided by synthesis telescopes allows us to resolve the central region of nearby galaxies and thus investigate the gas kinematics close to the nucleus. The detection of fast-rotating nuclear rings is related to the bars in these galaxies which in turn might have been triggered by tidal galaxy-galaxy interactions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17344622664138945286", "cites_id": ["17344622664138945286"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/hi-absorption-as-a-tracer-of-nuclear-rings-in-galaxies/A789A536493A80A18DDA3A4AC6270E28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BvMw02p6tPAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
