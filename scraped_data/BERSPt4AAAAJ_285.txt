Using ASKAP observations, we studied the H\u2009i absorption spectrum from gas clouds along the line of sight and thereby constrained the distance to the source. The maximum negative radial velocities measured from the H\u2009i absorption spectra for MAXI J1535\u2013571 and an extragalactic source in the same field of view are \u221269 \u00b1 4 and \u221289 \u00b1 4\u2009km\u2009s\u22121, respectively. This rules out the far kinematic distance (\u2009kpc), giving a most likely distance of \u2009kpc, with a strong upper limit of the tangent point at \u2009kpc. At our preferred distance, the peak unabsorbed luminosity of MAXI J1535\u2013571 was >78 per\u2009cent of the Eddington luminosity, and shows that the soft-to-hard spectral state transition occurred at the very \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10277545945191068031", "cites_id": ["10277545945191068031"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/488/1/L129/5532374", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f7HemZUtoY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
