We present the first Chandra ACIS-I X-ray image and spectra of this dense, exotic object, accompanied by a deep centimeter-wavelength Australia Telescope Compact Array radio image at similar\u2272 1 &arcsec; spatial resolution and Hubble Space Telescope/ground-based optical data. At the S/N> 3 level, Chandra detects several hundred X-ray point sources (compared to the three distinct sources seen by ROSAT). At least 40 of these sources are definitely associated with optically identified cluster O-and WR\u2013type members, but most are not. A diffuse X-ray component is also seen out to\u223c 2 &arcmin;(4 pc) from the center, probably arising mainly from the large number of merging/colliding hot stellar winds and/or numerous faint cluster sources. The point-source X-ray fluxes generally increase with increasing bolometric brightnesses of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9987272785564796548", "cites_id": ["9987272785564796548"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/340491/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hAaEAq_rmYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 13, "2004": 10, "2005": 11, "2006": 13, "2007": 8, "2008": 10, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 17, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
