Using ASKAP subarrays available during its commissioning phase, DINGO early science data were taken over \u223c60 deg2 of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) 23 h region with 35.5 h integration time. We make direct detections of six known and one new sources at z < 0.01. Using \u2009i spectral stacking, we investigate the \u2009i gas content of galaxies at 0.04 < z < 0.09 for different galaxy colours. The results show that galaxy morphology based on optical colour is strongly linked to \u2009i gas properties. To examine environmental impacts on the i gas content of galaxies, three subsamples are made based on the GAMA group catalogue. The average i mass of group central galaxies is larger than those of satellite and isolated galaxies, but with a lower i \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:WzTVkKNmPSkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4939107076900709580", "cites_id": ["4939107076900709580"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/518/3/4646/6775116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zORIyrc7i0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
