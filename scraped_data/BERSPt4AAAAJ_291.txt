We carried out a Gaussian spectral decomposition and stacking methods to identify the cold neutral medium (CNM) and the warm neutral medium (WNM) of the H\u2009i gas. We found that 30% of the total H\u2009i gas, which corresponds to a mass of \u223c107 M\u2299, is in the CNM phase. The distribution of the H\u2009i in KK\u200969 is not symmetric. Our GMRT H\u2009i intensity map of KK\u200969 overlaid onto a Hubble Space Telescope image reveals an offset of \u223c4 kpc between the H\u2009i high-density region and the stellar body, indicating it may be a dwarf transitional galaxy. The offset, along with the potential truncation of the H\u2009i body, are evidence of interaction with the central group spiral galaxy NGC\u20092683, indicating the H\u2009i gas is being stripped from KK\u200969 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:AZju0d2GQJ0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2533525901681984011", "cites_id": ["2533525901681984011"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-020-03825-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C4IBZ2LkKCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
