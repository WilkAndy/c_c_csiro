I highlight the giant 2X-Hi disks of nearby galaxies (M 83, NGC 3621, and NGC 1512), studied as part of the Local Volume Hi Survey (LVHIS), their kinematics and relation to XUV disks, signatures of tidal interactions and accretion events, the MHI - DHI relation as well as the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies. - Using multi-wavelength data, I create 3D visualisations of the gas and stars in galaxies, with the shape of their warped disks obtained through kinematic modelling of their Hi velocity fields."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12063700524598892158", "cites_id": ["12063700524598892158"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/2xhi-disks-of-spiral-galaxies/92362C01A55CC863DF4ECDB3CDE0E983", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fhZp_bXfaqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
