This ZOA survey finds new HI galaxies which lie hidden behind the Milky Way, and also provides redshifts for partially\u2010obscured galaxies known at other wavelengths. Two precursor regions which straddle the Galactic plane have been observed to date, totalling 140 square degrees, with 72 HI galaxies detected. Detections through the inner Galaxy generally have no cataloged counterparts in any other waveband, due to the heavy extinction and stellar confusion. Detections through the outer Galaxy are more likely to have 2MASS counterparts, and we provide redshifts for these galaxies. A third region, through the Taurus molecular cloud, has also been observed.
