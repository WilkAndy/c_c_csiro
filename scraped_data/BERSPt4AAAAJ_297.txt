The workshop participants highlighted current Australian research on both theoretical and observational aspects of galaxy groups. These proceedings include short one-page summaries of a number of the talks presented at the workshop. The talks presented ranged from reconciling N-body simulations with observations, to the Hi content of galaxies in groups and the existence of 'dark galaxies'. The formation and existence of ultra-compact dwarfs in groups, and a new supergroup in Eridanus were also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14398061801737664763", "cites_id": ["14398061801737664763"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AS/AS05030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-7ixquww0McJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
