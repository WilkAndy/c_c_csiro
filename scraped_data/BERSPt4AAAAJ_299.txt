Star formation occurs all along the arms, which extend over more than 100 kpc. The galaxy experiences tidal perturbations from the nearby companion IC 4970 passing by on a low-inclination, prograde orbit. We have mapped the large-scale distribution and kinematics of the atomic gas (HI) in the NGC 6872/IC 4970 system and carried out N-body simulations with stars and gas. HI is absent from the central region; on the other hand, large gas concentrations are found at the tip of the tidal arms, spatially coincident with the blue stellar clusters and with the peaks of the H\u03b1 distribution. We use that remarkable system to investigate the evolution of gas and stars in a close prograde encounter, examine the influence of a dark matter halo on the length of the tidal tails, and test models of collisionally induced star formation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12198328389267559049", "cites_id": ["12198328389267559049"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/stars-and-gas-in-the-large-interacting-galaxy-ngc-6872/EA96EF18A0194513FF59377237CFEFFA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iRLbXworSakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
