ANGST is a systematic Hubble Space Telescope survey to establish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (D\u2272 4 Mpc). VLA-ANGST provides VLA H i observations of the sub-sample of ANGST galaxies with recent star formation that are observable from the northern hemisphere and that were not observed in the \u201cThe H i Nearby Galaxy Survey\u201d(THINGS).
