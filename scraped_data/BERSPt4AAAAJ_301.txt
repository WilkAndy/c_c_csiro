The absorption line consists of three components separated in both location as well as velocity. We derive HI column densities of \u223c2\u00d71022 cm\u22122 assuming a gas spin temperature of 100 K. For the first time we are able to reliably estimate the HI cloud sizes (\u224815 pc) and atomic gas densities (\u2248200 cm\u22123). Our results suggest that the HI gas is not associated with the <10 pc region which presumably contains the H2O masers, but it is more distant from the nucleus, and is probably associated with the r\u223c1 kpc gas seen in CO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12055011567046448742", "cites_id": ["12055011567046448742"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647399000718", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZlYHaSYBTKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
