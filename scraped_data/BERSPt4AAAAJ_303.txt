The peculiarity of its nuclear region has first been mentioned by Morgan (1958) who identified numerous, extremely brilliant, small nuclei in the central region which he called \u201chot spots\u201d. A real-colour image of this most interesting and unusual central region has been presented in The Messenger by V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (1983). This image nicely demonstrates the presence of several very blue \u201chot spots\u201d, corresponding to bright H ll re-gions, and of a reddish nucleus which shows spectroscopic evidence for the presence of Seyfert activity (V\u00e9ron-Cetty 8. V\u00e9ron 1985)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12988312042982498711", "cites_id": ["12988312042982498711"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993Msngr..71...37K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l2Hm8fzAP7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
