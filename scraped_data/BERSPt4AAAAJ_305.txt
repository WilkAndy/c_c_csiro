These observations were carried out as part of a pilot survey for the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in H\u2009i (FLASH). From a sample of 326 radio sources with 855.5\u2009MHz peak flux density above 10\u2009mJy, we detected two associated H\u2009i absorption systems, in SDSS\u2009J090331+010847 at z = 0.522 and SDSS\u2009J113622+004852 at z = 0.563. Both galaxies are massive (stellar mass ) and have optical spectra characteristic of luminous red galaxies, though spectral energy distribution fitting implies that SDSS\u2009J113622+004852 contains a dust-obscured starburst with star formation rate \u223c69\u2009M\u2299\u2009yr\u22121. The H\u2009i absorption lines have a high optical depth, with \u03c4pk of 1.77 \u00b1 0.16 for SDSS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:XAp-VaTZjjwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14641635593690848634", "cites_id": ["14641635593690848634"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/2/2947/6671552", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ep2obP-JMcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
