The small distance to the galaxy (\u223c28.5 Mpc) allows us to resolve portions of the jets to examine their structure. We combine multiwavelength data: radio observations by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), and X-ray data from Chandra, Swift, and SRG/eROSITA. We present intensity, rotation measure, polarization, spectral index, and X-ray environment maps. Regions of the southern jet show simultaneous narrowing and brightening, which can be interpreted as a signature of the recollimation of the jet by external, environmental pressure, though it is also consistent with intermittent active galactic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:vnF2_uLGgtgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=31292133352766421", "cites_id": ["31292133352766421"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/2/1865/6692930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1XvBjAcsbwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
