This is the first CO imaging survey for loose galaxy groups. We obtained well-resolved CO data (\u223c 0.7\u20131.5 kpc) for a total of 16 galaxies in two environments. By comparing our ACA CO data with the H i and UV data, we probe the impacts of the group environment on the cold gas components (CO and H i gas) and star formation activity. We find that CO and/or H i morphologies are disturbed in our group members, some of which show highly asymmetric CO distributions (eg, IC 5264, NGC 7421, and NGC 7418). In comparison with isolated galaxies in the xCOLD GASS sample, our group galaxies tend to have low star formation rates and low H 2 gas fractions. Our findings suggest that the group environment can change the distribution of cold gas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:XDrR66g3YHsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14490165047552208301", "cites_id": ["14490165047552208301"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac7eba/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rW0hrFZoF8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
