We find a large amount of halo gas, previously missed by H\u2009i observations, accounting for 6.8\u2009per cent of the total H\u2009i mass. This is most likely gas blown into the halo by star formation. Our maps go down to a 3\u03c3 column density level of 5 \u00d7 1018\u2009cm\u22122. We model the H\u2009i distribution using tilted-ring fitting techniques and find a warp on the galaxy\u2019s approaching and receding sides. The H\u2009i in the northern side of the galaxy appears to be suppressed. This may be the result of ionization by the starburst activity in the galaxy, as suggested by a previous study. The origin of the warp is unclear but could be due to past interactions or ram pressure stripping. Broad, asymmetric H\u2009i absorption lines extending throughout the H\u2009i emission velocity channels are present towards the nuclear region \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Y9VhQm-5nPIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9439511214965667516", "cites_id": ["9439511214965667516"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/2/2019/6564747", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vDZY9W_h_4IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
