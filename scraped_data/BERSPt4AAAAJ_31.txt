The HIPASS catalogue (HICAT), containing 4315 H i-selected galaxies from the region south of declination +2\u00b0, is presented in Meyer et al. (Paper I). This paper describes in detail the completeness and reliability of HICAT, which are calculated from the recovery rate of synthetic sources and follow-up observations, respectively. HICAT is found to be 99 per cent complete at a peak flux of 84 mJy and an integrated flux of 9.4 Jy km s \u22121. The overall reliability is 95 per cent, but rises to 99 per cent for sources with peak fluxes >58 mJy or integrated flux >8.2 Jy km s \u22121. Expressions are derived for the uncertainties on the most important HICAT parameters: peak flux, integrated flux, velocity width and recessional velocity. The errors on HICAT parameters are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 135, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9740508141844906527", "cites_id": ["9740508141844906527"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/350/4/1210/985869", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H0J3Low8LYcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 14, "2006": 5, "2007": 14, "2008": 8, "2009": 14, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
