This first data release consists of Hi observations of three fields in the direction of the Hydra and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 galaxy group. In this paper, we describe how we generate and publicly release flat-disk tilted-ring kinematic models for 109/592 unique Hi detections in these fields. The modelling method adopted here\u2014which we call the WALLABY Kinematic Analysis Proto-Pipeline (WKAPP) and for which the corresponding scripts are also publicly available\u2014consists of combining results from the homogeneous application of the FAT and 3DBarolo algorithms to the subset of 209 detections with sufficient resolution and in order to generate optimised model parameters and uncertainties. The 109 models presented here tend to be gas rich detections resolved by at least 3\u20134 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:txeM2kYbVNMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5344461925539603529", "cites_id": ["5344461925539603529"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/wallaby-pilot-survey-public-release-of-hi-kinematic-models-for-more-than-100-galaxies-from-phase-1-of-askap-pilot-observations/DD35C419A062DB1322F1307A660C52E4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SWRjG85XK0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
