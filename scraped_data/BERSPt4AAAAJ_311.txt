We use data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope to train a self-organizing map (SOM). The radio maps from three ASKAP surveys, Evolutionary Map of Universe pilot survey (EMU-PS), Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins pilot survey (DINGO), and Survey With ASKAP of GAMA-09 + X-ray (SWAG-X), are used to search for the rarest or unknown radio morphologies. We use an extension of the SOM algorithm that implements rotation and flipping invariance on astronomical sources. The SOM is trained using the images of all \u2018complex\u2019 radio sources in the EMU-PS which we define as all sources catalogued as \u2018multi-component\u2019. The trained SOM is then used to estimate a similarity score for complex sources in all surveys. We select 0.5% of the sources that are most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:uUvzmPk0f8oC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4517069020215749638", "cites_id": ["4517069020215749638"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/discovery-of-peculiar-radio-morphologies-with-askap-using-unsupervised-machine-learning/ACB0DFCE426EFAFBCEEBB5652A7087C1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BqzhZ1farz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
