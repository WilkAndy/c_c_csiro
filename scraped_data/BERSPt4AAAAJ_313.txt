These two H i clouds were recently discovered using the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Two low surface brightness optical counterparts to one of these H i clouds are identified in the new Gemini data that reaches down to magnitudes of\u223c 27.5 mag in the g-band. The observed H i mass-to-light ratio derived with these new data, , is among the highest reported to date. We are also able to rule out that the two H i clouds are dwarf companions of IC 5270. Tidal interactions and ram pressure stripping are plausible explanations for the physical origin of these two clouds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16914078516775279959", "cites_id": ["16914078516775279959"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aaaa1d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V91038vguuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
