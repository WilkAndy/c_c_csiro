The method builds on the 3D Tilted Ring Fitting Code (TiRiFiC, ascl: 1208.008). FAT accurately models the kinematics and the morphologies of galaxies with an extent of eight beams across the major axis in the inclination range 20-90 without the need for priors such as disc inclination. FAT's performance allows us to model the gas kinematics of many thousands of well-resolved galaxies, which is essential for future HI surveys, with the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1810522186016392077", "cites_id": ["1810522186016392077"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ascl.soft07011K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jYN461VEIBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
