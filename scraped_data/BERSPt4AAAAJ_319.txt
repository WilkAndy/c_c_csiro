Although there are quantitative discrepancies, the qualitative behaviour of the wind efficiency with effective temperature appears to be in line with theoretical predictions. Observations of new cases are fundamental to confirm these results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11350719242171111643", "cites_id": ["11350719242171111643"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paula-Benaglia/publication/234181305_Radio_study_on_the_mass_loss_bi-stability_jump/links/55e4347908ae6abe6e8e992e/Radio-study-on-the-mass-loss-bi-stability-jump.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:29jMFgPbhZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2}}
