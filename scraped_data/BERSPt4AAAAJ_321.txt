These outstanding images truly reveal the real mass distributions of the galaxies with much less dust extinction. We present the results of the K-band surface photometry for NGC 253 and M83. We also obtained an HI mosaic image of M 83, covering 66'X 66'. The HI distribution is enormous and very complex. It shows rings and several finger or arc structures outside the Holmberg radius implying its active dynamical evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2027599904685366164", "cites_id": ["2027599904685366164"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2001ASPC..230..109P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lBtj4V57IxwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
