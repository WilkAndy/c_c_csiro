These galaxies are used to map out the distribution of filaments and voids out to 10000 km/s. A preliminary measurement of the galaxy overdensity suggests only a moderate overdensity is present, and that the excess mass (above the background density) is ~2.10^{15}.Omega.M(sun). This is below the mass predicted in POTENT reconstructions of the local velocity field, and implies that the `Great Attractor' (GA) is not as massive as these reconstructions indicate, or does not lie hidden in the region investigated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15140169947209883047", "cites_id": ["15140169947209883047"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p1191lmwHNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
