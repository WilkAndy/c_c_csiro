This collaboration between the CRAFT and WALLABY survey teams marks the fifth, and most distant, FRB host galaxy detected in H i, not including the Milky Way. We find that W13\u201318 has an H i mass of M HI= 6.5\u00d7 10 9 M\u2299, an H i-to-stellar mass ratio of 2.17, and coincides with a continuum radio source of flux density at 1.4 GHz of 1.3 mJy. The H i global spectrum of W13\u201318 appears to be asymmetric, albeit the H i observation has a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and the galaxy itself appears modestly undisturbed. These properties are compared to the early literature of H i emission detected in other FRB hosts to date, where either the H i global spectra were strongly asymmetric, or there were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:oqD4_j7ulsYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6847127620836454698", "cites_id": ["6847127620836454698"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acc1e3/meta", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
