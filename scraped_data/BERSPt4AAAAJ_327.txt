We find that the sizes and morphologies of the internal shocks resemble remarkably well those of the newly detected class of odd radio circles (ORCs). This would highlight a so-far overlooked mechanism to form radio rings, shells, and even more complex structures around elliptical galaxies. Mach numbers of = 2\u20133 for such internal shocks are in agreement with the spectral indices of the observed ORCs. We estimate that\u223c 5% of galaxies could undergo merger events, which occasionally lead to such prominent structures within the galactic halo during their lifetime, explaining the low number of observed ORCs. At the time when the shock structures are matching the physical sizes of the observed ORCs, the central galaxies are typically classified as early-type galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:i_7YvbSbtFEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=752013655833289030", "cites_id": ["752013655833289030"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acb5f5/meta", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
