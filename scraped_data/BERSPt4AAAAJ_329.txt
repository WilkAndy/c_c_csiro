We compare the H\u2009i properties of galaxy pair candidates in the Hydra I and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 group, with those of non-paired control galaxies selected in the same fields. We perform H\u2009i profile decomposition of the sample galaxies using a tool, baygaud, which allows us to deblend a line-of-sight velocity profile with an optimal number of Gaussian components. We construct H\u2009i superprofiles of the sample galaxies via stacking of their line profiles after aligning the central velocities. We fit a double Gaussian model to the superprofiles and classify them as kinematically narrow and broad components with respect to their velocity dispersions. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational instability of H\u2009i gas discs of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:hHIA4WEVY-EC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15783908307429823204", "cites_id": ["15783908307429823204"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/519/1/318/6849980", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5BKxl_q0C9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
