The galaxy resolves into stars in images with Hubble Space Telescope, leading to a distance estimate of 6.8 \u00b1 0.7\u2009Mpc. Spectral optical observations with the Southern African Large Telescope reveal HIPASS J1131-31 to be one of the most extremely metal-poor galaxies known with the gas-phase oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H)  = 6.99 \u00b1 0.16\u2009dex via the direct [O\u2009iii] 4363 line method and 6.87 \u00b1 0.07\u2009dex from the two strong line empirical methods. The red giant branch of the system is tenuous compared with the prominence of the features of young populations in the colour-magnitude diagram, inviting speculation that star formation in the galaxy only began in the last few Gyr."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:GYcXSSpN504C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15487942109681653540", "cites_id": ["15487942109681653540"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/518/4/5893/6825465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JJdjRUo58NYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
