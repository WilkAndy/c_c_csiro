We detect 9461 sources at 1.37 GHz down to a flux density limit of mJy at resolution with a median root mean square of 0.05 mJy beam . We find that the flux scale is accurate to within 5 % (compared to NVSS at 1.4 GHz). We then determine the global properties of eight Eridanus supergroup members, which are detected in both radio continuum and neutral hydrogen (HI) emission, and find that the radio-derived star formation rates (SFRs) agree well with previous literature. Using our global and resolved radio continuum properties of the nearby Eridanus galaxies, we measure and extend the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) to lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ukw-9cB-YDkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1244002080311088570", "cites_id": ["1244002080311088570"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/wallaby-prepilot-survey-radio-continuum-properties-of-the-eridanus-supergroup/36FF28BC35F724A405DFC542B9D84104", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
