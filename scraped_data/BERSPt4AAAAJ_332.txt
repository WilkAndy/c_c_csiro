OH masers at 18\u2009cm offer an effective way to probe their circumstellar environment. In this work, we present the discovery of seven OH maser sources likely associated with such evolved stars from the visual inspection of Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) continuum images. These seven sources do not emit real continuum emission, but the high sensitivity of our images allows us to detect their maser emission, resembling continuum sources. To confirm their nature, we carried out spectral-line observations with ATCA. All the sources showed the double-peaked spectra at 1612\u2009MHz, typical of evolved stars. The detection of maser emission in continuum images can be a complementary and easy-to-use method to discover new maser sources \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:U0iAMwwPxtsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11803961369678668779", "cites_id": ["11803961369678668779"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/512/1/L21/6534259", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:62MhXlMY0KMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
