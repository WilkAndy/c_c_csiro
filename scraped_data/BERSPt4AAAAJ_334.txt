Following observational works, we classify the simulated galaxies by their disc surface brightness profiles into single exponential (Type I), truncated (Type II), and antitruncated (Type III) profiles. In agreement with previous observation and theoretical work, we find that Type II discs result from truncated star-forming discs that drive radial gradients in the stellar populations. In contrast, Type III profiles result from galaxy mergers, extended star-forming discs or the late formation of a steeper, inner disc. We find that the EAGLE simulations qualitatively reproduce the observed trends found between profile type frequency and galaxy mass, morphology and environment, such as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:RMgMIBzvq-4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10460924241729113410", "cites_id": ["10460924241729113410"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/509/1/261/6400114", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qk2JaiyrLJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
