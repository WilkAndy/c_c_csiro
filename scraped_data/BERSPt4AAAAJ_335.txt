In particular, the formation and evolution of galaxies, including our own, are a wide field of research. Three dimensional (spatial 3D) scientific visualisation is typically limited to simulated galaxies, due to the inherently two dimensional spatial resolution of Earth-based observations. However, with appropriate means of reconstruction, such visualisation can also be used to bring out the inherent 3D structure that exists in 2D observations of known galaxies, providing new views of these galaxies and visually illustrating the spatial relationships within galaxy groups that are not obvious in 2D. We present a novel approach to reconstruct and visualise 3D representations of nearby galaxies based on observational data using the scientific visualisation software Splotch. We apply our approach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:jlhcAiayVhoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14424808279081075111", "cites_id": ["14424808279081075111"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133721000020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p8G9M7Q2L8gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
