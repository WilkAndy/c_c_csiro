During the refereeing process we improved some of the TiRiFiC models (more consistent definition of galaxies\u2019\u2018central parts\u2019, within which position angle and inclination are kept constant). This affected Figures 3, 4, 6 and 7 as well as Tables 3 and 4. While the Figures were updated to reflect the changes, the Tables were not, so we publish here the correct versions. This did not affect our analysis and our conclusions remain unchanged. Inclination and position angle profiles found with TiRiFiC are used to measure radial stellar mass and Hi mass profiles in cocentric annuli. Furthermore they are used to measure the average radial Hi column density profile, from which the Hi radius RH I is measured. RH I has not been updated in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6510795043328010830", "cites_id": ["6510795043328010830"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/484/1/832/5257852", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Tqrwopj9WloJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
