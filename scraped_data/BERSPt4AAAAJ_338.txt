C. Martin in 1998. CHIPA provides the most important parameters of nearby galaxies derived from observations of the neutral Hydrogen line. The catalogue contains information of 1400 galaxies across the sky and different morphological types. Parameters like the optical diameter of the galaxy, the blue magnitude, the distance, morphological type, HI extension are listed among others. Maps of the HI distribution, velocity and velocity dispersion can also be display for some cases. The main objective of this catalogue is to facilitate the bibliographic queries, through searching in a database accessible from the internet that will be published in 2015 (the website is under construction). The database was built using the open source \u201c mysql (SQL, Structured Query Language, management system relational database) \u201d, while the website was built with \u201c Html (Hypertext Markup Language) \u201d and \u201c PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)\u201d."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7498467317712510423", "cites_id": ["7498467317712510423"], "pub_url": "https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/handle/11336/139105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:110hAEzoD2gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
