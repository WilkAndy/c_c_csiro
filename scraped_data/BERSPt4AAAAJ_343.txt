Due to its high angular resolution it has now become possible to construct star formation histories of individual stellar populations on scales of a few arcseconds spanning a range of up to  This method will be applied to the ANGST galaxies, a large HST volume limited survey to map galaxies up to distances of 3.5\u20134.0 Mpc (excluding the Local Group). The ANGST sample is currently followed\u2010up by high, \u223c6\u2033 resolution VLA observations of neutral, atomic hydrogen (HI) in the context of VLA\u2010ANGST, an approved Large VLA Project. The VLA resolution is well matched to that of the spatially resolved star formation history maps. The combination of ANGST and VLA\u2010ANGST data will provide a new, promising approach to study essential fields of galaxy evolution such as the triggering of star formation, the feedback of massive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3518357494611430002", "cites_id": ["3518357494611430002"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2973559", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:csolE4C30zAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
