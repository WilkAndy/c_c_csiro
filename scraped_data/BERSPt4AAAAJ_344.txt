Due to its high angular resolution it has now become possible to construct star-formation histories of individual stellar populations on scales of a few arcseconds spanning a range of a several Gyr. ANGST (ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury) is an ambitious program to derive the detailed star-formation histories for a volume-filled sample of galaxies up to 4 Mpc distance (excluding the Local Group). The ANGST sample will be followed up by high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) HI observations in the context of an approved Large Project (\u223c 480 hours of allocated time). The combination of ANGST/HST and VLA data is essential to understand the triggering of star formation, the feedback of massive stars into the interstellar medium (ISM), the impact of previous episodes of star formation on the present \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13616360022700227995", "cites_id": ["13616360022700227995"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2008ASPC..395..376O", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m33gTkwH97wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
