These observations are a precursor to a large scale, extragalactic, Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) survey with the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA). The data for this survey are being taken concurrently with a Galactic survey and a pulsar survey. Full survey observations, which will begin in 2007, will reveal local large scale structure in a part of the extragalactic sky that is relatively unexplored due to the obscuration of optical light by dust in our Galaxy. One of these surveys will have an integration time of 268 seconds per point in the inner Galaxy and 134 seconds in the outer Galaxy, covering| b|< 5o, while the other will have an integration time of only 5 seconds per point, covering| b|< 10o with an rms of roughly 6 mJy. No other extragalactic ALFA survey will cover these latitudes. Precursor observations have been made using the latter observational setup on two patches of sky totaling 140 deg2 (one near l= 40o, and the other near l= 192o). We have measured HI parameters for detections from these observations, and cross-correlated with the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. A significant fraction of the objects are new, having never been detected at any wavelength. For those galaxies that have been previously detected, about half have no previously known redshift, and no previous HI detection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7502179604761690079", "cites_id": ["7502179604761690079"], "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e9b7/5cb15b4194098fa66ca54e9a368ab588d8c8.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3z8AL5oYHWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
