We will obtain detailed maps of the Hi distribution, kinematics and environment of all target galaxies, and derive their rotation curves, orientation parameters and star formation rates. By using independent distances we will be able to derive Hi mass functions and local star formation densities for the Local Volume as well as nearby galaxy groups such as the CenA and Sculptor groups. A complementary H-band survey will also allow us to analyse the (baryonic) Tully-Fisher relation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6571752948357286862", "cites_id": ["6571752948357286862"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71173-5_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zkt25nyOM1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
