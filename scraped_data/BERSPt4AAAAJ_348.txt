Galaxies which contain HI are detected by these blind surveys, and their Doppler shifted emission locates them in 3 dimensions. The first survey will be of the inner Galaxy accessible to Arecibo (l= 30-75 degrees), within 10 degrees of the Galactic equator, and will be relatively shallow (effective integration time of 8-10 seconds per beam, with rms about 6 mJy). We have completed two small regions using this observing mode (near l= 40 degrees, and l= 192 degrees). The catalog of HI detections will be presented, and future expectations for the full survey will be discussed. We will also be conducting very deep, pointed observations, with dwell times expected to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17608178126010111674", "cites_id": ["17608178126010111674"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AAS...208.5304H/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:utaiprbQXPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
