We resolve the emission into (conservatively)~ 100 stellar objects, and compare our high resolution Chandra X-ray images of the core cluster to high-resolution optical images obtained by HST. The detected sources apparently include most of the massive O stars, some WR stars (which may show evidence of emission produced in wind-wind collisions), and some surprisingly bright emission from relatively late type stars and PMS stars. We present preliminary source identifications from comparison with optical images and present a preliminary L x}/L {bol relation for the massive X-ray sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=212960285572670477", "cites_id": ["212960285572670477"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AAS...197.3815C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DSTTXECW9AIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1}}
