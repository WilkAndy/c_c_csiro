Dynamically important structures might still lie hidden in this zone. Various approaches are presently being employed to uncover the galaxy distribution in this Zone of Avoidance (ZOA). Results as well as the different limitations and selection effects from these multi-wavelengths explorations are being discussed. Galaxies beyond the innermost part of the Milky Way \u2014 typically at a foreground obscuration in the blue of A B \u2273 5m and |b| \u2272\u00b15\u00b0 \u2014 remain particularly difficult to uncover except for H i-surveys: the Galaxy is fully transparent at the 21cm line and H i-rich galaxies are easy to trace. We will report here on the first results from the systematic blind H I-search (v \u2264 12700 km s\u22121) in the southern Zone of Avoidance which is currently being conducted with the Parkes Multibeam (MB) Receiver."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6348506237407581294", "cites_id": ["6348506237407581294"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-49460-7_5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:btQHf8lsGlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
