The rotation curve rises linearly out to a radius of 7 kpc, and then appears to flatten out at 100 km s^{-1}. The HI mass out to 24.5 kpc is 6 x 10 9 M odot, or 10% of the total mass out to this radius. The colour, central surface brightness, scale height and scale length of the disk of IC 5249 are RI approx0. 4, mu R= 20.5+/-0.1 mag arcsec^{-2}, 620+/-40 pc and 12 kpc, respectively. Additional light to that predicted by an exponential disk is present at distances greater than 3 kpc from the disk. At 6 kpc the surface brightness is mu_R approx 28 mag arcsec^{-2}. The measured distribution of surface brightness in the halo is consistent, within large statistical uncertainties, with that expected for a tracer of dark matter. If the tracer consists entirely of red dwarfs with mass 0.2 M odot, then their spatial density at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=904700483412765661", "cites_id": ["904700483412765661"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999ASPC..165..187Y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Svx3UskjgwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
