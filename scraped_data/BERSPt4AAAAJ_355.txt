The aim of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) is to blindly survey the southern sky out to a velocity of 12700 km s\u22121. In this paper, we describe the parameters of the survey, summarise the current status, and present a collection of preliminary results on the Magellanic Clouds, new dwarf galaxies discovered in the Centaurus A group, and the HI mass function. These results have implications for our understanding of the population of nearby galaxies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12814511590993577764", "cites_id": ["12814511590993577764"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-49460-7_26", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JEdM12VK1rEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1}}
