In light of recent developments in the field, we re-examine this host and determine a new association confidence level of 98%. At 37 Mpc, this makes ESO 601-G036 the third closest FRB host galaxy to be identified to date and the closest to host an apparently non-repeating FRB (with an estimated repetition rate limit of < 0.011 bursts per day above 10 erg). Due to its close distance, we are able to perform detailed multi-wavelength analysis on the ESO 601-G036 system. Follow-up observations confirm ESO 601-G036 to be a typical star-forming galaxy with HI and stellar masses of log(M_HI/M_sol) ~ 9.2 and log(M_*/M_sol) = 8.64, and a star formation rate of SFR = 0.09 +/- 0.01 M_sol/yr. We detect, for the first time, a diffuse gaseous tail (log(M_HI/M_sol) ~ 8.3) extending to the south-west that suggests recent interactions, likely with the confirmed nearby companion ESO 601-G037. ESO 601-G037 is a stellar shred located to the south of ESO 601-G036 that has an arc-like morphology, is about an order of magnitude less massive, and has a lower gas metallicity that is indicative of a younger stellar population. The properties of the ESO 601-G036 system indicate an ongoing minor merger event, which is affecting the overall gaseous component of the system and the stars within ESO 601-G037. Such activity is consistent with current FRB progenitor models involving magnetars and the signs of recent interactions in other nearby FRB host galaxies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:bXQfdp6S9ecC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17960", "cites_per_year": {}}
