This has motivated their combined use to quantify morphology over the full H\u2009i disc for both H\u2009i and UV imaging. We apply galaxy morphometrics: concentration, asymmetry, gini, M20 and multimode-intensity-deviation statistics to the first moment-0 maps of the WALLABY Survey of galaxies in the hydra cluster centre. Taking advantage of this new H\u2009i survey, we apply the same morphometrics over the full H\u2009i extent on archival GALEX FUV and NUV data to explore how well H\u2009i truncated, extended ultraviolet disc (XUV) and other morphological phenomena can be captured using pipeline WALLABY data products. Extended H\u2009i and UV discs can be identified relatively straightforward from their respective concentration. Combined with WALLABY H\u2009i, even the shallowest GALEX data are sufficient to identify XUV discs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:qsWQJNntlusC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/521/1/1502/7060404", "cites_per_year": {}}
