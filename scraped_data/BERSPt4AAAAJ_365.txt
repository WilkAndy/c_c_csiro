The companion paper, Paper~I, introduced the Hydra tool and demonstrated its performance using simulated data. Here we apply Hydra to assess the performance of different source finders by analysing real observational data taken from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) Pilot Survey. EMU is a wide-field radio continuum survey whose primary goal is to make a deep (Jy/beam RMS noise), intermediate angular resolution (), 1\\,GHz survey of the entire sky south of  declination, and expecting to detect and catalogue up to 40 million sources. With the main EMU survey expected to begin in 2022 it is highly desirable to understand the performance of radio image source finder software and to identify an approach that optimises source detection capabilities. Hydra has been developed to refine this process, as well as to deliver a range of metrics and source finding data products from multiple source finders. We present the performance of the five source finders tested here in terms of their completeness and reliability statistics, their flux density and source size measurements, and an exploration of case studies to highlight finder-specific limitations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:yIeBiWEAh44C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14357", "cites_per_year": {}}
