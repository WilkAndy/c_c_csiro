The survey covers the whole Virgo cluster region from its core to one virial radius (104 deg2). The sensitivity of the survey is of f(H\u03b1) ~ 4 \u00d7 10\u221217 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (5\u03c3 detection limit) for point sources and \u03a3(H\u03b1) ~ 2 \u00d7 10\u221218 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 arcsec\u22122 (1\u03c3 detection limit at 3 arcsec resolution) for extended sources, making VESTIGE the deepest and largest blind NB survey of a nearby cluster. This paper presents the survey in all its technical aspects, including the survey design, the observing strategy, the achieved sensitivity in both the NB H\u03b1+[NII] and in the broad-band r filter used for the stellar continuum subtraction, the data reduction, calibration, and products, as well as its status after the first observing semester.
