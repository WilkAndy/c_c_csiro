We discover an atomic hydrogen (H\u2009i) absorption line associated with this BCG using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We estimate a gas column density of  atoms cm\u22122 with spin temperature, Tspin \u2264 194\u2009K, consistent with the H\u2009i properties of other early-type galaxies and cool-core cluster BCGs. The relationship between the presence of cold gas and a cluster cooling flow is unclear. Our results support the scenario that ESO 137-G006 may be a recent arrival to the cluster centre and not the original BCG. This scenario is consistent with the observed spatial alignment of the BCG\u2019s wide-angle tail radio lobes with Norma\u2019s X-ray sub-cluster and the significant line-of-sight velocity offset between the mean velocity of Norma and that of the BCG."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:SpPTWFSNUtQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/519/3/4128/6939833", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PBayn2unaXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
