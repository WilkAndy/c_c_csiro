The integrated 21-cm H\u2009i line spectra are formed in a very different manner compared to usual single-dish spectra Tully\u2013Fisher measurements. It is thus extremely important to ensure that slight differences (e.g. biases due to missing flux) are quantified and understood in order to maximise the use of the large amount of data becoming available soon. This article is based on four fields for which the data are scientifically interesting by themselves. The pilot data discussed here consist of 614 galaxy spectra at a rest wavelength of 21\u2009cm. Of these spectra, 472 are of high enough quality to be used to potentially derive distances using the Tully\u2013Fisher relation. We further restrict the sample to the 251 galaxies whose inclination is sufficiently close to edge-on. For these, we derive Tully\u2013Fisher distances using the deprojected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/519/3/4589/6825526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hu9s5J0YvtQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
