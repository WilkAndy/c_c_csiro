In this work, we present the first analysis of the galaxy morphology\u2013density relation in a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We use a convolutional neural network, trained on observed galaxies, to perform visual morphological classification of galaxies with stellar masses  in the EAGLE simulation into elliptical, lenticular and late-type (spiral/irregular) classes. We find that EAGLE reproduces both the galaxy morphology\u2013density and morphology\u2013mass relations. Using the simulations, we find three key processes that result in the observed morphology\u2013density relation: (i) transformation of disc-dominated galaxies from late-type (spiral) to lenticular galaxies through gas stripping in high-density environments, (ii) formation of lenticular galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:e84hm74t-eoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/518/4/5260/6891783", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:okgsJh3g4qkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
