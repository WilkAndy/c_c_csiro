Each antenna is 12m in diameter and is equipped with a state-of-the-art MK II phased array feed (PAF). ASKAP is designed to provide high angular and spectral resolution as well as an instantaneous large field of view (5.5 x5. 5) with 36 beams for achieving a fast survey speed (Johnston et al. 2007PASA... 24.. 174J; Hotan et al. 2014PASA... 31... 41H; McConnell et al. 2016PASA... 33... 42M). An early science program with 12 and, later, 16 MK II PAF-equipped antennas (hereafter ASKAP-12) was conducted during 2016 October to 2018 January. The observations allow us to test the automated data processing software, ASKAPSOFT, assess the data quality, and optimize our data analysis and imaging techniques."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4n0clTBhZ78C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023yCat..74895723F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
