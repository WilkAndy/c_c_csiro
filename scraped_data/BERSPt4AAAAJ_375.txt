This new sample is a significant increase to the known number of older, larger, and low surface brightness LMC SNRs. We employ a multifrequency search for each object and found possible traces of optical and occasionally X-ray emission in several of these 14 SNR candidates. One of these 14 SNR candidates (MCSNR J0522 \u2013 6543) has multifrequency properties that strongly indicate a bona fide SNR. We also investigate a sample of 20 previously suggested LMC SNR candidates and confirm the SNR nature of MCSNR J0506 \u2013 6815. We detect lower surface brightness SNR candidates which were likely formed by a combination of shock waves and strong stellar winds from massive progenitors (and possibly surrounding OB stars \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:q0uBw5dMOAkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/518/2/2574/6760016", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xUUPnMBus0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
