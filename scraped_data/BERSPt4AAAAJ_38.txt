This is a 3D challenge as the sources we wish to catalog are spread over several spatial pixels and spectral channels. While 2D searches can be applied, e.g. channel by channel, optimal searches take into account the 3-dimensional nature of the sources. In this overview I will focus on Hi 21-cm spectral line source detection in extragalactic surveys, in particular HIPASS, the Hi Parkes All-Sky Survey and WALLABY, the ASKAP Hi All-Sky Survey. I use the original HIPASS data to highlight the diversity of spectral signatures of galaxies and gaseous clouds, both in emission and absorption. Among others, I report the discovery of a 680 km s\u22121 wide Hi absorption trough in the megamaser galaxy NGC 5793. Issues such as source confusion and baseline ripples, typically encountered in single \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17280116393342927573", "cites_id": ["17280116393342927573"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/overview-on-spectral-line-source-finding-and-visualisation/0D9CFABEDC2B934886624E99D9CADA7D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1QKcRk5Oz-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 15, "2017": 24, "2018": 19, "2019": 16, "2020": 12, "2021": 6, "2022": 1}}
