This trend is likely to continue with full surveys scheduled to commence later this year. Thanks to novel Phased Array Feeds each ASKAP pointing covers around 30 square degr, making it a fast survey machine delivering high-resolution radio images of the sky. Among recent science highlights are the studies of neutral hydrogen in the Magellanic Clouds as well as nearby galaxy groups and clusters, catalogs of millions of radio continuum sources, the discovery of odd radio circles, and the localization of fast radio bursts, to name just a few. To demonstrate the ASKAP survey speed we also conducted the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) covering the whole sky south of declination +41 degr at 15 arcsec resolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:PuOEWVtPfzwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9814179/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zoYZBms-_p0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
