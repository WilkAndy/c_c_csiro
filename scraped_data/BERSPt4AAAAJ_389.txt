Revealing the 3D dynamics of HII region bubbles and their associated molecular clouds and HI envelopes is important for developing an understanding of the longstanding problem as to how stellar feedback affects the density structure and kinematics of the different phases of the interstellar medium.Methods. We employed observations of the HII region RCW 120 in the [CII] 158 \u00b5m line, observed within the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) legacy program FEEDBACK, and in the 12CO and 13CO (3\u2192 2) lines, obtained with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) to derive the physical properties of the gas in the photodissociation region (PDR) and in the molecular cloud. We used high angular resolution HI data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey to quantify the physical properties of the cold atomic gas through HI self-absorption. The high spectral resolution of the heterodyne observations turns out to be essential in order to analyze the physical conditions, geometry, and overall structure of the sources. Two types of radiative transfer models were used to fit the observed [CII] and CO spectra. A line profile analysis with the 1D non-LTE radiative transfer code SimLine proves that the CO emission cannot stem from a spherically symmetric molecular cloud configuration. With a two-layer multicomponent model, we then quantified the amount of warm background and cold foreground gas. To fully exploit the spectral-spatial information in the CO spectra, a Gaussian mixture model was introduced that allows for grouping spectra into clusters with similar properties. Results. The CO emission arises mostly from a limb \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:KTwcwpFFj4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/hemhyp2mvzc5dfrmuyu232skxi/access/wayback/https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/forth/aa42575-21.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jIGQu5EODQEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
