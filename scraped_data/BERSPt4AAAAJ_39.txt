Taipan will use the newly refurbished 1.2-m UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the new TAIPAN instrument, which includes an innovative \u2018Starbugs\u2019 positioning system capable of rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres (and up to 300 with a proposed upgrade) over the 6\u00b0 diameter focal plane, and a purpose-built spectrograph operating in the range from 370 to 870 nm with resolving power R \u2273 2000. The main scientific goals of Taipan are (i) to measure the distance scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H0) to 1% precision, and the growth rate of structure to 5%; (ii) to make the most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ziOE8S1-AIUC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=985218034707934757", "cites_id": ["985218034707934757"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/taipan-galaxy-survey-scientific-goals-and-observing-strategy/459B76832045EDA0740E8E7BF4D5D849", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JS4TKZUyrA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 32, "2019": 25, "2020": 28, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
