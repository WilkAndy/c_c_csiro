Our targets were selected from the 2-Jy sample, a flux-limited survey of the southern radio sky with extensive multi-wavelength follow-up. Two sources were detected in H absorption including a new detection towards the bright FRII radio galaxy PKS 0409\u2212 75 at a redshift of \ud835\udc67= 0.674. The H absorption line is blueshifted by\u223c 3300 km s\u2212 1 compared to the optical redshift of the host galaxy of PKS 0409\u2212 75 at \ud835\udc67= 0.693. Deep optical imaging and spectroscopic follow-up with the GMOS instrument on the Gemini-South telescope reveal that the H absorption is associated with a galaxy in front of the southern radio lobe with a stellar mass of 3.2\u2212 6.8\u00d7 1011\ud835\udc40\u2299, a star-formation rate of\u223c 1.24 \ud835\udc40\u2299 yr\u2212 1 and an estimated H column density of 2.16\u00d7 1021 cm\u2212 2, assuming a spin temperature of \ud835\udc47spin= 500 K and source covering factor of \ud835\udc36f= 0.3. Using polarisation measurements of PKS 0409\u2212 75 from the literature we estimate the magnetic field of the absorbing galaxy to be\u223c 14.5 \ud835\udf07G, consistent with field strengths observed in nearby spiral galaxies, but larger than expected for an elliptical galaxy. Results from this pilot study can inform future surveys as new wide-field telescopes allow us to search for 21-cm H absorption towards all bright radio sources as opposed to smaller targeted samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amit-Seta-2/publication/355423952_HI_absorption_at_z07_against_the_lobe_of_the_powerful_radio_galaxy_PKS_0409-75/links/61945fd5d7d1af224bfae727/HI-absorption-at-z07-against-the-lobe-of-the-powerful-radio-galaxy-PKS-0409-75.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lH8ej-0YMmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
