It is a reimplementation of parts of the original SoFiA pipeline (ascl: 1412.001) in the C programming language and uses OpenMP for multithreading, making it substantially faster and more memory-efficient than its predecessor. At its core, SoFiA 2 uses the Smooth+ Clip algorithm for source finding which operates by spatially and spectrally smoothing the data on multiple scales and applying a user-defined flux threshold relative to the noise level in each iteration. A wide range of useful preconditioning and post-processing filters is available, including noise normalization, flagging of artifacts and reliability filtering. In addition to global data products and source catalogs in different formats, SoFiA 2 can also generate cutout images and spectra for each individual detection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Y0-TYkg6YM4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ascl.soft09005W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
