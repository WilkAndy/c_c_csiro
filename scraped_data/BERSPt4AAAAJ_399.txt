In particular, the formation and evolution of galaxies, including our own, is a wide field of research in astronomy. Three dimensional (spatial) scientific visualisation is typically limited to simulated galaxies, due to the inherently two dimensional spatial resolution of Earth-based observations. We present a novel approach to reconstruct and visualise 3D representations of galaxies based on observational data, using the scientific visualisation software Splotch to generate high quality visual representations that provide a new perspective of galaxies nearby the Milky Way."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17541403608721672307&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
