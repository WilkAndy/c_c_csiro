The selection of the brightest sources is based on their HI peak flux density (S peak\u2273 116 mJy) as measured from the spatially integrated HIPASS spectrum. The derived HI masses range from\u223c 10 7 to 4\u00d7 10 10 M\u2299. While the BGC (z< 0.03) is complete in S peak, only a subset of\u223c 500 sources can be considered complete in integrated HI flux density (F\u2273 25 Jy km s-1). The HIPASS BGC contains a total of 158 new redshifts. These belong to 91 new sources for which no optical or infrared counterparts have previously been cataloged, an additional 51 galaxies for which no redshifts were previously known, and 16 galaxies for which the cataloged optical velocities disagree. Of the 91 newly cataloged BGC sources, only four are definite HI \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 534, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16593570775462978057", "cites_id": ["16593570775462978057"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/421744/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CSLGKrQ0SOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 6, "2005": 17, "2006": 21, "2007": 26, "2008": 23, "2009": 22, "2010": 30, "2011": 21, "2012": 30, "2013": 31, "2014": 31, "2015": 38, "2016": 33, "2017": 37, "2018": 33, "2019": 35, "2020": 26, "2021": 26, "2022": 31, "2023": 15}}
