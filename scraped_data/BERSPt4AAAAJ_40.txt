Seven Wolf-Rayet stars were detected at 2.4 GHz, of which two were also detected at 1.4 GHz. We have identified six Wolf-Rayet stars, WR 14, 39, 48, 90, 105, and 112, that have nonthermal emission. The ATCA data confirm that at least 40% of Wolf-Rayet stars with measured spectral indices have nonthermal emission at centimeter wavelengths. Properties of each of the six sources are discussed. The measured spectral indices are between 0 and-1.0, and the radio luminosities are of order 10 29 ergs s-1. So far 10 confirmed sources of nonthermal emission are known, including the six ATCA detections and four previously known cases, WR 125, 140, 146, and 147. In all cases, the nonthermal radio emission almost certainly originates from an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12744524842378457141", "cites_id": ["12744524842378457141"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/307314/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NfAbHdKl3bAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 7, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 10, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
