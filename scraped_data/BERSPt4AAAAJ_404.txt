It performs 2D tilted-ring analysis based on a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, thus quantifying the kinematic geometry of galaxy discs, and deriving high-quality rotation curves that can be used for mass modeling of baryons and dark matter halos."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Ic1VZgkJnDsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ascl.soft05012O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
