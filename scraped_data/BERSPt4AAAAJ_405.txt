Typically found in merging pairs, galaxy groups and clusters, HI features in galaxy surroundings can span many hundreds of kpc, tracing gravitational interactions between galaxies and ram pressure forces moving through the intra-group/cluster medium. Upcoming large HI surveys, e.g., with the wide-field (FOV = 30 square degrees) Phased Array Feeds on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP), will provide a census of LSB structures in the Local Universe. By recording and comparing the properties (length, shape, HI mass, etc.) of these observed structures and their associated galaxies, we can - using numerical simulations - try to establish their origin and evolutionary path."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:X0DADzN9RKwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07312", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-3qZnkE8CN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
