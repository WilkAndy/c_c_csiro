It uses the widefield, high-resolution capability of the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a radio interferometer consisting of 36 \u00d7 12-m dishes equipped with Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radioquiet zone in Western Australia. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (\u221290\u25e6 < \u03b4 <+30\u25e6) to a redshift of z   0.26, and generate spectral line image cubes at \u223c30 arcsec resolution and \u223c1.6 mJy beam\u22121 per 4 kms\u22121 channel sensitivity. ASKAP\u2019s instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered by the PAF\u2019s 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, WALLABY is expected to detect around half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z \u223c 0.05 (\u223c200 Mpc)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ymY9cBF3mdcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.uwc.ac.za/handle/10566/5844", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BSrzeRDl-hMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
