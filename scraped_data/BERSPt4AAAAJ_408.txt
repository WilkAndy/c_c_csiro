The latter allow and encourage interested researchers from around the world to visualise, analyse and possibly download data from many different science and frequency domains. With the enormous growth of data volumes and complexity, open archives are essential to explore ideas and make discoveries. Open source software is equally important for many reasons, including reproducibility and collaboration. I will present examples of open archive and software tools, including the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA), the Local Volume HI Survey (LVHIS), the 3D Source Finding Application (SoFiA) and the Busy Function (BF). Astronomy is international and includes or links to an incredibly wide range of sciences, computing, engineering, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:xGWFX6Gbr9MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/open-astronomy-and-big-data-science/9BB4405935DC3F8E5C2FD55CCD8C6809", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Beuy0nerurUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
