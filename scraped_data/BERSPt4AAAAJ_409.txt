These catalogues were obtained from images taken at 960MHz (\u03bb= 32cm) and 1320MHz (\u03bb= 23cm). For the point source catalogue, we combine the ASKAP data with the previously published MOST catalogue (Turtle et al. 1998PASA... 15.. 280T; Wong et al. 2011SerAJ. 183.. 103W, Cat. J/other/Ser/183.103) and the ATCA= 20, 13, 6 and 3cm catalogues (Wong et al. 2011SerAJ. 183.. 103W, Cat. J/other/Ser/183.103, 2012SerAJ. 184... 93W, J/other/Ser/184.93, and references therein)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:nqdriD65xNoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019yCat..74901202J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
