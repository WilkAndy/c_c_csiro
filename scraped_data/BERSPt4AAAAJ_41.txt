In the present paper we report on the results of a pilot project that is based on data from this all-sky survey. The project was carried out on an area of 600 deg 2 centered on the nearby Centaurus A (Cen A) group of galaxies at a mean velocity of v\u2299\u223c 500 km s-1. This was recently the subject of a separate and thorough optical survey. We found 10 new group members to add to 21 galaxies already known in the Cen A group: five of these are previously uncataloged galaxies, while five were previously catalogued but not known to be associated with the group. Most of the new members have H I masses close to our survey limit of 10 7 M\u2299 at the assumed group distance of 3.5 Mpc. The new detection with the largest H I mass is ESO 174-G? 001 with M \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11522147683214814690", "cites_id": ["11522147683214814690"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/307854/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4u2bW0Xk5p8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 13, "2001": 10, "2002": 13, "2003": 8, "2004": 7, "2005": 5, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
