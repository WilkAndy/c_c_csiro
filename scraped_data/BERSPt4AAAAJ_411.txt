After a successful ASKAP Early Science period, it is now time to focus on full ASKAP to conduct major 21-cm sky surveys (specifically WALLABY & EMU), with all data products and source catalogs publicly available. Multi-wavelength collaborations remain the key to advancing our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, underpinned by state-of-the-art simulations. I will give examples of the physical processes driving galaxy transformations in groups and clusters, the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies and triggers for star formation with particular emphasis on atomic and molecular hydrogen gas content and kinematics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019lgei.confE..68K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
