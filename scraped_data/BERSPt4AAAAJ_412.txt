The LVHIS sample consists of nearly 100 galaxies, including new discoveries, spanning a large diversity in size, shape, mass and degree of peculiarity. The hydrogen properties of dwarf galaxies in two nearby groups, Sculptor and CenA / M83, are analysed and compared with many rather isolated dwarf galaxies. Around 10% of LVHIS galaxies are transitional or mixed-type dwarf galaxies (dIrr/dSph), the formation of which is explored. \u2014 I also provide a brief update on WALLABY Early Science, where we focus on studying the Hi properties of galaxies as a function of environment. WALLABY (Dec < +30 degr, z < 0.26) is conducted with the Australian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/neutral-hydrogen-in-nearby-dwarf-galaxies/B32C47E5F35852EBB65839C4DD6360FB", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RuRKXXw8L4QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
