I also describe our open-source software package SoFiA, a flexible and highly modular Source Finding Application developed by the WALLABY team, which will be used to find and characterise the 500 000+ galaxies expected to be individually detected in our survey. To model the gas kinematics of\u223c 5000 well-resolved WALLABY galaxies we created a pipeline that will facilitate this complex and time-consuming process. I will also briefly report on progress in 3D visualisation of stars and gas in galaxies with the open-source, ray-tracing software Splotch."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ASPC..512..249K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
