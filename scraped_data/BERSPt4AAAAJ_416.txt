Spectral analysis, hardness ratios, X-ray variability, and cross-correlations with catalogues in other wavelengths, allowed us to identify and classify the observed sources as X-ray binaries in the NGC 1512/1510 system, background objects and foreground stars. We detected 106 sources in the energy range 0. 2\u2212 12 keV, 15 within the D25 ellipses of NGC 1512 and NGC 1510. The properties of the most interesting sources are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/744654/LDucci1_p.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
