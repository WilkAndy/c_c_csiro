Here we present the results of the multiwavelength analysis of the galaxy pair NGC 1512/1510. The H i distribution of NGC 1512 is very extended with two pronounced spiral/tidal arms. Hundreds of independent UV-bright regions are associated with dense H i clouds in the galaxy outskirts. We confirm the detection of ionized gas in the majority of them and characterize their physical properties, chemical abundances and kinematics. Both the gas distribution andthe distribution of the star-forming regions are affected by gravitational interactionwith the neighbouring blue compact dwarf \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/ionized-and-neutral-gas-in-the-xuv-discs-of-nearby-spiral-galaxies/7DF094D3FDAA43C2BBD881785D2D200A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r1i9qWp4ZtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
