The survey will study the distribution of H i emission and absorption with unprecedented angular and velocity resolution, as well as molecular line thermal emission, absorption, and maser lines. The area to be covered includes the Galactic plane (|b| < 10\u00b0) at all declinations south of \u03b4 = +40\u00b0, spanning longitudes 167\u00b0 through 360\u00b0to 79\u00b0 at b = 0\u00b0, plus the entire area of the Magellanic Stream and Clouds, a total of 13 020 deg2. The brightness temperature sensitivity will be very good, typically \u03c3T\u2243 1 K at resolution 30 arcsec and 1 km s\u22121. The survey has a wide spectrum of scientific goals, from studies of galaxy evolution to star formation, with particular contributions to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6006190441873941993", "cites_id": ["6006190441873941993"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/gaskapthe-galactic-askap-survey/4A1684E726FAE189CB1B1B918C47E005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6SU-fWJGWlMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 13, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
