Very recently, the system was proposed as the counterpart of an unidentified gamma-ray source; two Fermi (GeV-energies) sources were detected in spatial superposition. Available 843 MHz and interferometric data at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz showed two shells. Yet the relation of the radio source with the high energy sources has not been firmly established. We search for evidence of non-thermal radio emission to shed light on the nature of the high energy sources. We implemented cm-observations using the new receivers of the Australia Telescope Compact Array, at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz, with extensive uv-coverage. Archival lower frequency radio data have been re-reduced, and analysed together with data at other energy ranges (optical, infrared, X-rays, gamma-rays).
