Molonglo 843 MHz and ATCA data at 1.4  and 2.4 GHz showed two shells. Recent high-resolution IR imaging revealed a  complex dust structure and ongoing star formation. New high-bandwidth and  high-resolution data of the RCW49 field were obtained to survey the radio  emission at arcsec scale and investigate the small-scale features and nature of  the HII region.- Data were collected with the new 2-GHz bandwidth receivers and  the CABB correlator of the ATCA, at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz. In addition, archival  observations at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz have been re-reduced and re-analyzed, together  with optical, IR, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations.- The CABB data result in  the most detailed radio continuum images of RCW49 to date. The radio emission  closely mimics the near-IR emission observed by Spitzer, showing pillars and  filaments. The brightest continuum emission comes from the region known as the  bridge. The overall flattish spectral index is consistent with a free-free  emission mechanism. However, hints of nonthermal components are also present in  the bridge. A jet-like structure surrounded by a bubble feature whose nature is  still unclear has been discovered close to the Westerlund~2 core. Two apparent  bow shocks and a number of discrete sources have been detected as well in the  surroundings of RCW49. We also report on and discuss the possible detection of  a H RRL.- The radio results support an association between the cm continuum and  molecular emission. The detection of the RRL kinematically favors a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/handle/11336/3158", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kFptIx3XvfMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
