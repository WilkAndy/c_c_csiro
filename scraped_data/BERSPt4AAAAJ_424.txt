The neutral hydrogen (HI) is the most sensitive component of a galaxy to distortions. Asymmetries in the gas distribution and tidal streams or tails are possible signs of gas removal mechanisms such as mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping, evaporation and starvation. The frequency and strength of the different stripping mechanisms depend on various physical properties of the galaxies and their environment. We propose to observe a sample of 6 spiral galaxies that appear to have 4-10 times less neutral hydrogen than normal, non interacting, field galaxies of the same size and morphology, suggesting recent or ongoing gas stripping. We will study the HI gas distribution and kinematics of the selected galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.5200D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
