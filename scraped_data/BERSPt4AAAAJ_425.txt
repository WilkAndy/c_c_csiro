The targeted galaxies lie along sightlines to known, bright continuum sources (selected from the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey), which will be used to probe for absorption. Our aim is to conduct the first detailed study of nearby galaxies in HI absorption, and to determine how detection rate varies with distance from the centre of the galaxy (ie impact parameter). This will reveal new information about the size and mass of spiral galaxies-essential measurements in tests of galaxy evolution models. The results will also provide essential information for the design of ASKAP-FLASH. With the pilot observations of this project complete, we request time to continue with the program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.5266R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
