Compared with previous peculiar-velocity surveys, the 2mtf survey provides more accurate width measurements and more uniform sky coverage, combining observations with the Green Bank, Arecibo, and Parkes telescopes. With this new redshift-independent distance database, we will significantly improve our understanding of the mass distribution in the local Universe."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/2masstullyfisher-survey-mapping-the-mass-in-the-universe/5D0A940761E4B575E3820C10E1F7907B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p5DjcGt858wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
