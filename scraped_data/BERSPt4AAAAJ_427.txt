As star formation occurs primarily within molecular clouds, understanding how and where these clouds are most likely to form is an important piece of the star formation puzzle. Since the atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in star forming galaxies is the reservoir from which the molecular gas forms, cold HI is believed to be a necessary phase in converting the ubiquitous warm HI gas into cold molecular gas. Tracing the locations of cold HI gas via narrow HI line emission (eg, Young et al. 1996, 1997) in low metallicity galaxies may currently be the best way to identify future sites of star formation. The uniformly high spectral (0.65-1.3 km/s) and spatial (300 pc) resolution of the VLA-ANGST survey is ideally suited for identifying cold HI through line-of-sight narrow line \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AAS...21920102W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
