RCW49 has been observed with MOST and ATCA at 20+ 13cm, where radio emission from the cluster stellar components remains hidden by thermal continuum from the HII-region. Very recently, the Fermi Collaboration detected a GeV source, projected onto the TeV source, and identified it as a gamma-ray pulsar. HESS follow-up observations did not yield a clear identification of the nature of HESS J1023-575. We propose to observe RCW49 with CABB at 6+ 3cm (arcsec angular resolution) to study the radio emission, derive spectral index information and analyze the radiation regime. The detection of non-thermal radiation will provide a powerful tool to study the origin of the TeV \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:wLxue7F8ec0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4307B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
