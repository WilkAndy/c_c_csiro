Our current focus is to characterize the kinematics of disk-dominated objects at intermediate inclinations throughout the WALLABY detection volume. In this context, we are testing the effectiveness of 3 popular approaches for extracting kinematic parameters: RotCUR and VElFit, which operate on velocity fields, and tiRiFiC, which operates on datacubes. We report on our recent progress, which includes tiRiFiC algorithm development, simulating galaxy disks and testing RotCUR, VElFit and tiRiFiC on a suite of nearby realizations, and shifting real observations to larger distances and examining their kinematics with RotCUR. We find that VElFit and tiRiFiC, the latter allowed to fit higher-order harmonics, can both recover the kinematic parameters of disk galaxies with noncircular motions. We also find discrepancies between the RotCUR parameters recovered for real galaxies, shifted in distance such that there are less than 10 beams along the semi-major axis, and their full-resolution counterparts. Future work will include additional tiRiFiC development, fitting more distant simulated galaxy datasets, as well as shifted real datasets with VElFit and tiRiFiC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YTuZlYwrTOUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://wallaby-survey.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WM-0007-01_Galaxy_Kinematics.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aVL8yau1sccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
