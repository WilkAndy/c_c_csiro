These H II regions appear as tiny emission-line objects in narrowband images obtained by the NOAO Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG). We present spectroscopic confirmation of four isolated H II regions in two systems; both systems have tidal H I features. The results are consistent with stars forming in interactive debris as a result of cloud-cloud collisions. The H \u03b1 luminosities of the isolated H II regions are equivalent to the ionizing flux of only a few O stars each. They are most likely ionized by stars formed in situ and represent atypical star formation in the low-density environment of the outer parts of galaxies. A small but finite intergalactic star formation rate will enrich and ionize the surrounding medium. In one system, NGC 1533, we calculate a star formation rate of 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14549209493143229617", "cites_id": ["14549209493143229617"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/381905/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sRSL8fIs6ckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 11, "2007": 12, "2008": 10, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
