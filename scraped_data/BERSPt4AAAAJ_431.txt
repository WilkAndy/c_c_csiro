Both galaxies are known to have spectacular X-ray tails. ESO 137-001 also has co-aligned H-alpha and warm H_2 tails. While we have collected much data of ESO 137-001 from major space observatories like Chandra, Spitzer and Hubble, the ATCA data will allow us to constrain the amount of the HI gas in the tails. Along with a Mopra proposal by our group to search for CO emission from ESO 137-001 (PI: S. Sivanandam), we will obtain the missing key information of the cold ISM that is required to better understand the thermal history of the stripped ISM, galaxy transformation, intracluster star formation and the puzzling X-ray double tails of ESO 137-001."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3080S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
