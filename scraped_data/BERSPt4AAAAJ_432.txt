They are interacting, gas-rich dwarf galaxies of sub-solar metallicity, not unlike the building blocks that assembled the large galaxies that dominate groups and clusters, and representative of the conditions at the height of cosmic star formation. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) can make huge strides in understanding galactic metabolism and the ecological processes that govern star formation, by observations of the Magellanic Clouds and other, nearby Magellanic-type irregular galaxies. Two programmes with SKA Pathfinders attempt to pave the way: the approved Galactic ASKAP Spectral Line Survey (GASKAP) includes a deep survey in HI and OH of the Magellanic Clouds, whilst MagiKAT is proposed to perform more detailed studies of selected regions within the Magellanic Clouds-also including Faraday rotation measurements and observations at higher frequencies. These surveys also close the gap with the revolutionizing surveys at far-IR wavelengths with the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/articles/7p88cs20p", "cites_per_year": {}}
