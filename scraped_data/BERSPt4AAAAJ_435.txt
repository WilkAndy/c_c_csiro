Wide-field imaging of the groups was obtained with the 20-cm multibeam system on the 64-m Parkes telescope. We have detected 10 previously uncatalogued H i sources, one of which has no visible optical counterpart. We examine the H i properties of the groups, compared to their X-ray characteristics, finding that those groups with a higher X-ray temperature and luminosity contain less H i per galaxy. The H i content of a group depends on its morphological make-up, with those groups dominated by early-type galaxies containing the least total H i. We determined the expected H i for the spiral galaxies in the groups, and found that a number of the galaxies were H i deficient. The H i deficient spirals were found both in groups with and without a hot intragroup medium.
