Utilizing observations from the {\\it Spitzer Space Telescope}, we have found it to be a luminous infrared starburst galaxy with a star formation rate of , arising from exceptionally strong molecular PAH emission ($L_{7.7\\micron} = 1.50 \\times 10^{9} L_{\\odot}$) and far-infrared emission from cold dust. The galaxy exhibits a weak mid-infrared continuum compared to other starforming galaxies and U/LIRGs. This relative lack of emission from small grains suggests atypical interstellar medium conditions compared to other starbursts. We do not detect significant Ne {\\sc v} or O {\\sc iv}, which implies an absent or very weak AGN. The galaxy possesses a prominent bulge of evolved stars and a stellar mass of 4.4(1.4). With its plentiful gas supply and current star formation rate, a doubling of stellar mass would occur on a timescale of 2 Gyr. Compared to local galaxies, HIZOA J0836-43 appears to be a \"scaled-up\" spiral undergoing inside-out formation, possibly resembling stellar disk building processes at intermediate redshifts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.4040", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YMBd3Ja0xeAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
