Some important results concerning the galaxy groups HCG31 [1] and Mkn1087 [2] have already been published. Here we present our new ATCA H i map of the starburst galaxy Tol9 within the Klemola 13 group."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_75.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3DVyECrgwMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
