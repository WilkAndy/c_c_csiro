The ionized gas of its nucleus was studied using VLT UVES data, leading to the detection of the weak O and C recombination lines and the confirmation of a localized N (possibly also He) enrichment resulting from chemical pollution by Wolf-Rayet stars. The neutral gas was analyzed using new ATCA data from the LVHIS project and shows intriguing kinematics that could suggest that NGC 5253 has interacted with a gas-rich dwarf companion or the nearby, giant spiral M 83."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_10.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rC0D1UkJGoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
