These observations are part of an effort to construct an all-sky peculiar velocity survey to match the already complete 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS). Such a survey will be a significant improvement over previous all-sky peculiar velocity surveys both in numbers and sky coverage. This survey will map directly the distribution of mass in the local universe, and in combination with 2MRS will investigate the biasing between galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution. Roughly 40% of edge-on spirals in 2MRS already have available rotation widths, but the sky coverage is very uneven, and in particular is very poor in the southern hemisphere. Parkes observations are therefore vital in order to take full advantage of all-sky selection from the 2MASS XSC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:LK8CI43ZvvMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1304M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
