Because of this complexity, understanding star formation in galaxies remains one of the biggest challenges in current observational and theoretical astrophysics. Stars are thought to form in response to high gas densities, driven by turbulence, by interactions, or triggered stochastically (eg,[4, 3]). The evolution of the stars in turn is believed to affect the surrounding gas, as supernovae and stellar winds deposit kinetic and thermal energy, as well as ionizing photons into the interstellar medium (ISM). Untangling the interplay between these different processes is difficult, because in most cases, the events that trigger star formation are not obvious, nor are the events that feed back into the dynamics and structure of the ISM.Our approach to this problem are multi-wavelength observations that capture both the detailed history of star formation and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-6933-8_85.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZHicN4Klp-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
