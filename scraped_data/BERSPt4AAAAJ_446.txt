The local universe is the only place where peculiar velocity measurements are sufficiently accurate to compare this with the distribution of mass. In the linear regime peculiar velocities are directly proportional to the underlying gravity. Previous peculiar velocity surveys have struggled to meet their potential because of large errors on individual measurements, poor statistics and uneven sky coverage. A survey based on 2MRS will provide significantly more uniform sky coverage than has previously been available, providing a qualitatively better sample for velocity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AAS...210.8403M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
