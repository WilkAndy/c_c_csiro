Our primary aim is to determine the Star Formation Law, using multiple tracers of star formation. The requested HI observations of 13 galaxies will be analysed with a comparable number of galaxies from the ATCA archive to determine the relationship between the SFL and HI column density. All 13 galaxies to be observed with the TTCA have Halpha and UV data already."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..538W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
