The survey has a median rms noise of 6.0 mJybeam^{-1} and is complete to a mean flux density of 22 mJy. This northern extension is divided in two regions, l= 36^ o-52^ o and l= 196^ o-212^ o,| b|\u2264 5^ o. We have detected 77 HI galaxies, 20 of which have been previously detected in HI, 35 with possible counterparts in optical, NIR and/or FIR. The detection of these 77 galaxies allows a closer inspection of the large-scale structures behind the Milky Way. The objects we found complement the limits of several known voids like Microscopium, Cygnus and Delphinus. We found some objects which fall on the Orion Void region (l= 206^ o, b=-2^ o, V= 1500kms^{-1}), concluding this is not a real void. We can trace a new filament structure which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006RMxAC..26..192I/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
