Also recently, Nelan et al.(2004) using FGS-HST data, have demonstrated that this star has an O-star companion 55 mas distant (140 AU at 2.5 kpc), with a similar spectral type to HD 93129A. This relatively close companion opens the strong possibility of a WCR origin for the non-thermal radio emission. We propose to use the LBA to attempt to resolve the source of the non-thermal emission in HD 93129A. If the non-thermal emission region displays a curved morphology similar to that observed in WR140, this would support a WCR interpretation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:yY3RG6sOEgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..325B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
