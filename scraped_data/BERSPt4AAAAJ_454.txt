The groupcontains the prominent merging galaxy NGC 3256, which is surroundedby a number of HI fragments (English et al. 2003), the tidally disturbedgalaxy NGC 3263 (Koribaiski et al., in prep.), and several other galaxies.Using ATCA HI data we examine the nature of this massive gas cloud andits relationship to the neighbouring galaxies. This could be a primordial\u201cgalaxy building block\u201d. However the cloud\u2019s properties, in conjunctionwith the spatial extents and velocity behaviours of the group\u2019s majorgalaxies, may indicate that it originated out of tidal debris.The most spectacular feature in the NGC 3256 Group is a galaxy-sized HIcloud (see \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004IAUS..217...41E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rgYZ6QAukdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
