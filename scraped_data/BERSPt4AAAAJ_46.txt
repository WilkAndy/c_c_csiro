This R-band luminosity density is approximately 70% of that found by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This leads to a local star formation rate density of log (SFR [Script M\u2609 yr-1 Mpc-3])=-1.80 (random)\u00b10.03 (systematic)+ log (h 70) after applying a mean internal extinction correction of 0.82 mag. The gas cycling time of this sample is found to be t gas= 7.5 Gyr, and the volume-averaged equivalent width of the SINGG galaxies is EW (H\u03b1)= 28.8 \u00c5 (21.2 \u00c5 without internal dust correction). As with similar surveys, these results imply that SFR (z) decreases drastically from z~ 1.5 to the present.
