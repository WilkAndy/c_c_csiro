Star formation is traced all along the arms, which extend over more than 100 kpc. This is a challenge for models of interacting galaxies that predict an infall of gas and a burst of star formation in the center. We present new observations of the large-scale distribution and kinematics of the atomic gas obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and VLT observations of the stellar populations, together with a comparison with numerical simulations of the evolution of gas and stars in this interacting system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002sf2a.conf..417H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
