All three ProPlyD-like objects are clearly resolved with an extent of a few arcseconds. The integrated 6cm fluxes are up to 1.3 times higher than the 3cm fluxes with spectral indices averaged over the whole clump between  and -0.5 (), indicating the likely presence of non-thermal emission in at least some of the sources. All measured fluxes are at least one order of magnitude higher than those predicted by Brandner et al. 2000. Due to the unexpectedly large radio luminosities of the ProPlyD-like features and because the radio emission is extended a (proto-)stellar origin of the non-thermal emission from a dust enshrouded star appears unlikely. Instead we propose that magnetized regions within the envelope of the ProPlyD-like nebulae exist.
