All three ProPlyDs (protoplanetary disks) are clearly resolved, showing a head-tail extent of approx. 4 inches. Proplyd 3 shows the most pronounced head-tail structure with a 3 cm flux density ratio between head and tail of about 10:1. The tail is very well defined and at least 2 inches long, pointing away from the central star cluster. Unfortunately, ProPlyD 3 is rather faint in the low-sensitivity HST broad band image shown by Brandner et al.; it is located outside the region of their high sensitivity HST H(alpha) image."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20020078408", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gl5fSFrCbdkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
