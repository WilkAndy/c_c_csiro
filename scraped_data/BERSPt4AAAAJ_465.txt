Since SINGG is based on an HI selected sample we target a sample with a known reservoir of interstellar gas but which is free from the normal UV/optical/IR bias in star forming galaxy surveys. SINGG will be used to address astrophysical issues ranging from stellar physics to cosmology. Here we outline the scientific case, sample selection, experimental design, analysis procedures, and products of the survey and detail its the initial public data release. The release includes flux calibrated narrow band and R images as well as pure emission line maps. Example images from the survey are shown. These illustrate the wide range of HII region distributions found in HI selected galaxies.
