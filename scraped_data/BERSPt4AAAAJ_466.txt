As such, it is an interesting and useful object of study for stellar and galactic astronomers alike. We have obtained a 50 ksec observation of this region using the CHANDRA X-ray observatory. The high stellar density in the core and the distance to the cluster (7 kpc), however, render the stars in the core unresolved even to CHANDRA. In order to properly determine the X-ray luminosities of the stars in the core, and to examine the evidence for diffuse X-ray emission near the core, we have attempted to\" reconvolve\" the X-ray image by simulating the expected distribution of X-ray photons. As a template, we have used an optical image of the stars in the cluster obtained by the HST Planetary Camera. We find that we can produce the observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AAS...198.9503B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
