This survey will obtain H-alpha images for 500 galaxies selected purely on the basis of their 21-cm line emission from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS). This is the first study of star formation in a statistically well-defined sample of galaxies whose selection is not biased by stellar luminosity. The observations will help to constrain how much star formation in the nearby universe is taking place in the high-surface brightness large-line-width galaxies naturally selected by emission line surveys and how much is taking place in more quiescent environments. The data will also allow quantitative characterization of large-scale star formation for different Hubble types, and provide tests for models of global star formation. Preliminary results from the first three observing runs will be presented and discussed in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AAS...198.5417F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
