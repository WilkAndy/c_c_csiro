A comparison of optical and near-infrared photometry with theoretical pre-main-sequence and main-sequence isochrones yields physical properties like the effective temperature or the mass of individual objects. The large area coverage of the ground-based data enables us to study radial gradients in the physical properties and to assign probabilities for cluster membership to individual sources. Optical and near-infrared emission-line images and spectra draw a dynamical picture of the interstellar medium surrounding the cluster, and point to regions which might exhibit diffuse X-ray emission from shock-heated gas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000HEAD....5.4207B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
