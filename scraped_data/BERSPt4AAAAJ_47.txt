These are complemented by GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Explorer) ultraviolet (UV)-, SINGG H\u03b1- and Spitzer mid-infrared images, allowing us to compare the distribution and kinematics of the neutral atomic gas with the locations and ages of the stellar clusters within the system.For the barred, double-ring galaxy NGC 1512 we find a very large H i disc, \u223cfour times its optical diameter, with two pronounced spiral/tidal arms. Both its gas distribution and the distribution of the star-forming regions are affected by gravitational interaction with the neighbouring blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 1510. While the inner disc of NGC 1512 shows quite regular rotation, deviations are visible along the outer arms and at the position of NGC 1510.
