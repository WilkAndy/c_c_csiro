The surveyed region covers \\b\\ less than or equal to 5 degrees in the zone of avoidance (ZOA) from Galactic longitude 308 degrees to 332 degrees. The survey represents the first phase of a blind H I survey covering the southern ZOA (l = 212 degrees to 36 degrees). We have detected H I in 42 galaxies above a 3 sigma limit of 60 mJy. The galaxies detected in this survey have velocities out to 6000 km s(-1) and H I masses in the range 4 x 10(7) to 3 x 10(10)M. (h(75)(-2)). Only eight of the 42 galaxies have velocities previously measured. A further nine galaxies appear to have optical counterparts in the Woudt's 1998 catalog. In total, 16 of the galaxies appear to be associated with IRAS sources, although only three of these are without optical counterparts.
