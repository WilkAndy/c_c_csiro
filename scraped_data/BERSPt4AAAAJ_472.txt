In this region, identifications are biased towards nearby luminous galaxies and sample uniformity is hampered by patchines in the Galactic extinction. To determine a clearer picture of the local distribution of galaxies in the so-called Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), we present some early results from the blind neutral hydrogen (HI) survey of the southern ZOA, carried out using the 21cm multibeam receiver on the Parkes telescope. We have detected about 250 galaxies in a 10 (deg) wide strip centred on the Galactic equator, extending from Galactic longitude 300 (deg) to 332 (deg), in the velocity range of-1200 to 12700 km s (-1). The sensitivity limit at the 3sigma level is 25 mJy, with 70% of the detections having no previous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AAS...194.0408J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
