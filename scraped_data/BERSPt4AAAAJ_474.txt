The observations were taken between 1994 and 1997. Radio continuum emission has been detected from 16 sources at 3 cm. Of these 11 sources were detected at 6 cm, seven sources were detected at 13 cm and 2 sources were detected at 20 cm (Chapman et al. 1999)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/nonthermal-radio-emission-from-wolfrayet-stars/3FAAA2D98A0EA969085A7A257C1453D2", "cites_per_year": {}}
