There are many possible galaxy interaction mechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression, gravitational interaction and cluster tides. The relative importance of these mechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly known parameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halos that surround galaxies. A nearby example of a galaxy interaction where the mechanism is controversial is that between our own Galaxy and two of its neighbours -- the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Here we present the first results of a new HI survey which provides a spectacular view of this interaction. In addition to the previously known Magellanic Stream, which trails 100 degrees behind the Clouds, the new data reveal a counter-stream which lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the Clouds. This result supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streams are tidally torn from the body of the Magellanic Clouds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y-nylJOFiLYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
