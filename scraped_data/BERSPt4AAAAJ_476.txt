The survey, expected to be completed by early 1999, will map the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) between longitudes 212 {(deg}) and 36 {(deg}), between latitudes-5 {(deg}) and+ 5 {(deg}), covering the redshift range-1200 to 12700 km/s. The eventual 5-\u03c3 sensitivity limit is estimated to be 10 mJy/beam, which should produce a catalog of several thousand previously unknown galaxies. A shallow survey for high peak HI flux density objects has uncovered about 100 galaxies, including many in the heavily-obscured Great Attractor region. The first hidden galaxies discovered through the survey to be mapped with the Australia Telescope Compact Array indicate that low HI column density systems may be common in the final catalog."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...192.5208H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
