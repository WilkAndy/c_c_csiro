The workshop, sponsored by the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF), was a meeting of mm-wave specialists as well as astronomers and students interested in the field, and attracted about 80 participants from 13 institutions. The program consisted of 23 oral contributions (5\u201345 min) followed by lively discussions. Abstracts of most of the contributions are presented here, arranged by groups dealing with subjects such as \u2018A Basic Introduction\u2019, \u2018Astronomy in the mm-range with Mopra\u2019 and \u2018Projects: Galactic and Extragalactic 3 mm-wave astronomy\u2019."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/millimetrewave-astronomy-abstracts-from-a-oneday-workshop-held-on-19-april-1995-at-the-australia-telescope-national-facility/62B50E820464F47F3F70317A8DFF995E", "cites_per_year": {}}
