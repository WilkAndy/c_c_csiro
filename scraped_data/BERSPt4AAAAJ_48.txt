We achieved a 5\u03c3 H i column density sensitivity of 1019 cm\u22122 over a spectral channel width of 8 km s\u22121 for emission filling the 180 \u00d7 88 arcsec2 synthesized beam. The corresponding H i mass sensitivity is 1.2 \u00d7 105 M\u2299, assuming a distance of 1.9 Mpc. For the first time, the vast H i disc of NGC 300 has been mapped over its entire extent at a moderately high spatial resolution of about 1 kpc.NGC 300 is characterized by a dense inner H i disc, well aligned with the optical disc of 290\u00b0 orientation angle, and an extended outer H i disc with a major axis of more than 1\u00b0 on the sky (equivalent to a diameter of about 35 kpc) and a different orientation angle of 332\u00b0.
