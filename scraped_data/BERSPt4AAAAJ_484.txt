If dark halos exist \naround galaxies they certainly affect the shape of the galactic disks and especially their outer \nregions. The study of galactic disks in return can then provide information on the halo shape \nand mass. In the following we will first make some general remarks about `warps', study their \nshapes in optical and H i emission, and finally discuss their kinematics and origin. Orbits in \ngalaxies whose inclination angle changes with radial distance from the centre are considered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASA...12..135K", "cites_per_year": {}}
