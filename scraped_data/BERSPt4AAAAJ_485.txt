The workshop, sponsored by the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF), was a meeting of dark matter (DM) specialists as well as astronomers interested in the field, and attracted about 80 participants from nine institutions. The program consisted of 22 oral contributions (15\u201345 minutes), followed by lively discussions, as well as podium discussions at the end of each day. Abstracts of most of the contributions are presented here, arranged by subject groups which range from \u2018Gravitational Lensing and DM in Clusters\u2019, \u2018DM in Elliptical Galaxies\u2019, \u2018The Nature of DM\u2019, and \u2018The Shapes of Dark Halos\u2019 to \u2018Alternatives to DM\u2019."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/dark-matter-abstracts-from-a-twoday-workshop-held-in-february-1994-by-the-australia-telescope-national-facility/A4968E35192CAAEBE5DB6A26FE8259E2", "cites_per_year": {}}
