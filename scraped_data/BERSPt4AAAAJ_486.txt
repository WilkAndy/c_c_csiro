NGC 1808 is a mild starburst galaxy with a far-infrared luminosity of\u224d 2\u00d7 10 10 L sun at a distance of 10.9 Mpc. Well known are the radial dust filaments which emerge form the central part of its disk in the northeastern direction. In the same region a velocity anomaly has been found, indicating outflow of neutral hydrogen gas into the halo. NGC 1808 should be classified as a barred spiral galaxy as can be inferred from the H\u03b1-observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993sfgi.conf...45K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
