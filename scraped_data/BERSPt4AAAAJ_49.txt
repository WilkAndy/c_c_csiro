We have begun a dedicated WISE High Resolution Galaxy Atlas project to fully characterize large, nearby galaxies and produce a legacy image atlas and source catalog. Here we summarize the deconvolution techniques used to significantly improve the spatial resolution of WISE imaging, specifically designed to study the internal anatomy of nearby galaxies. As a case study, we present results for the galaxy NGC 1566, comparing the WISE enhanced-resolution image processing to that of Spitzer, Galaxy Evolution Explorer, and ground-based imaging. This is the first paper in a two-part series; results for a larger sample of nearby galaxies are presented in the second paper."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12754218528582784326", "cites_id": ["12754218528582784326"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/144/2/68/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RtXhTy0WALEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 12, "2019": 11, "2020": 11, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
