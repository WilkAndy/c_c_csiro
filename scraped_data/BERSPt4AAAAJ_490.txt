Stars are formed from gas, with the atomic hydrogen (Hi) in galaxies being the raw fuel for the formation of giant molecular gas clouds. These clouds are the birthplaces of stars. In order to continue this process in the future, galaxies need to replenish their gas reservoir. Simulations and theory suggest two main avenues through which galaxies can do that: they can accrete gas directly form the intergalactic medium (cosmological or smooth accretion) or gas-rich satellites can fall into the galaxy (gas-rich minor mergers, clumpy accretion). Observations of galaxies in the local Universe have been searched for ongoing gas accretion such as gas-rich minor mergers, gas accreted from the intergalactic medium, high velocity clouds or gas that is being reaccreted after it was expelled by star formation (eg the Galactic Fountain model). While all these phenomena have been detected, the total amount of gas that has been found to accrete onto galaxies, is still about one order of magnitude less than required to balance the amount of gas that is converted into stars (Heald, 2015; S\u00e1nchez Almeida et al., 2014a; Sancisi et al., 2008). This thesis investigates gas-rich galaxies and the origin of their large gas content. If they are gas-rich, because they recently accreted gas, they should be perfect laboratories to study the mechanisms of gas accretion. If they are gas-rich because they are inefficient at forming stars from their given Hi reservoir, then the study of these galaxies helps to understand which mechanisms regulate the galactic gas cycle. A sample of Hi eXtreme (hix) galaxies has been selected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:WWeOtg8bX_EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/items/6fbdaf1c-b38c-4f91-b82e-2225f4c2e12c/1/katharina_lutz_thesis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7qoWvP3gsK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
