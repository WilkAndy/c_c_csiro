The high stellar density in the core of the cluster and the distance to the cluster (6.1 kpc) dictate that the stars in the core are unresolved even to CHANDRA. In order to properly determine the X-ray luminosities of the stars in the core, and to examine the evidence for diffuse X-ray emission near the core, we have attempted to\" reconvolve\" the X-ray image by simulating the expected distribution of X-ray photons using as a template an optical image of the stars in the cluster obtained by the HST Planetary Camera. We find that we can reproduce the observed CHANDRA image of the core of the cluster using this technique, and derive constrained source luminosities for all the member stars in the core. In addition, we show that the observed contribution of diffuse X-ray emission is generally small in the core, though there are some limited regions devoid of strong stellar emission where diffuse X-ray emission may be important. We finally discuss the applicability of this technique to other CHANDRA observations of crowded fields."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:oTdOBqtIf_kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11459057151019339362&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yk5oI8S_Bp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
