In addition to their nuclear activity, which makes them so popular, the selected galaxies have several other phenomena in common, such as bars, gas out ow, and possibly nuclear rings. The relationship between those phenomena is discussed in the following. I will show that the gas dynamics in the outer and inner parts of these galaxies are strongly related to their starburst activity. Galaxy interactions as well as bars play an important role as they a ect the gas ow within the disk, driving gas inwards and outwards where it accumulates at preferred resonance orbits. The in owing gas provides the supply for the central starburst region from which gas is eventually ejected into the halo. I compare the group of nearby starburst galaxies with distant ultra-luminous galaxies (Arp 220, NGC 6240, etc.), in which strong tidal interactions cause the radial gas in ow. In both groups highresolution Hi absorption measurements reveal fast-rotating nuclear rings."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:RuPIJ_LgqDgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Baerbel.Koribalski/min_lecture/min_lecture_final.ps.gz", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fCgwDsgq2ucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
