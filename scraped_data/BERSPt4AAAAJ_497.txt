ESO215 {G? 009 was selected from the HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog because it has the second highest H i mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies with measured B band apparent magnitudes. We nd that it is an isolated dwarf irregular galaxy with an old stellar population. We place an upper limit on the current star formation rate of 2: 5 10 3"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2636666096216491606&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VsZMSNhRlyQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
