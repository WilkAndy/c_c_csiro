Dashed lines show the borders of the Parkes ZOA search area in the southern hemisphere, and extension to the north, to Dec+ 20. The lower panel adds the galaxies uncovered by the HI Parkes ZOA Survey (Henning et al. in prep.). The HI-detected objects fill in the optical ZOA remarkably well. The Great Attractor region is seen as an overdensity at l 300 340, the Hydra-Antlia filament at l 280 and the Puppis filament crosses the Galactic plane at l 240. The Local and Sagittarius voids are visible as an underdensity at l 350 52.The obscuration due to dust and the high stellar density in our Galaxy blocks our optical view of the extragalactic Universe over 20% of the sky, somewhat less in the infrared, the \u201cZone of Avoidance\u201d(ZOA).
