The absorption line consists of three components separated in both location as well as velocity. We derive HI column densities of 2 10 22 cm 2 assuming a gas spin temperature of 100 K. For the rst time we are able to reliably estimate the HI cloud sizes (15 pc) and atomic gas densities (200 cm 3). Our results suggest that the HI gas is not associated with the"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17666607280194914110&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PgdZOrhlLPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
