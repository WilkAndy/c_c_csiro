The purpose of this proposal is: a) to work towards meeting our scientic goals see Section I, b) to develop procedures for mapping this and similar galaxies (Section II) in order to benet the E-ALFA consortium as a whole, and c) to provide the rst deep benchmark case for the Alfa Galaxy Environmental Survey (AGES), as described in a separate observing proposal by J. Davies et al. Note that, at the present time, our team is focussing only on NGC 2903, in collaboration and cooperation with the AGES group.Our test case galaxy is NGC 2903 (see Fig. 1), the subject of a pre-ALFA project, entitled\\The HI Environment of NGC 2903 {A Pilot Study for ALFA\", which was awarded 120 hours (A1802). Thirty-eight hours of this observing run occurred in January, 2004, and the remainder have yet to be scheduled.
