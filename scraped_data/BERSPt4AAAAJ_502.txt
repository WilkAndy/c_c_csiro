The selected BCDGs are found in different environments, from apparently isolated to compact groups. Our aims are to analyze the chemical and physical properties of their gas, their star formation activity, the kinematics, the stellar populations and environment. Here we present new exciting H i results obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array for some BCDGs, all showing interaction features. This analysis strongly suggests that interactions of BCDGs with lowluminosity dwarf galaxies are the main trigger mechanism of the observed star-forming bursts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=4a73754df5b946ea84ebaf5685539a061e317b14", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VtzyYNb_kFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
