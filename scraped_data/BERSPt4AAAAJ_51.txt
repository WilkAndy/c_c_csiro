The survey is specifically designed to investigate various galactic environments to higher sensitivity, higher velocity resolution and higher spatial resolution than previous fully sampled, 21-cm multibeam surveys. The emphasis is on making detailed observations of nearby objects although the large system bandwidth (100 MHz) will allow us to quantify the H i properties over a large instantaneous velocity range.In this paper, we describe the survey and its goals and present the results from the precursor observations of a 5 \u00d7 1-deg2 region containing the nearby (\u223c10 Mpc) NGC 628 group. We have detected all the group galaxies in the region including the low-mass (MH I\u223c107 M\u2299) dwarf, dw0137+1541.
