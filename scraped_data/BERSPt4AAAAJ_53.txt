Our sample consists of all galaxies with Local Group velocities vLG\u2009<\u2009550\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 or distances D < 10\u2009Mpc that are detected in the H\u2009i Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). Using full synthesis observations in at least three configurations of the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), we obtain detailed H\u2009i maps for a complete sample of gas-rich galaxies with . Here we present a comprehensive LVHIS galaxy atlas, including the overall gas distribution, mean velocity field, velocity dispersion, and position-velocity diagrams, together with a homogeneous set of measured and derived galaxy properties. Our primary goal is to investigate the H\u2009i morphologies, kinematics, and environment at high resolution and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=355387464461689317", "cites_id": ["355387464461689317"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/478/2/1611/4898085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5aHdGASX7gQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 23, "2022": 18, "2023": 14}}
