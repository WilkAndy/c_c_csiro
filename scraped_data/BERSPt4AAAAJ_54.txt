We use these new scaling relations to investigate the environmental dependence of the H\u2009i content of galaxies. We find that galaxies in high-density environments tend to have on average less H\u2009i than galaxies with the same stellar mass in low-density environments. Our new H\u2009i scaling relations allow us to identify individual galaxies, as well as group/cluster environments, that have an \u2018anomalous\u2019 H\u2009i content. We map the global distribution of H\u2009i-deficient and H\u2009i-excess galaxies on the sky and compare it to the large-scale structure of galaxies. We find galaxy clusters to be H\u2009i deficient, and we identify that the regions surrounding clusters tend to be H\u2009i excess. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of using H \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1877494082502811522", "cites_id": ["1877494082502811522"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/444/1/667/1009465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gl96r-syDhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 11, "2022": 20, "2023": 5}}
