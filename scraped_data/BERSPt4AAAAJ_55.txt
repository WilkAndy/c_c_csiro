Our low-resolution H\u2003i maps show, for the first time, the disturbed H\u2003i morphology that NGC 5253 possesses, including tails, plumes and detached H\u2003i clouds. The high-resolution map reveals an H\u2003i plume at the SE and an H\u2003i structure at the NW that surrounds an H\u03b1 shell. This latter structure is related to an expanding bubble in the interstellar medium (ISM), but it will almost certainly not originate a galactic wind. We confirm that the kinematics of the neutral gas in NGC 5253 are highly perturbed and do not follow a rotation pattern. We discuss the outflow and infall scenarios to explain such disturbed kinematics, analyse the environment in which NGC 5253 resides and compare its \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6024603300807116846", "cites_id": ["6024603300807116846"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/419/2/1051/988660", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LghBSciwm1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 11, "2014": 12, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
