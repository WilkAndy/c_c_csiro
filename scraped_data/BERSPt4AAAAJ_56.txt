Our automated ELdot finder searches SINGG narrowband and continuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the optical radius of the target galaxy (> 2\u00d7 r 25 in the R band). Follow-up long-slit spectroscopy and deep Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) images (exposure time> 1000 s) distinguish outlying H ii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines ([O iii], H\u03b2, or [O ii]) have been redshifted into the SINGG bandpass. We find that these deep GALEX images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopic follow-up because outlying H ii regions separate cleanly from background galaxies in color\u2013color space.
