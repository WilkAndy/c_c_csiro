They are expected to be devoid of non-baryonic dark matter, since they can only form from dissipative material ejected from the discs of the progenitor galaxies. We investigate the gas dynamics in a sample of six bona fide TDGs around three interacting and post-interacting systems: NGC 4694, NGC 5291, and NGC 7252 (\u201cAtoms for Peace\u201d). For NGC 4694 and NGC 5291, we analyse existing H\u2009I \u2009data from the Very Large Array (VLA), while for NGC 7252 we present new H\u2009I \u2009 observations from the Jansky VLA, together with long-slit and integral-field optical spectroscopy. For all six TDGs, the H\u2009I \u2009emission can be described by rotating disc models. These H\u2009I \u2009discs, however, have undergone less than a full rotation since the time of the interaction/merger event, raising the question of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18328364157296763100", "cites_id": ["18328364157296763100"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2015/12/aa26613-15/aa26613-15.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3OCs3RduW_4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 11, "2017": 11, "2018": 17, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
