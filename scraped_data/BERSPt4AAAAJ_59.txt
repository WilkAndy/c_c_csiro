Previous studies have shown that the power spectra can be approximated as two power laws, a shallow one on large scales (larger than 500 pc) and a steeper one on small scales, with the break between the two corresponding to the line-of-sight thickness of the galaxy disk. The break separates the 3D behavior of the interstellar medium on small scales, controlled by star formation and feedback, from the 2D behavior on large scales, driven by density waves in the disk. The break between these two regimes depends on the thickness of the plane, which is determined by the natural self-gravitating scale of the interstellar medium. We present a thorough analysis of the power spectra of the dust and gas emission at several wavelengths in the nearby \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7393669801340936189", "cites_id": ["7393669801340936189"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2012/03/aa18282-11/aa18282-11.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_Z91z4KXm2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
