This survey aims to identify protoplanetary discs with signs of grain growth. We detected 90 per cent of the sources at 3 and 7 mm, and determined the spectral slopes, dust opacity indices and dust disc masses. We also present temporal monitoring results of a small subset of sources at 7, 15 mm and 3+6\u2009cm to investigate grain growth to centimetre (cm) sizes and constrain emission mechanisms in these sources. Additionally, we investigated the potential correlation between grain growth signatures in the infrared (10 \u03bcm silicate feature) and millimetre (1\u20133 mm spectral slope, \u03b1).Eleven sources at 3 and 7 mm have dominant thermal dust emission up to 7 mm, with seven of these having a 1\u20133 mm dust opacity index less than unity, suggesting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15708938879628685646", "cites_id": ["15708938879628685646"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/425/4/3137/1749155", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TjGXdq5cAdoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 14, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 4}}
