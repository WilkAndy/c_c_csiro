To accomplish this we introduce a model for fitting the velocity power spectrum including the effects of non-linear redshift space distortions (RSD), allowing us to recover unbiased fits down to scales k = 0.2\u2009h\u2009Mpc\u22121 without the need to smooth or grid the data. Our fitting methods are validated using a set of simulated 2MTF surveys. Using these simulations we also identify that the Gaussian distributed estimator for peculiar velocities of Watkins & Feldman is suitable for measuring the velocity power spectrum, but sub-optimal for the 2MTF data compared to using magnitude fluctuations \u03b4m, and that, whilst our fits are robust to a change in fiducial cosmology, future peculiar velocity surveys with more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2491095633752301176", "cites_id": ["2491095633752301176"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/471/3/3135/3873951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eB5Vz0cmkiIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 18, "2020": 7, "2021": 18, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
