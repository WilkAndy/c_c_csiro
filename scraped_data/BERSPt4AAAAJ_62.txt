During pilot observations taken in the spring of 2016 we observed NGC 4330, an intermediate mass (M* \u2243 109.8 M\u2299) edge-on star forming spiral currently falling into the core of the Virgo cluster. While previous H\u03b1 observations showed a clumpy complex of ionised gas knots outside the galaxy disc, new deep observations revealed a low surface brightness ~10 kpc tail exhibiting a peculiar filamentary structure. The filaments are remarkably parallel to one another and clearly indicate the direction of motion of the galaxy in the Virgo potential. Motivated by the detection of these features which indicate ongoing gas stripping, we collected literature photometry in 15 bands from the far-UV to the far-IR and deep optical long-slit \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2264389480055718839", "cites_id": ["2264389480055718839"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/06/aa32373-17/aa32373-17.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t0PaHzy6bB8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 6, "2019": 14, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 20, "2023": 8}}
