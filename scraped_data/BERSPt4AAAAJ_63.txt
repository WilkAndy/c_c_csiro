We detected 13 H i sources in the field, including two galaxies not previously known to be members of the group, bringing the total number of confirmed galaxies in this group to 26. Each of the H i galaxies can be associated with an optically catalogued galaxy. No \u2018intergalactic H i clouds\u2019 were found to an H i mass limit of \u223c3.5 \u00d7 108 M\u229a. We have estimated the expected H i content of the late-type galaxies in this group and find that the total detected H i is consistent with our expectations. However, while no global H i deficiency is inferred for this group, two galaxies exhibit individual H i deficiencies. Further observations are needed to determine the gas removal mechanisms in these galaxies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3506281105698537256", "cites_id": ["3506281105698537256"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/356/1/77/1055221", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KD_TqxbQqDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
