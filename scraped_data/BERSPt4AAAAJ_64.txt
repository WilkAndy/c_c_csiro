Observed parameters include systemic velocities, profile linewidths and integrated fluxes. The linewidth information can be combined with the optical and infrared photometry to obtain distances. The 1822 H i observations complement an inventory of archives. All told, H i linewidth information is available for almost all of five samples:(i) luminosity\u2013linewidth correlation calibrators;(ii) zero-point calibrators for the Type Ia supernova scale;(iii) a dense local sample of spiral galaxies with within 3000 km s\u2212 1;(iv) a sparser sample of 60-\u03bcm selected galaxies within 6000 km s\u2212 1 that provides an all-sky coverage of our extended supercluster complex; and (v) an even sparser sample of flat galaxies, extreme edge-on spirals, extending in a volume out to 12 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13078911881975116071", "cites_id": ["13078911881975116071"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/414/3/2005/1035598", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JzHDxQ-hgbUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 15, "2015": 4, "2016": 15, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
