They show the presence of a far more extended HI distribution than previously observed with the VLA, and a very regular velocity field out to a distance of about 50 kpc. The combined analysis of the HI data with optical and near-infrared (NIR) images argue against previous warp models used to describe the dynamics of this object. Further analysis of the new B-band image obtained at the European Southern Observatories New Technology Telescope (NTT) indicates clearly that the polar structure extends continuously to within about 200 pc of the nucleus of the central host galaxy, ruling out the presence of a 'hole' in the central region of this component. The presence of two spiral arms stretching out in the polar disk seems to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16999607002332714847", "cites_id": ["16999607002332714847"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/as/as97092", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X9dIN4C86usJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 6, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 7, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
