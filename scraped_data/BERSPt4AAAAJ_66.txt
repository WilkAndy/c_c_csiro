This object, designated HIPASS J0731-69, contains\u223c 10 9 M\u2299 of H I, or nearly one-third as much atomic gas as NGC 2442 itself. No optical counterpart to any part of HIPASS J0731-69 has yet been identified, consistent with the gas being diffuse and its streamlike kinematics. If the gas in HIPASS J0731-69 was once part of NGC 2442, then it was most likely a fairly recent tidal encounter with a moderately massive companion that tore it loose, although the possibility of ram-pressure stripping cannot be ruled out. This discovery highlights the potential of the HIPASS data for yielding new clues to the nature of some of the best-known galaxies in the local universe."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3835747302885322089", "cites_id": ["3835747302885322089"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/321453/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aW2kbNlPOzUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
