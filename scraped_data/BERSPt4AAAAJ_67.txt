The H I mass of the cloud (HIPASS J1712-64) is very low, 1.7\u00d7 10 7 M\u2299, using an estimated distance of\u223c 3.2 Mpc. Most significantly, we have found no optical companion to this object to very faint limits [\u03bc (B)\u223c 27 mag arcsec-2]. HIPASS J1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than, H I 1225+ 01 (the Virgo H I cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. The mean velocity dispersion measured with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is only 4 km s-1 for the main component and, because of the weak or nonexistent star formation, possibly reflects the thermal line width (T< 2000 K) rather than bulk motion or turbulence. The peak column density for HIPASS J1712-64, from the combined Parkes and ATCA data, is only 3.5\u00d7 10 19 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17107242876403852547", "cites_id": ["17107242876403852547"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/301542/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AyViDsIiae0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
