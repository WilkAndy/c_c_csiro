Here, we propose a new analytic function, named the \u2018busy function\u2019, that can be used to accurately describe the characteristic double-horn H\u2009i profile of many galaxies. The busy function is a continuous, differentiable function that consists of only two basic functions, the error function, erf(x), and a polynomial, |x|n, of degree n \u2265 2. We present the basic properties of the busy function and illustrate its great flexibility in fitting a wide range of H\u2009i profiles from the Gaussian profiles of dwarf galaxies to the broad, asymmetric double-horn profiles of spiral galaxies. Applications of the busy function include the accurate and efficient parametrization of observed H\u2009i spectra of galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1292075571184209095", "cites_id": ["1292075571184209095"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/438/2/1176/1007156", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xwxl4-Jf7hEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
