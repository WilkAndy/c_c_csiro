The tail is \u223c 300 kpc long in projection and contains \u223c 5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 of H\u2009i. We detect no diffuse stellar light at the location of the tail down to \u223c 28.5 mag arcsec\u2212 2 in g band. We speculate that the tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of NGC 3187 (a member of HCG 44) by the group tidal field. In this case, a simple model indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's H\u2009i was stripped during a time interval of < 1 Gyr. Alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of an interaction between HCG 44 and NGC 3162, a spiral galaxy now \u223c 650 kpc away from the group. Regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected H\u2009i tail shows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in HCG 44. It also highlights that deep H\u2009i observations over a large field are needed to gather a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14337392592860492379", "cites_id": ["14337392592860492379"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/428/1/370/1051712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WzLEtpmm-MYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
