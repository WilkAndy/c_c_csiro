ESO 215-G? 009 was selected from the HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog because it has the second highest HI mass-to-light ratio of the galaxies with measured B-band apparent magnitudes. We find that it is an isolated dwarf irregular galaxy with an old stellar population. We place an upper limit on the current star formation rate of\u223c 2.5\u00d7 10-3 Script M\u2299 yr-1. The extended HI disk shows regular rotation (v rot= 51\u00b18 km s-1) and, at a column density of\u223c 5.0\u00d7 10 19 atoms cm-2, can be traced out to over 6 times the Holmberg radius of the stellar component (radius at \u03bc B= 26.6 mag arcsec-2). After foreground star subtraction, we measure a B-band apparent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4629454312119347349", "cites_id": ["4629454312119347349"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/422923/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lSjGQSsgP0AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
