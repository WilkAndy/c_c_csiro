This work uses the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey and the Discrete Persistent Structures Extractor to define the filamentary structure of the local cosmic web. H\u2009i spectral stacking of H\u2009i Parkes all sky survey observations yields the H\u2009i fraction for filament galaxies and a field control sample. The H\u2009i fraction is measured for different stellar masses and fifth nearest neighbour projected densities (\u03a35) to disentangle what influences cold gas in galaxies. For galaxies with stellar masses log(M\u22c6) \u2264 11 M\u2299 in projected densities 0 \u2264 \u03a35 < 3 galaxies Mpc\u22122, all H\u2009i fractions of galaxies near filaments are statistically indistinguishable from the control sample. Galaxies with stellar masses log(M\u22c6) \u2265 11 M\u2299 have a systematically higher H\u2009i fraction near filaments than the control sample \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11958999296992657095,17805961515959316077", "cites_id": ["11958999296992657095", "17805961515959316077"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/466/4/4692/2733859", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x75kxn_m9qUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
