Future large-scale H\u2009i surveys will resolve the discs of many thousands of galaxies, allowing a statistical analysis of their disc and halo kinematics, mass distribution and dark matter content. Here, we present an automated procedure which fits tilted-ring models to H\u2009i data cubes of individual, well-resolved galaxies. The method builds on the 3D Tilted Ring Fitting Code (TiRiFiC) and is called Fully Automated TiRiFiC (FAT). To assess the accuracy of the code, we apply it to a set of 52 artificial galaxies and 25 real galaxies from the Local Volume H\u2009i Survey (LVHIS). Using LVHIS data, we compare our 3D modelling to the 2D modelling methods DiskFit and ROTCUR. A conservative result is that FAT accurately models the kinematics and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=606388703721614086", "cites_id": ["606388703721614086"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/452/3/3139/1750297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BusiMVBTaggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
