In order to understand the origin of physical properties of apparently isolated H i clouds like VIRGOH i 21, we numerically investigate physical properties of tidal H i debris that were formed by galaxy\u2014galaxy interactions in clusters of galaxies. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal debris with total H i masses of 108\u2013109 M\u2299 can have (1) a wide spread of H i velocities (>200 km s\u22121), (2) a small mass fraction of stars (\u223c10 per cent), and (3) a mean B-band surface brightness of the stellar components fainter than 30 mag arcsec\u22122. These results suggest that VIRGOH i 21, which lies at a projected distance of \u223c150 kpc from the one-armed, H i-rich spiral galaxy M99 (NGC 4254), is tidal debris. We propose that the comparison between the simulated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1428998965140813382", "cites_id": ["1428998965140813382"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/363/1/L21/951409", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rnae1fzS1BMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 12, "2008": 9, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
