We have also measured the^ 12^ CO 2-1/1-0 and^ 12^ CO/^ 13^ CO J= 1-0 intensity ratios at two positions out in the disk. NGC 1808 has highly concentrated^ 12^ CO emission and an asymmetrical velocity field in^ 12^ CO that shows distinct peaks on both sides of centre. The line intensity ratios indicate that the central molecular gas of NGC 1808 is in a state of high excitation compared with giant molecular clouds in the disk of the Milky Way. We present a\" two-phase\" model that can explain the observations with a warm T_k_= 100 K, diffuse low-mass medium of moderate density, n (H_2_)= 2000 cm^-3^, surrounding colder T_k_= 15 K, dense cores, n (H_2_)= 10^ 5^ cm^-3^.
