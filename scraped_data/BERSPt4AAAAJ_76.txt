The survey covers of an area covered by the Dark Energy Survey, reaching a depth of 25\u201330 rms at a spatial resolution of 11\u201318 arcsec, resulting in a catalogue of 220 000 sources, of which 180 000 are single-component sources. Here we present the catalogue of single-component sources, together with (where available) optical and infrared cross-identifications, classifications, and redshifts. This survey explores a new region of parameter space compared to previous surveys. Specifically, the EMU Pilot Survey has a high density of sources, and also a high sensitivity to low surface brightness emission. These properties result in the detection of types of sources that were rarely seen in or absent from previous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:EaFouW7jFu4C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17465989233766292181", "cites_id": ["17465989233766292181"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/evolutionary-map-of-the-universe-pilot-survey/6FD673731F193C01A133A89602B75F86", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1dpvWauoY_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 32, "2023": 23}}
