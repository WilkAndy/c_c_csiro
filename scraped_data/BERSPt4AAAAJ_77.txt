All galaxies show clear evidence of radio haloes, including the first detection in the Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 55. In 11 galaxies, we find a thin and a thick disc that can be better fitted by exponential rather than Gaussian functions. We fit our spinnaker (SPectral INdex Numerical Analysis of K(c)osmic-ray Electron Radio-emission) 1D cosmic ray transport models to the vertical model profiles of the non-thermal intensity and to the non-thermal radio spectral index in the halo. We simultaneously fit for the advection speed (or diffusion coefficient) and magnetic field scale height. In the thick disc, the magnetic field scale heights \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9436725668731908386", "cites_id": ["9436725668731908386"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/476/1/158/4810553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:InGTb__79YIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 27, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
