Although turbulence is widely believed to be driven by star formation, recent studies have shown that this driving mechanism may not be dominant in regions of low star formation surface density (\u03a3 SFR), such those as found in dwarf galaxies or the outer regions of spirals. We have generated average H i line profiles in a number of nearby dwarfs and low-mass spirals by co-adding H i spectra in subregions with either a common radius or \u03a3 SFR. We find that the individual spatially resolved\" superprofiles\" are composed of a central narrow peak (\u223c 5\u201315 km s\u2212 1) with higher velocity wings to either side, similar to their global counterparts as calculated for the galaxy as a whole. Under the assumption that the central peak reflects the H i turbulent velocity dispersion, we compare measures of H i kinematics \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17454200609667505681", "cites_id": ["17454200609667505681"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/88/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EV6jafrGOfIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 11}}
