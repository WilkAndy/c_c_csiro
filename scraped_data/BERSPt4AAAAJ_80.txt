Taking advantage of the unique wavelength coverage (100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 \u03bcm) of the Herschel Space Observatory and complementing our dataset with Spitzer-IRAC 5.8 and 8 \u03bcm and Spitzer-MIPS 24 and 70 \u03bcm data, we construct temperature and luminosity density maps by fitting two modified blackbodies of a fixed emissivity index of 1.5. We find that the \u201ccool\u201d dust grains are heated to temperatures of between 11 K and 28 K, with the lowest temperatures being found in the outskirts of the galaxy and the highest ones both at the center and in the bright HII regions. The infrared/submillimeter total luminosity (5\u20131000 \u03bcm) is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2529073596389223548", "cites_id": ["2529073596389223548"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2012/07/aa19291-12/aa19291-12.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fGyZSwkTGSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 10, "2014": 12, "2015": 5, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
