A performance difference of a few percent corresponds to a significant number of galaxies being detected or undetected. As such, the performance of the automated source finding is of paramount importance to both of these surveys. We have analysed the performance of various source finders to determine which will allow us to meet our survey goals during the DINGO and WALLABY design studies. Here we present a comparison of the performance of five different methods of automated source finding. These source finders are duchamp, gamma-finder, a cnhi finder, a 2d\u20131d wavelet reconstruction finder and a sigma clipping method (s + c finder). Each source finder was applied to the same three-dimensional data cubes containing (a) point sources with a Gaussian velocity profile and (b) spatially extended \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=282350384691757053", "cites_id": ["282350384691757053"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/comparison-of-potential-askap-hi-survey-source-finders/15CB46E5E5FD27941B83C82363DB8E13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_T-_zS0c6wMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 12, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
