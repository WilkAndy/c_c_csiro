The rotation curve rises linearly out to a radius of 7 kpc and then appears to flatten out at\u223c 100 km s-1. The H I mass out to 24.5 kpc is\u223c 6\u00d7 10 9 M\u2299, or 10% of the total mass out to this radius. The color, central surface brightness, scale height, and scale length of the disk of IC 5249 are R-I\u2248 0.4, \u03bc= 20.6\u00b10.1R C mag arcsec-2, 600\u00b140 pc, and 11\u00b12 kpc, respectively. Additional light to that predicted by an exponential disk is present at distances greater than 3 kpc from the disk. At 5 kpc the surface brightness is 27\u201328R C mag arcsec-2. The measured distribution of surface brightness is used to constrain the abundance of low-mass main-sequence stars in the halo of the galaxy. A halo made up entirely of main-sequence stars heavier than 0.13 M\u2299 is excluded. We also find that less than 20% of the halo can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15895156735240073891", "cites_id": ["15895156735240073891"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300907/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o3IkpdXwltwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
