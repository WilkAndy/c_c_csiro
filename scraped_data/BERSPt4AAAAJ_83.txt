One of the most outstanding features of Circinus is its enormous size (at least 80 arcmin or nearly 100 kpc, assuming a distance of 4 Mpc) revealing a beautiful large-scale spiral pattern. The fit of a tilted-ring model to the velocity field reveals a strong kinematic warp of the outer spiral arms. The inner region (radius 250 arcsec or 5 kpc) contains a highly elongated structure with non-circular motions, suggesting that Circinus is a barred spiral galaxy. At the centre of Circinus there is a 50-arcsec or 1-kpc-radius Hi ring or disc rotating with a speed of at least 200 km s\u22121."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12507587410160385399", "cites_id": ["12507587410160385399"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/302/4/649/1012596", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d_3BQ3vgk60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
