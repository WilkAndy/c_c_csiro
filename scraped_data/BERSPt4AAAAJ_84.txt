The survey covers the Galactic longitude range  and Galactic latitudes  to an rms sensitivity of 6 mJy per beam per 27 km s\u2212 1 channel and yields 883 galaxies to a recessional velocity of 12,000 km s\u2212 1. The survey covers the sky within the H i Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) area to greater sensitivity, finding lower H i mass galaxies at all distances, and probing more completely the large-scale structures at and beyond the distance of the Great Attractor. Fifty-one percent of the H i detections have an optical/near-infrared (NIR) counterpart in the literature. A further 27% have new counterparts found in existing, or newly obtained, optical/NIR images. The counterpart rate drops in regions of high foreground stellar crowding and extinction, and for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3313399589687790804", "cites_id": ["3313399589687790804"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/3/52/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1AxEJl-P-y0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 13, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
