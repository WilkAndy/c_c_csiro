This project is part of the 2MASS Tully-Fisher survey (2MTF), aiming to map the galaxy peculiar velocity field within 100 \u2009h\u22121\u2009Mpc, with an all-sky coverage apart from Galactic latitudes |b| < 5\u00b0. A \u03c72 minimization method was adopted to analyse the Tully\u2013Fisher peculiar velocity field in J, H, and K bands, using a Gaussian filter. We combine information from the three wavebands, to provide bulk flow measurements of 310.9 \u00b1 33.9 , 280.8 \u00b1 25.0, and 292.3 \u00b1 27.8 km s\u22121 at depths of 20, 30, and 40 \u2009h\u22121\u2009Mpc, respectively. Each of these bulk flow vectors points in a direction similar to those found by previous measurements.
