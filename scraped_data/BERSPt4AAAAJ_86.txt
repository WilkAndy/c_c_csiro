In an effort to better understand the possible connections between line widths and SF, we have characterized H i kinematics in a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies by co-adding line-of-sight spectra after removing the rotational velocity to produce average global H i line profiles. These\" superprofiles\" are composed of a central narrow peak (\u223c 6\u201310 km s\u2212 1) with higher-velocity wings to either side that contain\u223c 10%\u201315% of the total flux. The superprofiles are all very similar, indicating a universal global H i profile for dwarf galaxies. We compare characteristics of the superprofiles to various galaxy properties, such as mass and measures of SF, with the assumption that the superprofile represents a turbulent peak with energetic wings to either side. We use these quantities to derive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7790432250437668844", "cites_id": ["7790432250437668844"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/765/2/136/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7I8VNtssHWwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
