In the two regions studied here, l= 36\u201352 and l= 196\u2013212,| b|\u2264 5, we have detected 77 HI galaxies, 20 of which have been previously detected in H I. The survey has a median rms noise of 6.0 mJy beam-1 and is complete to a mean flux density of 22 mJy. We have searched for multiwavelength counterparts to the 77 galaxies detected here: 19, 27, and 11 have a likely optical, 2MASS, and IRAS cataloged counterpart, respectively. A further 16 galaxies have likely visible counterparts on the Digitized Sky Survey. The detection of these 77 galaxies allows a closer inspection of the large-scale structures in these regions. We see several filaments crossing the Galactic plane, one of which appears to be the continuation of a sine-wave\u2013like feature that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9166669257818126650", "cites_id": ["9166669257818126650"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/426320/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ojm-dR-NNn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
