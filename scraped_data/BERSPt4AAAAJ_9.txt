The mission was primarily designed to extract point sources, leaving resolved and extended sources, for the most part, unexplored. Accordingly, we have begun a dedicated WISE Enhanced Resolution Galaxy Atlas (WERGA) project to fully characterize large, nearby galaxies and produce a legacy image atlas and source catalog. Here we demonstrate the first results of the WERGA project for a sample of 17 galaxies, chosen to be of large angular size, diverse morphology, and covering a range in color, stellar mass, and star formation. It includes many well-studied galaxies, such as M 51, M 81, M 87, M 83, M 101, and IC 342. Photometry and surface brightness decomposition is carried out after special super-resolution processing, achieving spatial resolutions similar to that of Spitzer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 326, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2157813665567412666", "cites_id": ["2157813665567412666"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/145/1/6/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uhGhoxgY8h0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 12, "2014": 33, "2015": 33, "2016": 34, "2017": 42, "2018": 28, "2019": 31, "2020": 23, "2021": 34, "2022": 35, "2023": 21}}
