The low DM confines the burst location within a sufficiently small volume to rigorously constrain the identity of the host galaxy. We identify 16 candidate galaxies in the search volume and single out ESO 601\u2013G036, an Sc galaxy at redshift z= 0.00867, as the most likely host galaxy. Ultraviolet and optical imaging and spectroscopy reveal that this galaxy has a star formation rate of approximately 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u2212 1 and oxygen abundance 12+ log (O/H)= 8.3\u00b10.2, properties that are remarkably consistent with the galaxy hosting the repeating FRB 121102. However, in contrast to FRB 121102, follow-up radio observations of ESO 601\u2013G036 show no compact radio emission above a 5\u03c3 limit of L 2.1 GHz= 3.6\u00d7 10 19 W Hz\u2212 1.
