We use adaptive kernel smoothing to map the velocity field, and compare it to reconstructions based on the redshift space galaxy distributions of the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) and the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey (PSCz). With a standard \u03c72 minimization fit to the models, we find that the PSCz model provides a better fit to the 2MTF velocity field data than does the 2MRS model, and provides a value of \u03b2 in greater agreement with literature values. However, when we subtract away the monopole deviation in the velocity zero-point between data and model, the 2MRS model also produces a value of \u03b2 in agreement with literature values. We also calculate the \u2018residual bulk flow\u2019: the component of the bulk flow not accounted for by the models \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15791894002840406199", "cites_id": ["15791894002840406199"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/456/2/1886/1061088", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t4jsMe0TKNsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 10, "2017": 12, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
