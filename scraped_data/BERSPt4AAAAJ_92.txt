The field size was 150 kpc\u00d7 260 kpc and the final velocity range spanned from 100 to 1133 km s\u2212 1. The ALFA beams have been mapped as a function of azimuth and cleaned from each azimuth-specific cube prior to forming final cubes. The final H i data are sensitive down to an H i mass of 2\u00d7 10 5 M\u2609 and column density of 2\u00d7 10 17 cm\u2212 2 at the 3 \u03c3 2 \u03b4 V level, where \u03c3 is the rms noise level and \u03b4 V is the velocity resolution. NGC 2903 is found to have an H i envelope that is larger than previously known, extending to at least three times the optical diameter of the galaxy. Our search for companions yields one new discovery with an H i mass of 2.6\u00d7 10 6 M\u2609. The companion is 64 kpc from NGC 2903 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17794521473217709091", "cites_id": ["17794521473217709091"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/692/2/1447/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I8QzHwDX8vYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
