This survey is expected to eventually catalog several thousand galaxies within Galactic latitude| b|< 5, mostly unrecognized before because of Galactic extinction and confusion. We present here the results of the first three detections to have been imaged with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. All the galaxies lie near Galactic longitude 325 and were selected because of their large angular sizes, up to 1 &fdg; 3. Linear sizes range from 53 to 108 kpc. The first galaxy is a massive 5.7\u00d7 10 11 M &sun; disk galaxy with a faint optical counterpart, SGC 1511.1-5249. The second is probably an interacting group of galaxies straddling the Galactic equator. No optical identification is possible. The third object appears to be an interacting pair of low column density galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8832365466018884882", "cites_id": ["8832365466018884882"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300633/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Eq17cJjdknoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 6, "2000": 10, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 8, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
