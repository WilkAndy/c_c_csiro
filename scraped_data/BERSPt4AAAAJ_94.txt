Star formation histories (SFHs) derived from resolved stars give us the unique opportunity to study past star-forming events that may have helped shape the currently visible H i distribution. Our sample of five nearby dwarf irregular galaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total H i mass and absolute B-band magnitude and is at the low-mass end of previously studied systems. We use Very Large Array H i line data to estimate the energy required to create the centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. We compare this energy estimate to the past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed from SFHs derived from data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. The inferred integrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10750918880838597233", "cites_id": ["10750918880838597233"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/738/1/10/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cbps5cLvMpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 12, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
