Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that the group tidal field is very efficient at stripping the outer H i gas of the disc if the gaseous disc of the LSB galaxy extends 2\u20135 times further than the stellar disc. We find that a massive, extended \u2018leading stream\u2019 orbiting the centre of the group can form out of the stripped outer H i envelope, while the severely shrunken LSB galaxy, whose stellar disc remains unaffected, continues on its path. The result is a relatively isolated, massive H i cloud with a ring- or arc-like shape, a very inhomogeneous density distribution (NH i\u223c 1.0 \u00d7 1017\u20131.1 \u00d7 1020 atom cm\u22122), and, initially, no stellar content.
