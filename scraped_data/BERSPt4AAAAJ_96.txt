The SCC area is\u223c 2400 deg 2 and covers \u03b4<-62. The average rms noise for the survey is 13 mJy beam-1. Five hundred thirty-six galaxies have been cataloged according to their neutral hydrogen content, including 114 galaxies that have no previous cataloged optical counterpart. This is the largest sample of galaxies from a blind H I survey to date. Most galaxies in optically unobscured regions of sky have a visible optical counterpart; however, there is a small population of low-velocity H I clouds without visible optical counterparts whose origins and significance are unclear. The rms accuracy of the HIPASS positions is found to be 1 &farcm; 9. The H I mass range of galaxies detected is from\u223c 10 6 to\u223c 10 11 M\u2299. There are a large number of late-type spiral galaxies in the SCC sample (66 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5157413927066651718", "cites_id": ["5157413927066651718"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/341582/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rsx1OqTQkkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 7, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
