We have mapped the intensity and velocity distribution of the ionized hydrogen in the galaxy using the Balmer series H\u03b1 spectral line.The semiresolved core (observed with a seeing disc of 30 pc) appears amorphous in shape, which is commonly observed in Seyfert 2 galaxies. Its peak coincides with the core position measured in the radio continuum, suggesting that ionized gas surrounds a non-thermal source.A circumnuclear ring or spiral of radius 220 pc and a rotational velocity of 350 km s\u22121 (assuming circular motions) surrounds the core. The inclination angle of this feature, i=40\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0, is less than that of the previously observed radio continuum disc. The velocity channel maps obtained for the H\u03b1 ring show that the kinematics resemble those of a rotating \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1964041451191139543", "cites_id": ["1964041451191139543"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/297/1/49/1019152", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1_xjPkutQRsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
