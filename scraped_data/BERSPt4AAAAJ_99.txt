The HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalog (BGC) is a subset of HIPASS and contains the 1000 H I\u2013brightest (peak flux density) galaxies. Here we present the 138 HIPASS BGC galaxies that had no redshift measured prior to the Parkes multibeam H I surveys. Of the 138 galaxies, 87 are newly cataloged. Newly cataloged is defined as having no optical (or infrared) counterpart in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Using the Digitized Sky Survey, we identify optical counterparts for almost half of the newly cataloged galaxies, which are typically of irregular or Magellanic morphological type. Several H I sources appear to be associated with compact groups or pairs of galaxies rather than an individual galaxy. The majority (57) of the newly cataloged galaxies lie within 10 of the Galactic plane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BERSPt4AAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12394412131373010792", "cites_id": ["12394412131373010792"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/342546/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aM9HQirMAawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
