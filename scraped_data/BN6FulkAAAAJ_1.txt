The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb\u22121 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb\u22121 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H\u2192ZZ(\u204e)\u21924\u2113, H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 and H\u2192WW(\u204e)\u2192e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H\u2192ZZ(\u204e), WW(\u204e), bb\u00af and \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H\u2192ZZ(\u204e)\u21924\u2113 and H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0\u00b10.4(stat)\u00b10.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7\u00d710\u22129, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:H0nRGT7Dr7IC", "num_citations": 20844, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1650605866782918575,17332986838234951968,6906129955920046972,5947814863875902686,10243107553919929785,1971151425299117470,12948160929791966263,3941204684366787615", "cites_id": ["1650605866782918575", "17332986838234951968", "6906129955920046972", "5947814863875902686", "10243107553919929785", "1971151425299117470", "12948160929791966263", "3941204684366787615"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200857X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r4fFYUoh6BYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 546, "2013": 2490, "2014": 2550, "2015": 2512, "2016": 2229, "2017": 1990, "2018": 2089, "2019": 1656, "2020": 1456, "2021": 1412, "2022": 1331, "2023": 460}}
