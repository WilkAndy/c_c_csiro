Such studies require data samples containing \u223c107 B-meson decays. The Belle detector is configured around a 1.5 T  superconducting solenoid and iron structure surrounding the KEK-B beams at the Tsukuba interaction region. B-meson decay vertices are measured by a silicon vertex detector situated just outside of a cylindrical beryllium beam pipe. Charged particle tracking is performed by a wire drift chamber (CDC). Particle identification is provided by dE/dx measurements in CDC, aerogel threshold Cherenkov counter and time-of-flight counter placed radially outside of CDC. Electromagnetic showers are detected in an array of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside the solenoid coil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 2254, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4566010884399740278", "cites_id": ["4566010884399740278"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900201020137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:drU2JbW6XT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 8, "2002": 42, "2003": 81, "2004": 99, "2005": 132, "2006": 116, "2007": 131, "2008": 150, "2009": 128, "2010": 108, "2011": 103, "2012": 100, "2013": 116, "2014": 92, "2015": 113, "2016": 120, "2017": 116, "2018": 118, "2019": 89, "2020": 60, "2021": 93, "2022": 87, "2023": 41}}
