In order to include particles with transverse momentum as low as 30 MeV, the data were recorded with the central solenoid magnet off. Charged particles were reconstructed with two algorithms (2-point \u201ctracklets\u201d and full tracks) using information from the pixel detector only. The lead\u2013lead collision centrality was characterized by the total transverse energy in the forward calorimeter in the range 3.2<|\u03b7|<4.9. Measurements are presented of the per-event charged particle pseudorapidity distribution, dNch/d\u03b7, and the average charged particle multiplicity in the pseudorapidity interval |\u03b7|<0.5 in several intervals of collision centrality. The results are compared to previous mid-rapidity measurements at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 396, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7516096672699141692,16789420956507083187,5962542005995285129", "cites_id": ["7516096672699141692", "16789420956507083187", "5962542005995285129"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312001864", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PE66ERqKTmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 23, "2013": 49, "2014": 41, "2015": 47, "2016": 69, "2017": 31, "2018": 44, "2019": 42, "2020": 21, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
