Production via top decay is not included in the signal definition. The measurement is based on 35 pb\u22121 of data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The W+b-jet cross section is defined for jets reconstructed with the anti-kt clustering algorithm with transverse momentum above 25 GeV and rapidity within \u00b12.1. The b-jets are identified by reconstructing secondary vertices. The fiducial cross section is measured both for the electron and muon decay channel of the W boson and is found to be 10.2\u00b11.9(stat)\u00b12.6(syst) pb for one lepton flavour. The results are compared with next-to-leading order QCD calculations, which predict a cross section smaller than, though consistent with, the measured value."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 389, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12840888519732186973,14896735824303451818,7547562061096617673,15078908400746226075,17996053677972690253", "cites_id": ["12840888519732186973", "14896735824303451818", "7547562061096617673", "15078908400746226075", "17996053677972690253"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311015036", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XU8HIxMANLIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 8, "2012": 101, "2013": 97, "2014": 42, "2015": 28, "2016": 28, "2017": 33, "2018": 15, "2019": 9, "2020": 17, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
