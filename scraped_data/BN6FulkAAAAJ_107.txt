The ATLAS data exhibit sensitivity to the light quark sea composition and magnitude at Bjorken x ~ 0.01. Specifically, the data support the hypothesis of a symmetric composition of the light quark sea at low x. The ratio of the strange-to-down sea quark distributions is determined to be 1.00(+0.25-0.28) at absolute four-momentum transfer squared Q^2 = 1.9 GeV^2 and x = 0.023."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 379, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8023368707657737192,9430258615008385508", "cites_id": ["8023368707657737192", "9430258615008385508"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4051", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6KPseVS7WG8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 20, "2013": 39, "2014": 63, "2015": 53, "2016": 36, "2017": 56, "2018": 31, "2019": 33, "2020": 17, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
