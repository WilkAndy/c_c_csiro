The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2010 and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u2212 1. No excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. Limits are set on the parameters of the minimal supergravity framework, extending previous limits. Within this framework, for A 0= 0 GeV, tan\ufeff \u03b2= 3, and \u03bc> 0 and for equal squark and gluino masses, gluino masses below 700 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 379, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17501035553025512177,1924839279731463094,14790703130309355570,15676904311167453159,8371236661120983729,7100803238474236386,2880856172742808035,14290235552016295334", "cites_id": ["17501035553025512177", "1924839279731463094", "14790703130309355570", "15676904311167453159", "8371236661120983729", "7100803238474236386", "2880856172742808035", "14290235552016295334"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.131802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8VKRaxwr4PIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 100, "2012": 141, "2013": 54, "2014": 31, "2015": 16, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
