The search is performed using 1.34 fb\u2212 1 of= 7 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector during 2011. Data-driven techniques are used to determine the backgrounds in kinematic regions that require at least six, seven or eight jets, well beyond the multiplicities required in previous analyses. No evidence is found for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in the context of a supersymmetry model (MSUGRA/CMSSM) where they extend previous constraints."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 369, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5471315472591327013,5123764909613399674,9593565268959039525,2986101779777763722,13640645533669328516,9302077052940011349,7152752371610703920,13939118618378411995", "cites_id": ["5471315472591327013", "5123764909613399674", "9593565268959039525", "2986101779777763722", "13640645533669328516", "9302077052940011349", "7152752371610703920", "13939118618378411995"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2011)099", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JY_nHW8E7ksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 11, "2012": 168, "2013": 41, "2014": 25, "2015": 15, "2016": 29, "2017": 21, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 17, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
