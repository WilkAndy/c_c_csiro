Using 275\u00d7 10 6 B B pairs we observe a B\u2192 K\u00b1\u03c0\u2213 signal with 2140\u00b153 events. The measured C P violating asymmetry is A C P (K+ \u03c0\u2212)=\u2212 0.101\u00b10.025 (s t a t)\u00b10.005 (s y s t), corresponding to a significance of 3.9 \u03c3 including systematics. We also search for C P violation in the decays B+\u2192 K+ \u03c0 0 and B+\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0 0. The measured C P violating asymmetries are A C P (K+ \u03c0 0)= 0.04\u00b10.05 (s t a t)\u00b10.02 (s y s t) and A C P (\u03c0+ \u03c0 0)=\u2212 0.02\u00b10.10 (s t a t)\u00b10.01 (s y s t), corresponding to the intervals\u2212 0.05< A C P (K+ \u03c0 0)< 0.13 and\u2212 0.18< A C P (\u03c0+ \u03c0 0)< 0.14 at 90% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 359, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13192651108747085707", "cites_id": ["13192651108747085707"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.191802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i4eIJkm2FbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 57, "2006": 48, "2007": 33, "2008": 23, "2009": 16, "2010": 11, "2011": 11, "2012": 14, "2013": 11, "2014": 14, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 17, "2018": 16, "2019": 12, "2020": 25, "2021": 11, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
