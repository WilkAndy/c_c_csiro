The experiment looked for the appearance of \u03bde in a predominantly \u03bd\u03bc wide-band neutrino beam at the CERN SPS. No evidence for oscillations was found. The 90% confidence limits obtained are \u0394m2<0.4 eV2 for maximal mixing and sin2(2\u03b8)<1.4\u00d710\u22123 for large \u0394m2. This result excludes the LSND allowed region of oscillation parameters with \u0394m2\u227310 eV2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 359, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2755132628683259118", "cites_id": ["2755132628683259118"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269303010505", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7vzASYcyPCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 7, "2004": 10, "2005": 11, "2006": 17, "2007": 14, "2008": 14, "2009": 14, "2010": 16, "2011": 18, "2012": 12, "2013": 29, "2014": 15, "2015": 20, "2016": 28, "2017": 25, "2018": 23, "2019": 13, "2020": 27, "2021": 19, "2022": 16, "2023": 7}}
