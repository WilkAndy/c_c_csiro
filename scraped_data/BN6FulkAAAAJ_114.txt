The analyses use a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb\u2212 1 collected by the ATLAS detector during the 2011 LHC data-taking period. Events are selected using leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons [W (e \u03bd, \u03bc \u03bd) and Z (e+ e\u2212, \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212, \u03bd \u03bd)] with the requirement of an associated isolated photon. The data are used to test the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and search for evidence for new phenomena. The measurements are used to probe the anomalous W W \u03b3, Z Z \u03b3, and Z \u03b3 \u03b3 triple-gauge-boson couplings and to search for the production of vector resonances decaying to Z \u03b3 and W \u03b3. No deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed and limits are placed on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings and on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:IF0FbId8XVwC", "num_citations": 354, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7760615334864722119,12599676218137424940,16725054758762819925", "cites_id": ["7760615334864722119", "12599676218137424940", "16725054758762819925"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.87.112003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x5gPkYc-s2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 35, "2014": 54, "2015": 42, "2016": 48, "2017": 56, "2018": 60, "2019": 17, "2020": 19, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
