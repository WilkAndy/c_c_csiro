The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb\u2212 1 collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s= 7 TeV. In the diphoton mass range 110\u2013150 GeV, the largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is observed at 126.5 GeV, with a local significance of 2.8 standard deviations. Taking the look-elsewhere effect into account in the range 110\u2013150 GeV, this significance becomes 1.5 standard deviations. The standard model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass ranges of 113\u2013115 GeV and 134.5\u2013136 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 354, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13573914542632665378,1744686261104767572,13320273275857768247,977714951663556551,6664101185369520495,4246023013868171987,12179443573980183239,17994299348054350136,13635671116420149128,10611993753812300960,8332816557278384508,2840989117963740837", "cites_id": ["13573914542632665378", "1744686261104767572", "13320273275857768247", "977714951663556551", "6664101185369520495", "4246023013868171987", "12179443573980183239", "17994299348054350136", "13635671116420149128", "10611993753812300960", "8332816557278384508", "2840989117963740837"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.111803", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IgEh3Vs7YLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 14, "2012": 159, "2013": 74, "2014": 33, "2015": 29, "2016": 21, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
