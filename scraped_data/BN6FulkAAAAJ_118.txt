The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV at the LHC and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 1.08/fb (1.21/fb) in the ee (mumu) channel. No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed and upper limits are set at the 95% C.L. on the cross section times branching ratio of Z' resonances and Randall-Sundrum gravitons decaying into dileptons as a function of the resonance mass. A lower mass limit of 1.83 TeV on the Sequential Standard Model Z' boson is set. A Randall-Sundrum graviton with coupling k/M_Pl=0.1 is excluded at 95% C.L. for masses below 1.63 TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 344, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9197205059812273697,8736091765639574345,17205722119944421752,7115812364031366316", "cites_id": ["9197205059812273697", "8736091765639574345", "17205722119944421752", "7115812364031366316"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1582", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IS6J5EUJo38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 44, "2012": 133, "2013": 65, "2014": 33, "2015": 26, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 12, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
