The measurement covers the pseudorapidity ranges |\u03b7|<1.37 and 1.52\u2a7d|\u03b7|<2.37 in the transverse energy range 45\u2a7dET<400 GeV. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u22121, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The yields of the signal photons are measured using a data-driven technique, based on the observed distribution of the hadronic energy in a narrow cone around the photon candidate and the photon selection criteria. The results are compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and found to be in good agreement over four orders of magnitude in cross-section."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 338, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15677729609626300544,12547110655595607700,521713296948383102,16381966033142338526,10299884360877641525,3103954835198372896", "cites_id": ["15677729609626300544", "12547110655595607700", "521713296948383102", "16381966033142338526", "10299884360877641525", "3103954835198372896"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311013633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gDBmCgR8ktkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 67, "2013": 58, "2014": 37, "2015": 8, "2016": 36, "2017": 32, "2018": 23, "2019": 26, "2020": 14, "2021": 12, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
