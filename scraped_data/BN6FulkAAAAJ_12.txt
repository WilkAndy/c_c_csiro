Dijet masses up to~ 4.0 TeV have been probed. No resonance-like features have been observed in the dijet mass spectrum, and all angular distributions are consistent with the predictions of QCD. Exclusion limits on six hypotheses of new phenomena have been set at 95% CL in terms of mass or energy scale, as appropriate. These hypotheses include excited quarks below 2.83 TeV, colour octet scalars below 1.86 TeV, heavy W bosons below 1.68 TeV, string resonances below 3.61 TeV, quantum black holes with six extra space-time dimensions for quantum gravity scales below 4.11 TeV, and quark contact interactions below a compositeness scale of 7.6 TeV in a destructive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:-TLX1-BxFiYC", "num_citations": 1984, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2491393547050908996,18024824313339060239,16729968949534369590,7237475093745629783,12159291689375749554,2887032493070882476,6356764624437676356,7002439371836982649,18259392417560785635,11487124909380806848,5892643560942527478", "cites_id": ["2491393547050908996", "18024824313339060239", "16729968949534369590", "7237475093745629783", "12159291689375749554", "2887032493070882476", "6356764624437676356", "7002439371836982649", "18259392417560785635", "11487124909380806848", "5892643560942527478"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP01(2013)029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RH2rJzs1kyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 140, "2014": 411, "2015": 415, "2016": 239, "2017": 242, "2018": 183, "2019": 103, "2020": 59, "2021": 75, "2022": 76, "2023": 24}}
