This analysis uses 20.3 fb\u2212 1 of pp collision data at TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The sensitivity of the search is enhanced by considering the number of b-tagged jets and the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets in an event. No evidence is found for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in the context of various simplified supersymmetry-inspired models where gluinos are pair produced, as well as an mSUGRA/CMSSM model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:9UF2BbDYXHIC", "num_citations": 332, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7237475093745629783,7247414738570548617,10136561262786706659,16579608813625738904,14535007120458014979", "cites_id": ["7237475093745629783", "7247414738570548617", "10136561262786706659", "16579608813625738904", "14535007120458014979"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2013)130", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V_pxgUCtcGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 79, "2015": 106, "2016": 51, "2017": 31, "2018": 24, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
