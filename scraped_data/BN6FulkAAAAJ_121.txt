The data used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb-1 collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. In the diphoton mass range 110-150 GeV, the largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is observed at 126.5 GeV, with a local significance of 2.8 standard deviations. Taking the look-elsewhere effect into account in the range 110-150 GeV, this significance becomes 1.5 standard deviations. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass ranges of 113-115 GeV and 134.5-136 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 332, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1329235216936601336,13573914542632665378,4246023013868171987", "cites_id": ["1329235216936601336", "13573914542632665378", "4246023013868171987"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1414", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-AZyIGNkchIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 174, "2013": 72, "2014": 44, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
