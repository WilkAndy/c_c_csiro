The data are selected from pp collisions at recorded by the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb\u2212 1. The observed data are consistent with expectations from Standard Model processes. Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the cross section of new sources of same-sign top-quark pair production of 1.4-2.0 pb depending on the assumed mediator mass. Upper limits are also set on the pair-production cross-section for new heavy down-type quarks; a lower limit of 450 GeV is set at 95% confidence level on the mass of heavy down-type quarks under the assumption that they decay 100% of the time to W t."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Ef4XXjhdXvQC", "num_citations": 327, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12357911474837243800,17539665876382217778,1884750049465315899,16496499831183192152,3306654015440570738,5317006117602863273", "cites_id": ["12357911474837243800", "17539665876382217778", "1884750049465315899", "16496499831183192152", "3306654015440570738", "5317006117602863273"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP04(2012)069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mMdl5wIfgKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 72, "2013": 85, "2014": 59, "2015": 47, "2016": 23, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
