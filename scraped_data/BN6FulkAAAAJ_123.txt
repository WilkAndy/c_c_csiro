Candidate events are selected in the dilepton topology with large missing transverse energy and at least two jets. Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u22121, a tt\u00af production cross section \u03c3tt\u00af=177\u00b120(stat.)\u00b114(syst.)\u00b17(lum.) pb is measured for an assumed top quark mass of mt=172.5 GeV. A second measurement requiring at least one jet identified as coming from a b quark yields a comparable result, demonstrating that the dilepton final states are consistent with being accompanied by b-quark jets. These measurements are in good agreement with Standard Model predictions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:oMtqKo3K3HAC", "num_citations": 319, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3203021004966653583,18243547571084932431", "cites_id": ["3203021004966653583", "18243547571084932431"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311015231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j-4mOaJqcywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 115, "2013": 38, "2014": 25, "2015": 18, "2016": 27, "2017": 46, "2018": 10, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 3}}
