Jets are identified using the anti-k  t  algorithm with two radius parameters of 0.4 and 0.6. The inclusive jet double-differential cross-section is presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum p T and jet rapidity y, covering a range of 20\u2264p T<430 GeV and |y|<4.4. The ratio of the cross-section to the inclusive jet cross-section measurement at , published by the ATLAS Collaboration, is calculated as a function of both transverse momentum and the dimensionless quantity , in bins of jet rapidity. The systematic uncertainties on the ratios are significantly reduced due to the cancellation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Lpa4s8qvUTIC", "num_citations": 313, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11372753738928367652,1112361694258025574,12630515145741617865,2380503081801589386,5035543086847780215,12378764258793124652", "cites_id": ["11372753738928367652", "1112361694258025574", "12630515145741617865", "2380503081801589386", "5035543086847780215", "12378764258793124652"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2509-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JCjSJkUj1J0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 19, "2014": 51, "2015": 77, "2016": 50, "2017": 44, "2018": 24, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 20, "2023": 2}}
