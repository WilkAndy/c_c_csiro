The analysis is based on the selection of the dileptonic final states with events featuring two isolated leptons, electron or muon, with significant transverse missing momentum and at least one jet. An approach based on boosted decision trees has been developed to improve the discrimination of single top-quark Wt events from background. A template fit to the final classifier distributions is performed to determine the cross-section. The result is incompatible with the background-only hypothesis at the 3.3\u03c3 level, the expected sensitivity assuming the Standard Model production rate being 3.4\u03c3. The corresponding cross-section is determined and found to be \u03c3Wt=16.8\u00b12.9 (stat)\u00b14.9 (syst) pb, in good agreement with the Standard Model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 302, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8220862386155686677,16115346969255303919,4306474297587117910,18442572058576651245", "cites_id": ["8220862386155686677", "16115346969255303919", "4306474297587117910", "18442572058576651245"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312008489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FQsuwsheFnIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 26, "2013": 71, "2014": 49, "2015": 32, "2016": 30, "2017": 11, "2018": 37, "2019": 16, "2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
