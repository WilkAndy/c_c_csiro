Candidate events have a signature consistent with containing two isolated leptons, large missing transverse momentum, and at least two jets. Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.70 fb\u2212 1, a t production cross section pb is measured for an assumed top-quark mass of m t= 172. 5 GeV. This measurement is in good agreement with Standard Model predictions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:pk6FPx6l9xIC", "num_citations": 299, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1853800741446616544,9585984309857867950", "cites_id": ["1853800741446616544", "9585984309857867950"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP05(2012)059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4AVI1vMFuhkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 67, "2013": 64, "2014": 43, "2015": 35, "2016": 29, "2017": 34, "2018": 7, "2019": 15, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
