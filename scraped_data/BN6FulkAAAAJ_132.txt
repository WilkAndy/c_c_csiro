The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12 fb(-1) of root s = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass (m(gamma gamma)) spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used. The results also set 95% CL lower limits on the lightest Randall-Sundrum graviton mass of between 0.79 and 1.85 TeV, for values of the dimensionless coupling k/(M) over bar (Pl) varying from 0.01 to 0.1. Combining with previously published ATLAS results from the dielectron and dimuon final states, the 95% CL lower limit on the Randall-Sundrum graviton mass for k/(M) over bar (Pl) = 0.01 (0.1) is 0.80 (1.95) TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:yRRszJvrVdAC", "num_citations": 290, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1647839654395031878,13307814092493228998,12572656595895527424,11103399396359048432", "cites_id": ["1647839654395031878", "13307814092493228998", "12572656595895527424", "11103399396359048432"], "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/36378", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RrEEX29N3hYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 37, "2016": 19, "2017": 21, "2018": 15, "2019": 17, "2020": 13, "2021": 62, "2022": 57, "2023": 17}}
