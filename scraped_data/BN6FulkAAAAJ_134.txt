Two x\u2010ray probes are used to collect \u03bc\u2010XRF and \u03bc\u2010XANES for elemental and chemical microanalysis: a Kirkpatrick\u2010Baez mirror microprobe for micron resolution studies and a Fresnel zone plate nanoprobe capable of 60\u2010nm resolution. Some unique aspects of the beamline design and operation are discussed. An advanced energy dispersive x\u2010ray fluorescence detection scheme named Maia has been developed for the beamline, which enables ultrafast x\u2010ray fluorescence microscopy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 282, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5421319198242690776", "cites_id": ["5421319198242690776"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3625343", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2NZCYRZlPEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 14, "2013": 14, "2014": 22, "2015": 19, "2016": 29, "2017": 19, "2018": 37, "2019": 38, "2020": 37, "2021": 19, "2022": 21, "2023": 3}}
