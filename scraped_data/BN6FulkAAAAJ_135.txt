The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb\u2212 1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The search is motivated by supersymmetric models that involve strong-production processes and cascade decays of new particles. The resulting final states contain multiple jets as well as missing transverse momentum from weakly interacting particles. The event yields, observed across several kinematic regions, are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric scenarios with pair production of gluinos, where each gluino decays to a top quark\u2013antiquark pair and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 276, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2328848711328238590,1005356332347468990,12413694834998658546,14822982416679097550", "cites_id": ["2328848711328238590", "1005356332347468990", "12413694834998658546", "14822982416679097550"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931400255X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_otYbpC7USAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 27, "2012": 47, "2013": 10, "2014": 62, "2015": 57, "2016": 27, "2017": 21, "2018": 13, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
