Based on an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb\u2212 1, the differential cross-section in the Z/\u03b3\u204e\u2192 e+ e\u2212 channel is measured with the ATLAS detector as a function of the invariant mass, m e e, in the range 116< m e e< 1500 GeV, for a fiducial region in which both the electron and the positron have transverse momentum p T> 25 GeV and pseudorapidity| \u03b7|< 2.5. A comparison is made to various event generators and to the predictions of perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:cLw937zWwQcC", "num_citations": 266, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16813641708912518680", "cites_id": ["16813641708912518680"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269313006138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GCZsQA0OVukJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 15, "2014": 36, "2015": 58, "2016": 35, "2017": 37, "2018": 20, "2019": 16, "2020": 5, "2021": 21, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
