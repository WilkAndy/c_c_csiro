Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb\u2212 1, these states are reconstructed through their radiative decays to \u03a5 (1 S, 2 S) with \u03a5\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212. In addition to the mass peaks corresponding to the decay modes \u03c7 b (1 P, 2 P)\u2192 \u03a5 (1 S) \u03b3, a new structure centered at a mass of 10.530\u00b10.005 (stat)\u00b10.009 (syst) GeV is also observed, in both the \u03a5 (1 S) \u03b3 and \u03a5 (2 S) \u03b3 decay modes.
