Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k  t  algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta p T\u226520 GeV and pseudorapidities |\u03b7|<4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 253, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10453278624258980252,8611367672164492354,5873290768471964320,13672840993907307641,12378764258793124652,12183344726332215671,9582163425444559904,8010625322337405287,5376254142181171567", "cites_id": ["10453278624258980252", "8611367672164492354", "5873290768471964320", "13672840993907307641", "12378764258793124652", "12183344726332215671", "9582163425444559904", "8010625322337405287", "5376254142181171567"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2304-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nPkjYYaBEZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 63, "2013": 29, "2014": 29, "2015": 32, "2016": 32, "2017": 13, "2018": 13, "2019": 16, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
