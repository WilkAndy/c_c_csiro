The analysis is based on 20.3 fb\u2212 1 of= 8 TeV proton-proton collision data delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded with the ATLAS detector. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model expectations and limits are set in R-parity-conserving phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Models and in simplified supersymmetric models, significantly extending previous results. For simplified supersymmetric models of direct chargino and next-to-lightest neutralino production with decays to lightest neutralino via either all three generations of sleptons, staus only, gauge bosons, or Higgs bosons, and masses are excluded up to 700 GeV, 380 GeV, 345 GeV, or 148 GeV respectively, for a massless."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 1939, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4564963492334241828,16509795408342704068,4535550908752954636,3509957370147615904,3589591243910227461,86649158201621403,18201022596690681899,15794844690593801016,4782149096559349953,7247414738570548617,14103427214896041767,9896025009449985114,5464272183260102683,1428277883964128111,1268307981814420820,6556206463796880325,2445635567353078003", "cites_id": ["4564963492334241828", "16509795408342704068", "4535550908752954636", "3509957370147615904", "3589591243910227461", "86649158201621403", "18201022596690681899", "15794844690593801016", "4782149096559349953", "7247414738570548617", "14103427214896041767", "9896025009449985114", "5464272183260102683", "1428277883964128111", "1268307981814420820", "6556206463796880325", "2445635567353078003"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP04(2014)169", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JIg1LRwCWj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 16, "2013": 46, "2014": 253, "2015": 436, "2016": 383, "2017": 255, "2018": 205, "2019": 96, "2020": 81, "2021": 76, "2022": 62, "2023": 23}}
