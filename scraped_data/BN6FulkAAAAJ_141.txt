Photons are reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range| \u03b7 \u03b3|< 1.37 and with a transverse energy E T \u03b3> 25 GeV. Jets are reconstructed in the rapidity range| y jet|< 4.4 and with a transverse momentum p T jet> 20 GeV. The differential cross section d \u03c3/d E T \u03b3 is measured, as a function of the photon transverse energy, for three different rapidity ranges of the leading-p T jet:| y jet|< 1.2, 1.2\u2264| y jet|< 2.8 and 2.8\u2264| y jet|< 4.4. For each rapidity configuration the same-sign (\u03b7 \u03b3 y jet\u2265 0) and opposite-sign (\u03b7 \u03b3 y jet< 0) cases are studied separately. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 37 pb\u2212 1, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations are found to be in fair agreement with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 247, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15393389361933237369,17089804323296462901,10307359120465298924,8615251784355694951,8098093961655041712,4923765085984152314", "cites_id": ["15393389361933237369", "17089804323296462901", "10307359120465298924", "8615251784355694951", "8098093961655041712", "4923765085984152314"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.85.092014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ebxOJxFOoNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 21, "2013": 73, "2014": 22, "2015": 18, "2016": 23, "2017": 25, "2018": 27, "2019": 19, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
