Events are selected with a single lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum and at least four jets of which at least one jet is identified as coming from a b-quark. A kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the t \u00aft event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The measured value of AC is AC =\u22120.019\u00b10.028 (stat.)\u00b10.024 (syst.), consistent with the prediction from the MC@NLO Monte Carlo generator of AC = 0.006\u00b10.002. Measurements of AC in two ranges of invariant mass of the top-antitop pair are also shown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:_u2aKJ9e-CoC", "num_citations": 244, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1783753979756688926,18126310811517486473,9271551167197875940,16983124777691296180,8666605402617909292,2988042227089130078,2666523055065258884", "cites_id": ["1783753979756688926", "18126310811517486473", "9271551167197875940", "16983124777691296180", "8666605402617909292", "2988042227089130078", "2666523055065258884"], "pub_url": "https://iris.unipv.it/handle/11571/449410", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HjYWOssqwRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 51, "2013": 38, "2014": 27, "2015": 22, "2016": 23, "2017": 23, "2018": 12, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
