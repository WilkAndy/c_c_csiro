The ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) end-caps have a total of about 3million electronics channels each reading out every 25ns into its own on-chip 3.3\u03bcs buffer. The highest anticipated dose after 10 years operation is 1.4\u00d71014cm-2 in units of 1MeV neutron equivalent (assuming the damage factors scale with the non-ionising energy loss). The forward tracker has 1976 double-sided modules, mostly of area \u223c70cm2, each having 2\u00d7768 strips read out by six ASICs per side. The requirement to achieve an average perpendicular radiation length of 1.5% X0, while coping with up to 7W dissipation per module (after irradiation), leads to stringent constraints on the thermal design. The additional requirement of 1500e- equivalent noise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 243, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1185077914746548228", "cites_id": ["1185077914746548228"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900207003270", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BPCgqxU-chAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 14, "2008": 23, "2009": 17, "2010": 23, "2011": 26, "2012": 13, "2013": 14, "2014": 17, "2015": 22, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 18, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
