The integrated luminosities used from  collisions at  and 8 TeV are 4.7 and 20.3 fb, respectively. The processes considered are associated  production, where ,  and . The observed (expected) deviation from the background-only hypothesis corresponds to a significance of 1.4 (2.6) standard deviations and the ratio of the measured signal yield to the Standard Model expectation is found to be  for a Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV. The analysis procedure is validated by a measurement of the yield of  production with  in the same final states as for the Higgs boson search, from which the ratio of the observed signal yield to the Standard Model expectation is found to be ."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:3AIi9tQMIrsC", "num_citations": 1867, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13047861336793818538,1780394223698850618,12558627817911755648,14448278653324955914,10816010928215822033,11207634135711919624,9524203603039092384,7525768067361960516,13894687351089586026,15958380684913156805,931598391500498361,13881760217619222488", "cites_id": ["13047861336793818538", "1780394223698850618", "12558627817911755648", "14448278653324955914", "10816010928215822033", "11207634135711919624", "9524203603039092384", "7525768067361960516", "13894687351089586026", "15958380684913156805", "931598391500498361", "13881760217619222488"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6212", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qiUmWsFQE7UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 73, "2014": 125, "2015": 320, "2016": 382, "2017": 275, "2018": 236, "2019": 161, "2020": 71, "2021": 104, "2022": 80, "2023": 20}}
