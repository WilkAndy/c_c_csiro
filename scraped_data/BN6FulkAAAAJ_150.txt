Results are presented based on the analysis of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb\u22121. No excess above Standard Model expectations is observed. A W\u2032 with Sequential Standard Model couplings is excluded at the 95% confidence level for masses up to 2.15 TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 241, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10556559316225611606,17852489881290954811", "cites_id": ["10556559316225611606", "17852489881290954811"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311011932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vtf3XcRugJIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 14, "2012": 119, "2013": 44, "2014": 21, "2015": 17, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
