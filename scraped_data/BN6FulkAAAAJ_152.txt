One neutral B meson is reconstructed in the J/\u03c8 K S, \u03c8 (2 S) K S, \u03c7 c 1 K S, \u03b7 c K S, J/\u03c8 K L, or J/\u03c8 \u03c0 0 CP-eigenstate decay channel and the flavor of the accompanying B meson is identified from its charged particle decay products. From the asymmetry in the distribution of the time interval between the two B-meson decay points, we determine sin 2 \u03c6 1= 0.58\u2212 0.34+ 0.32 (stat)\u2212 0.10+ 0.09 (syst)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 236, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7392248077727014377,476421265204498477,16613868301981302229", "cites_id": ["7392248077727014377", "476421265204498477", "16613868301981302229"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.2509", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Z17_HWKlmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 67, "2002": 46, "2003": 9, "2004": 19, "2005": 12, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
