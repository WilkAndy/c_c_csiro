The LHC is designed with a maximum bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz and the ATLAS trigger system is designed to record approximately 200 of these per second. The trigger system selects events by rapidly identifying signatures of muon, electron, photon, tau lepton, jet, and B meson candidates, as well as using global event signatures, such as missing transverse energy. An overview of the ATLAS trigger system, the evolution of the system during 2010 and the performance of the trigger system components and selections based on the 2010 collision data are shown. A brief outline of plans for the trigger system in 2011 is presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:XJogQLJr2CkC", "num_citations": 234, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1783753979756688926,9016257093393470750,8037492879490099474,5743353371983570950", "cites_id": ["1783753979756688926", "9016257093393470750", "8037492879490099474", "5743353371983570950"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1849-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HjYWOssqwRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 51, "2013": 17, "2014": 25, "2015": 22, "2016": 24, "2017": 22, "2018": 14, "2019": 21, "2020": 20, "2021": 11, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
