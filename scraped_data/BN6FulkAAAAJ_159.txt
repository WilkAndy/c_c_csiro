In the t t\u2192 W b W b decay, the lepton plus jets final state is used, where one W boson decays leptonically and the other hadronically. The t t system is reconstructed using both small-radius and large-radius jets, the latter being supplemented by a jet substructure analysis. A search for local excesses in the number of data events compared to the Standard Model expectation in the t t invariant mass spectrum is performed. No evidence for a t t resonance is found and 95% credibility-level limits on the production rate are determined for massive states predicted in two benchmark models.
