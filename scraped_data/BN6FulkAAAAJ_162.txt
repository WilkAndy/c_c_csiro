The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at= 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb\u2212 1. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino, where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Sw8WaQuuSIgC", "num_citations": 211, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16004868427200167838,4782149096559349953,7247414738570548617,4648217665480549102,4582964851448713749,4398796449516211152,17921096386049732068,17661829087870364458,14103427214896041767,6556206463796880325", "cites_id": ["16004868427200167838", "4782149096559349953", "7247414738570548617", "4648217665480549102", "4582964851448713749", "4398796449516211152", "17921096386049732068", "17661829087870364458", "14103427214896041767", "6556206463796880325"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2014)118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nn8hgAm3HN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 60, "2016": 48, "2017": 28, "2018": 35, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
