We present a measurement of the normalized differential cross section based on the full data set (\u222b L d t= 36 pb\u2212 1) acquired by the ATLAS detector during the 2010 s= 7 TeV proton-proton run of the LHC. The measured distributions include jets with transverse momenta up to 1.3 TeV, probing perturbative QCD in a high-energy regime."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 211, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11934358989056569127,15105177628833035384,1618877053493488432,13310157924632268820,6290496614776965494,2413525578075007471", "cites_id": ["11934358989056569127", "15105177628833035384", "1618877053493488432", "13310157924632268820", "6290496614776965494", "2413525578075007471"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.172002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J--0BEVcn6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 26, "2012": 22, "2013": 28, "2014": 18, "2015": 28, "2016": 18, "2017": 12, "2018": 17, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 2, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
