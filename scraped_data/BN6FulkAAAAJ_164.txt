The search is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb\u22121 of pp collisions at  = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Pairs of prompt, isolated, high-p T leptons with the same electric charge (e \u00b1 e \u00b1, e \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1, \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1) are selected, and their invariant mass distribution is searched for a narrow resonance. No significant excess over Standard Model background expectations is observed, and limits are placed on the cross section times branching ratio for pair production of doubly charged Higgs bosons. The masses of doubly charged Higgs bosons are constrained depending on the branching ratio into these leptonic final states.
