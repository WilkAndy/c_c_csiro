Using leptonic decays of oppositely charged W bosons, the total measured cross section is \u03c3(pp\u2192WW)=54.4\u00b14.0(stat.)\u00b13.9(syst.)\u00b12.0(lumi.) pb, consistent with the Standard Model prediction of \u03c3(pp\u2192WW)=44.4\u00b12.8 pb. Limits on anomalous electroweak triple-gauge couplings are extracted from a fit to the transverse-momentum distribution of the leading charged lepton in the event."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 201, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13227376769444531875", "cites_id": ["13227376769444531875"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312005072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o87-FBcVkbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 28, "2013": 32, "2014": 20, "2015": 28, "2016": 16, "2017": 14, "2018": 7, "2019": 21, "2020": 10, "2021": 18, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
