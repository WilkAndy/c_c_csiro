Both decays are expected to occur if \u03bd4 is a component of \u03bd\u03c4. From the analysis of the data collected during the 1996\u20131998 runs with 4.1\u00d71019 protons on target, a single candidate event consistent with background expectations was found. This allows to derive an upper limit on the mixing strength between the heavy neutrino and the tau neutrino in the \u03bd4 mass range from 10 to 190 MeV. Windows between the SN1987a and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis lower limits and our result are still open for future experimental searches. The results obtained are used to constrain an interpretation of the time anomaly observed in the KARMEN1 detector."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8745302214142378169", "cites_id": ["8745302214142378169"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269301003628", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ucBkdweOXXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 10, "2018": 10, "2019": 18, "2020": 18, "2021": 18, "2022": 21, "2023": 14}}
