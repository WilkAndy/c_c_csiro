One neutral B meson is fully reconstructed as a J/\u03c8 K S, \u03c8 (2 S) K S, \u03c7 c 1 K S, \u03b7 c K S, J/\u03c8 K L, or J/\u03c8 K* 0 decay and the flavor of the accompanying B meson is identified from its decay products. From the asymmetry in the distribution of the time intervals between the two B meson decay points, we determine sin 2 \u03c6 1= 0.99\u00b10.14 (stat)\u00b10.06 (syst). We conclude that we have observed CP violation in the neutral B meson system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 1584, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10525800508863968168", "cites_id": ["10525800508863968168"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qHN2c8snE5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 55, "2002": 193, "2003": 141, "2004": 94, "2005": 56, "2006": 70, "2007": 57, "2008": 67, "2009": 50, "2010": 36, "2011": 42, "2012": 52, "2013": 60, "2014": 67, "2015": 57, "2016": 63, "2017": 68, "2018": 60, "2019": 54, "2020": 65, "2021": 50, "2022": 61, "2023": 20}}
