Maia has been deployed initially at the XFM beamline at the Australian Synchrotron and more recently, demonstrating improvements in energy resolution, at the P06 beamline at Petra III in Germany. Maia captures fine detail in element images beyond 100 M pixels. It combines a large solid-angle annular energy-dispersive 384 detector array, stage encoder and flux counter inputs and dedicated FPGA-based real-time event processor with embedded spectral deconvolution. This enables high definition imaging and enhanced trace element sensitivity to capture complex trace element textures and place them in a detailed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C", "num_citations": 196, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=25792172848193735", "cites_id": ["25792172848193735"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/499/1/012002/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xyCaNNihWwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 15, "2017": 22, "2018": 36, "2019": 28, "2020": 31, "2021": 18, "2022": 20, "2023": 9}}
