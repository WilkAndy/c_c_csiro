Cross sections, in both the electron and muon decay modes of the W boson, are presented as a function of jet multiplicity and of the transverse momentum of the leading and next-to-leading jets in the event. Measurements are also presented of the ratio of cross sections sigma(W+ \\ge n) / sigma(W+ \\ge n-1) for inclusive jet multiplicities n=1-4. The results, based on an integrated luminosity of 1.3 pb-1, have been corrected for all known detector effects and are quoted in a limited and well-defined range of jet and lepton kinematics. The measured cross sections are compared to particle-level predictions based on perturbative QCD. Next-to-leading order calculations, studied here for n \\le 2, are found in good agreement with the data. Leading-order multiparton event generators, normalized to the NNLO total cross section, describe the data well for all measured jet multiplicities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15708275816142351701,4329768631373380870,9861258824247976446", "cites_id": ["15708275816142351701", "4329768631373380870", "9861258824247976446"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VS0G96AB_9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 67, "2012": 61, "2013": 36, "2014": 12, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
