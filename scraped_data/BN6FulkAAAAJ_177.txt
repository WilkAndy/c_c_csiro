The number of observed events is consistent with the Standard Model prediction and this result is interpreted in terms of limits on a model of Large Extra Dimensions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 185, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2059298963524950637,4902488017463968867,6674677796918752182", "cites_id": ["2059298963524950637", "4902488017463968867", "6674677796918752182"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5327", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bRo8J38ZlBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 40, "2013": 34, "2014": 8, "2015": 41, "2016": 27, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
