The method is implemented in the GeoPIXE software and applied to cope with the large solid-angle of the new Maia 384 detector array and its 96 detector prototype developed by CSIRO and BNL for SXRF imaging applications at the Australian and NSLS synchrotrons. Peak-to-background is controlled by mitigating charge-sharing between detectors through careful optimization of a patterned molybdenum absorber mask. A geological application demonstrates the capability of the method to produce high definition elemental images up to \u223c100M pixels in size."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 185, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1304981010829057270", "cites_id": ["1304981010829057270"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900209022153", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9pwYtVA5HBIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 10, "2013": 13, "2014": 17, "2015": 19, "2016": 16, "2017": 18, "2018": 19, "2019": 18, "2020": 16, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
