No excess is observed above the estimated background and lower limits, at 95% confidence level, are set on the mass of the long-lived particles in different scenarios, based on their possible interactions in the inner detector, the calorimeters and the muon spectrometer. Long-lived staus in gauge-mediated SUSY-breaking models are excluded up to a mass of 300 GeV for tan beta = 5-20. Directly produced long-lived sleptons are excluded up to a mass of 278 GeV. R-hadrons, composites of gluino (stop, sbottom) and light quarks, are excluded up to a mass of 985 GeV (683 GeV, 612 GeV) when using a generic interaction model. Additionally two sets of limits on R-hadrons are obtained that are less sensitive to the interaction model for R-hadrons. One set of limits is obtained using only the inner detector and calorimeter observables, and a second set of limits is obtained based on the inner detector alone."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=823774492191378421,3754583003804748180,9735570224218201007,14924220861266422981,7807459595177743746,847389510412740122", "cites_id": ["823774492191378421", "3754583003804748180", "9735570224218201007", "14924220861266422981", "7807459595177743746", "847389510412740122"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1597", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9UsYPomibgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 49, "2014": 16, "2015": 54, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 15, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 7}}
