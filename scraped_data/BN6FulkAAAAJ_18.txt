No significant excess beyond Standard Model expectations is observed. Limits are set on the masses of the lightest chargino, next-to-lightest neutralino and sleptons for different lightest-neutralino mass hypotheses in simplified models. Results are also interpreted in various scenarios of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:xUD2GqFNeDMC", "num_citations": 1548, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4564963492334241828,7237475093745629783,3589591243910227461,8496726066671838998,86649158201621403,16004868427200167838,14042791841396027842,7247414738570548617,8423991245982037511,5464272183260102683,11487124909380806848,6556206463796880325", "cites_id": ["4564963492334241828", "7237475093745629783", "3589591243910227461", "8496726066671838998", "86649158201621403", "16004868427200167838", "14042791841396027842", "7247414738570548617", "8423991245982037511", "5464272183260102683", "11487124909380806848", "6556206463796880325"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP05(2014)071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JIg1LRwCWj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 16, "2014": 195, "2015": 374, "2016": 310, "2017": 211, "2018": 167, "2019": 97, "2020": 54, "2021": 50, "2022": 55, "2023": 11}}
