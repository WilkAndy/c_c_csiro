The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u2212 1 and were collected with the ATLAS detector in 2010. Jet mass, width, eccentricity, planar flow and angularity are measured for jets reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm with distance parameters R= 0.6 and 1.0, with transverse momentum p T> 300 GeV and pseudorapidity| \u03b7|< 2. The measurements are compared to the expectations of Monte Carlo generators that match leading-logarithmic parton showers to leading-order, or next-to-leading-order, matrix elements. The generators describe the general features of the jets, although discrepancies are observed in some distributions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9694969731856575233,9335695098565225175", "cites_id": ["9694969731856575233", "9335695098565225175"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.86.072006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Aat535pzi4YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 39, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 33, "2017": 10, "2018": 26, "2019": 24, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
