Measurements of isolated-photon plus jet bin-averaged cross sections are presented as functions of photon transverse energy, jet transverse momentum and jet rapidity. In addition, the bin-averaged cross sections as functions of the difference between the azimuthal angles of the photon and the jet, the photon\u2013jet invariant mass and the scattering angle in the photon\u2013jet centre-of-mass frame have been measured. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations are compared to the measurements and provide a good description of the data, except for the case of the azimuthal opening angle."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:96M4k3P_OWMC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=842831673327132711,2433790402836137767,735347392008029016", "cites_id": ["842831673327132711", "2433790402836137767", "735347392008029016"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321313004057", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J6Ac_vBWsgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 23, "2014": 28, "2015": 8, "2016": 26, "2017": 26, "2018": 27, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
