No significant excess is observed with respect to the prediction for standard model processes. Results are interpreted in a variety of R-parity conserving models in which scalar bottoms and tops are the only scalar quarks to appear in the gluino decay cascade, and in an SO (10) model framework. Gluino masses up to 600\u2013900 GeV are excluded, depending on the model considered."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 173, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4944606446053176521,10844764737974778349", "cites_id": ["4944606446053176521", "10844764737974778349"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.85.112006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yTQbc13FnkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 79, "2013": 59, "2014": 24, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
