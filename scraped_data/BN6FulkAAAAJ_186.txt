Scalar bottom quarks are searched for in events with large missing transverse momentum and two jets in the final state, where both jets are identified as originating from a bottom quark. In an R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric scenario, assuming that the scalar bottom quark decays exclusively into a bottom quark and a neutralino, 95% confidence-level upper limits are obtained in the b 1\u2212 \u03c7 1 0 mass plane such that for neutralino masses below 60 GeV scalar bottom masses up to 390 GeV are excluded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8780751365303441738,14198940380708001917", "cites_id": ["8780751365303441738", "14198940380708001917"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.181802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ShnwJdh-23kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 69, "2013": 46, "2014": 29, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 5}}
