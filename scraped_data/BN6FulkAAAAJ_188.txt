Since W bosons decay to the three lepton generations equally, while H+ maypredominantlydecayinto \u03c4\u03bd, charged Higgs bosons can be searched for using the violation of lepton universality in top quark decays. The analysis in this paper is based on 4.6 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collision data at TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Signatures containing leptons (e or \u03bc) and/or a hadronically decaying \u03c4 (\u03c4 had) are used. Event yield ratios between e+ \u03c4 had and e+ \u03bc, as well as between \u03bc+ \u03c4 had and\u03bc+ e, final states are measured in the data and compared to predictions from simulations. This ratio-based method reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in the analysis.
