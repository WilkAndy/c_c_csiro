The search strategy requires that both long-lived particles decay inside the muon spectrometer. No excess of events is observed above the expected background and limits on the Higgs boson production times branching ratio to weakly interacting, long-lived particles are derived as a function of the particle proper decay length."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12548967603524265196,5636557782250508313,8039439038307533006", "cites_id": ["12548967603524265196", "5636557782250508313", "8039439038307533006"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.251801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7OTyUYzjJq4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 30, "2014": 16, "2015": 44, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 23, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
