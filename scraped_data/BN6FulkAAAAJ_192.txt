The event sample (8087 reconstructed \u039b  's) is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of previous bubble chamber experiments, while the quality of event reconstruction is comparable. We observe negative polarization along the W  -boson direction which is enhanced in the target fragmentation region: P x(x F<0)=\u22120.21\u00b10.04 (stat) \u00b10.02 (sys)  . In the current fragmentation region we find P x(x F>0)=\u22120.09\u00b10.06 (stat) \u00b10.03 (sys)  . These results provide a test of different models describing the nucleon spin composition and the spin transfer mechanisms. A significant transverse polarization (in the direction orthogonal to the \u039b  production plane) has been observed for the first time in a neutrino experiment: P y=\u22120.22\u00b10.03 (stat) \u00b10.01 (sys)  .
