With no assumptions on the intermediate mechanisms, the following three-body branching fractions have been measured for the first time: B (B+\u2192 K+ \u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+)=(55.6\u00b15.8\u00b17. 7)\u00d7 10\u2212 6 and B (B+\u2192 K+ K\u2212 K+)=(35.3\u00b13.7\u00b14. 5)\u00d7 10\u2212 6. We present the first observation of the decay B+\u2192 f 0 (980) K+ with a branching fraction product of B (B+\u2192 f 0 (980) K+)\u00d7 B (f 0 (980)\u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212)=(9.6\u2212 2.3\u2212 1.5\u2212 0.8+ 2.5+ 1.5+ 3.4)\u00d7 10\u2212 6. This is the first reported example of a B meson decay to a scalar pseudoscalar final state.
