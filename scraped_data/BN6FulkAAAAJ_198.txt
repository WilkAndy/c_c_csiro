Three decay channels are considered: ZH->llbb, WH->lvbb, and ZH->vvbb, where l corresponds to an electron or a muon. No evidence for Higgs boson production is observed in a dataset of 7 TeV pp collisions corresponding to 4.7/fb of integrated luminosity collected by ATLAS in 2011. Exclusion limits on Higgs boson production, at the 95% confidence level, of 2.5 to 5.5 times the Standard Model cross section are obtained in the mass range 110 - 130 GeV. The expected exclusion limits range between 2.5 and 4.9 for the same mass interval."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:GUJN1xMjMHAC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8171966869793192263,16802982225817084072", "cites_id": ["8171966869793192263", "16802982225817084072"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0210", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R7lINpKoaHEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 9, "2012": 18, "2013": 43, "2014": 33, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 3, "2018": 12, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
