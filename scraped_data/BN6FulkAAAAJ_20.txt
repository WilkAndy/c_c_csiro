Events were collected using a single-arm minimum-bias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in different regions of phase-space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo models, including a new AMBT1 PYTHIA 6 tune. In all the kinematic regions considered, the particle multiplicities are higher than predicted by the Monte Carlo models. The central charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity, for tracks with pT >100 MeV, is measured to be 3.483 +- 0.009 (stat) +- 0.106 (syst) at sqrt(s) = 0.9 TeV and 5.630 +- 0.003 (stat) +- 0.169 (syst) at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 1435, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4942477728642957459,3129945993008975896,8267741263162358725,14882857664672988549", "cites_id": ["4942477728642957459", "3129945993008975896", "8267741263162358725", "14882857664672988549"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kwALzk41l0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 74, "2011": 181, "2012": 200, "2013": 164, "2014": 140, "2015": 132, "2016": 180, "2017": 118, "2018": 49, "2019": 54, "2020": 48, "2021": 38, "2022": 40, "2023": 11}}
