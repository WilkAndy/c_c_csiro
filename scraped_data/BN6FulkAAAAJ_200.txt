A 96 detector prototype demonstrated the capacity of the system for real\u2010time deconvolution of complex spectral data using an embedded implementation of the Dynamic Analysis method and acquiring highly detailed images up to 77 M pixels spanning large areas of complex mineral sample sections."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2446180603087187866", "cites_id": ["2446180603087187866"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3399266", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mm92T0yU8iEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 8, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 13, "2015": 11, "2016": 14, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
