The measurement is based on a 5.9 fb\u2212 1 data sample collected by the Belle detector at KEKB. The proper-time difference distributions for same-sign and opposite-sign dilepton events are simultaneously fitted to an expression containing \u0394 m d as a free parameter. Using both muons and electrons, we obtain \u0394 m d= 0.463\u00b10.008 (stat)\u00b10.016 (syst) ps\u2212 1. This is the first determination of \u0394 m d from time evolution measurements at the \u03d2 (4 S). We also place limits on possible CPT violations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3081258754910672955", "cites_id": ["3081258754910672955"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O1iDK4PUwioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 11, "2002": 14, "2003": 10, "2004": 18, "2005": 10, "2006": 14, "2007": 11, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 2}}
