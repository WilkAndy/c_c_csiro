The search is conducted in a pp-collision data sample with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 33 pb\u22121 collected in 2010 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. Production of such particles is expected in various scenarios of physics beyond the standard model. We observe no signal and place limits on the production cross-section of supersymmetric particles in an R-parity-violating scenario as a function of the neutralino lifetime. Limits are presented for different squark and neutralino masses, enabling extension of the limits to a variety of other models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4196570702376831501", "cites_id": ["4196570702376831501"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311015255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DYr7xdE2PToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 20, "2013": 21, "2014": 11, "2015": 41, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
