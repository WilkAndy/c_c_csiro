No event is found in the signal region, leading to an upper limit on the production cross section at 95% confidence level of 1.6/\u03f5 fb for Dirac magnetic monopoles with the minimum unit magnetic charge and with mass between 200 GeV and 1500 GeV, where \u03f5 is the monopole reconstruction efficiency. The efficiency \u03f5 is high and uniform in the fiducial region given by pseudorapidity| \u03b7|< 1.37 and transverse kinetic energy 600\u2013700< E kin sin\ufeff \u03b8< 1400 GeV. The minimum value of 700 GeV is for monopoles of mass 200 GeV, whereas the minimum value of 600 GeV is applicable for higher mass monopoles. Therefore, the upper limit on the production cross section at 95% confidence level is 2 fb in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18002360921187857741,5417965612022568047", "cites_id": ["18002360921187857741", "5417965612022568047"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.261803", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TbXGkeA71fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 22, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 16, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 17, "2021": 8, "2022": 15, "2023": 1}}
