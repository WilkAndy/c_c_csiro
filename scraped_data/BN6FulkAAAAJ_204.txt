No excess is observed above the estimated background. Stable \u03c4\u02dc sleptons are excluded at 95% CL up to a mass of 136 GeV, in GMSB models with N5=3, mmessenger=250 TeV, sign(\u03bc)=1 and tan\u03b2=5. Electroweak production of sleptons is excluded up to a mass of 110 GeV. Gluino R-hadrons in a generic interaction model are excluded up to masses of 530 GeV to 544 GeV depending on the fraction of R-hadrons produced as g\u02dc-balls."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9030354285686758262,2822024464921755545,11505844973520061388", "cites_id": ["9030354285686758262", "2822024464921755545", "11505844973520061388"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311009907", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dhtJwmBDUn0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 50, "2013": 28, "2014": 7, "2015": 13, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
