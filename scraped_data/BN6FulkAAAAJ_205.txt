In this Letter, results are presented of a search for events containing one or more such particles, which decay at a significant distance from their production point, using a final state containing charged hadrons and an associated muon. This analysis uses a data sample of proton\u2013proton collisions at s=7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb\u22121 collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. Results are interpreted in the context of R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios. No events in the signal region are observed and limits are set on the production cross section for pair production of supersymmetric particles, multiplied by the square of the branching fraction for a neutralino to decay to charged hadrons and a muon, based on the scenario where both of the produced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3475561000052990354,1057657141077962063,4767766642958990079", "cites_id": ["3475561000052990354", "1057657141077962063", "4767766642958990079"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931300083X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kiFcs1CsOzAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 22, "2014": 19, "2015": 40, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
