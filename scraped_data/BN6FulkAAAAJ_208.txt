After background subtraction we observe 15 344 charm dimuon events, providing the largest sample currently available. The analysis exploits the large inclusive charged current sample\u2013about 9\u00d7 10 6 events after all analysis cuts\u2013and the high resolution NOMAD detector to constrain the total systematic uncertainty on the ratio of charm dimuon to inclusive Charged Current (CC) cross-sections to\u223c 2%. We also perform a fit to the NOMAD data to extract the charm production parameters and the strange quark sea content of the nucleon within the NLO QCD approximation. We obtain a value of m c (m c)= 1.159\u00b10.075 GeV/c 2 for the running mass of the charm quark in the MS\u00af scheme and a strange quark sea suppression factor of \u03ba s= 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7311106505350273948", "cites_id": ["7311106505350273948"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321313004562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nFtzdqFEdmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 17, "2017": 14, "2018": 18, "2019": 14, "2020": 9, "2021": 15, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
