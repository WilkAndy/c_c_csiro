The analysis uses a signal sample of about 2200 \u039b b 0 and \u039bb 0 decays that are reconstructed in 4.9 fb\u2212 1 of ATLAS p p collision data collected in 2011 at the LHC center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. A simultaneous mass and decay time maximum likelihood fit is used to extract the \u039b b 0 lifetime and mass. They are measured to be \u03c4 \u039b b= 1.449\u00b10.036 (stat)\u00b10.017 (syst) ps and m \u039b b= 5619.7\u00b10.7 (stat)\u00b11.1 (syst) MeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11329403804537892298,1106857699084403133,9652891467873591106,7333689463304587784", "cites_id": ["11329403804537892298", "1106857699084403133", "9652891467873591106", "7333689463304587784"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.87.032002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yq1wBrwgOp0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 11, "2013": 24, "2014": 43, "2015": 18, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 11, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
