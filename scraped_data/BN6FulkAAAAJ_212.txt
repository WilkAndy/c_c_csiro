Data collected in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC, with a minimum bias trigger, are used for comparisons with simulated events. The reconstructed secondary vertices have spatial resolutions ranging from\u223c 200\u03bcm to 1 mm. The overall material description in the simulation is validated to within an experimental uncertainty of about 7%. This will lead to a better understanding of the reconstruction of various objects such as tracks, leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ho-XXoYWL80C", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4039360660954346660,8024907518495249651,12483526230934749573", "cites_id": ["4039360660954346660", "8024907518495249651", "12483526230934749573"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/7/01/P01013/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pPTeox6xDjgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 33, "2014": 13, "2015": 6, "2016": 31, "2017": 13, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
