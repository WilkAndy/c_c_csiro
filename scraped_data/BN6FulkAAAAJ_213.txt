The search for a narrow resonance in the WW or WZ mass distribution is conducted in a final state with an electron or a muon, missing transverse momentum and at least two jets. No significant excess is observed and limits are set using three benchmark models: WW resonance masses below 940 GeV and 710 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for spin-2 Randall-Sundrum and bulk Randall-Sundrum gravitons, respectively; WZ resonance masses below 950 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a spin-1 Extended Gauge Model W' boson."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:YEBtnu9hOHUC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12627413983850502483,4335415538927860716,16747824448609708310,14777666886757584021,8463875124425142009,18273102692926376355", "cites_id": ["12627413983850502483", "4335415538927860716", "16747824448609708310", "14777666886757584021", "8463875124425142009", "18273102692926376355"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U5k1ix2WPa8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 31, "2015": 50, "2016": 25, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
