No excess of events was observed above the Standard Model prediction and model-dependent 95% confidence level exclusion limits are set. In the context of a generalised model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with a bino-like lightest neutralino of mass above 50 GeV, gluinos (squarks) below 1.07 TeV (0.87 TeV) are excluded, while a breaking scale Lambda below 196 TeV is excluded for a minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. For a specific model with one universal extra dimension, compactification scales 1/R < 1.40 TeV are excluded. These limits provide the most stringent tests of these models to date."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5760279320581663383,2830708916085115962,15292880157216390400", "cites_id": ["5760279320581663383", "2830708916085115962", "15292880157216390400"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l2pM1oWf8E8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 25, "2013": 30, "2014": 16, "2015": 35, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
