Six event shape variables calculated using hadronic jets are studied in inclusive multi-jet events in 35 pb\u22121 of integrated luminosity at a center-of-mass energy of . These measurements are compared to predictions by three Monte Carlo event generators containing leading-logarithmic parton showers matched to leading order matrix elements for 2\u21922 and 2\u2192n (n=2,\u2026,6) scattering. Measurements of the third-jet resolution parameter, aplanarity, thrust, sphericity, and transverse sphericity are generally well described. The mean value of each event shape variable is evaluated as a function of the average momentum of the two leading jets p T,1 and p T,2, with a mean p T approaching 1 TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:5kvG9DmRKWYC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10604801513403228607,11866202000324829849,1581697819258072299", "cites_id": ["10604801513403228607", "11866202000324829849", "1581697819258072299"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2211-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v6HsL8rSK5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 13, "2014": 10, "2015": 21, "2016": 15, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 10, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
