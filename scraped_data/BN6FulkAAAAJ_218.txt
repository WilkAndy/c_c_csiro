In addition to requiring exactly one lepton, large missing transverse momentum and at least six jets, the invariant mass of nearby jet pairs is used to identify high transverse momentum W bosons. In data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb^-1 from pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector, a heavy down-type quark with mass less than 480 GeV is excluded at the 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11392753264436166895,14750038749848341572", "cites_id": ["11392753264436166895", "14750038749848341572"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6540", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:78BjjLswG54J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 47, "2013": 31, "2014": 12, "2015": 14, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
