In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 1351, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10374830077736851981,11291397268823764147", "cites_id": ["10374830077736851981", "11291397268823764147"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DRqLzPzM-o8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 95, "2012": 164, "2013": 151, "2014": 131, "2015": 145, "2016": 158, "2017": 102, "2018": 112, "2019": 105, "2020": 51, "2021": 50, "2022": 60, "2023": 25}}
