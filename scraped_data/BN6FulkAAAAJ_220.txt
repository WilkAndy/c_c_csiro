The calculation is based on particle production rates computed using a recent version of FLUKA and modified to take into account the cross-sections measured by the SPY and NA20 experiments. These particles are propagated through the beam line taking into account the material and magnetic fields they traverse. The neutrinos produced through their decays are tracked to the NOMAD detector. The fluxes of the four neutrino flavours at NOMAD are predicted with an uncertainty of about 8% for \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bde, 10% for \u03bd \u0304 \u03bc , and 12% for \u03bd \u0304 e . The energy-dependent uncertainty achieved on the \u03bde/\u03bd\u03bc prediction needed for a \u03bd\u03bc\u2192\u03bde oscillation search ranges from 4% to 7%, whereas the overall normalization uncertainty on this ratio is 4.2%."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14823416092432658373", "cites_id": ["14823416092432658373"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900203023349", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xe9B82Vat80J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 19, "2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3}}
