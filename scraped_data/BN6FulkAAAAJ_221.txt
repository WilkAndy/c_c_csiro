No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed and a 95 % confidence level visible cross-section upper limit for new phenomena is set. In the framework of gauge-mediated SUSY-breaking models, lower limits on the mass scale \u039b are set at 54 TeV in the regions where the  is the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (tan\u03b2>20). These limits provide the most stringent tests to date of GMSB models in a large part of the parameter space considered."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hZ5_QnqxF7AC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14864571389780655041,18126310811517486473,6594467151779877522,12633286262718578201", "cites_id": ["14864571389780655041", "18126310811517486473", "6594467151779877522", "12633286262718578201"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2215-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wXtPUuyQSc4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 48, "2014": 28, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
