The b-hadrons are selected by partially reconstructing D*muX final states. Differential cross sections are measured as functions of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. The measured production cross section for a b-hadron with pT>9 GeV and |eta|<2.5 is 32.7 pm 0.8 (stat) ^{+4.5}_{-6.8} (syst) ub, higher than the next-to-leading-order QCD predictions but consistent within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5881326351284371560,18375261727544340247,163583755594073206,16624927081824082665,104562350976998517", "cites_id": ["5881326351284371560", "18375261727544340247", "163583755594073206", "16624927081824082665", "104562350976998517"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aABz6CernlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 11, "2013": 22, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 19, "2017": 19, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
