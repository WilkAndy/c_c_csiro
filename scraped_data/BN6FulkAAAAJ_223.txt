Proton\u2013proton collision data taken at s=7 TeV during the 2011 running period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb\u22121, are analysed. No signal candidates are observed, and 95% confidence level cross-section upper limits are interpreted as mass-exclusion lower limits for a simplified Drell\u2013Yan production model. In this model, masses are excluded from 50 GeV up to 430, 480, 490, 470 and 420 GeV for charges 2e, 3e, 4e, 5e and 6e, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:phXiTgWsA3IC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3558391812755435886,17893819769402767201", "cites_id": ["3558391812755435886", "17893819769402767201"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269313003250", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bjHyIoDyYTEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 18, "2014": 11, "2015": 26, "2016": 9, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
