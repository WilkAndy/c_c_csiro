From a nanotoxicological viewpoint the interaction(s) of ZnO nanoparticles with cells of the immune system is of specific interest, as these nanostructures are readily phagocytosed. In this study, rapid scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy was used to assay the number ZnO nanoparticles associated with \u223c1000 individual THP-1 monocyte-derived human macrophages. These data showed that nanoparticle-treated cells endured a 400% elevation in total Zn levels, 13-fold greater than the increase observed when incubated in the presence of an equitoxic concentration of ZnCl2. Even after excluding the contribution of internalized nanoparticles, Zn levels in nanoparticle treated cells were raised \u223c200% above \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9622795629829461143", "cites_id": ["9622795629829461143"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn403118u", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l5QqPqQJi4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 11, "2015": 16, "2016": 20, "2017": 13, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
