The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to 1.6 fb\u2212 1 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 at s= 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Muon pairs are selected by requiring two isolated muons of the same electric charge with p T> 20 GeV and| \u03b7|< 2.5. Minimal requirements are placed on the rest of the event activity. The distribution of the invariant mass of the muon pair m (\u03bc \u03bc) is found to agree well with the background expectation. Upper limits on the cross section for anomalous production of two muons with the same electric charge are placed as a function of m (\u03bc \u03bc) within a fiducial region defined by the event selection. The fiducial cross-section limit constrains the like-sign top-quark pair-production cross section to be below 3.7 pb at 95% confidence level.
