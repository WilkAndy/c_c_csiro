Supersymmetric gluino pair production in the context of a model with R-parity violation is used as a benchmark scenario. The analysis is divided into two search channels, each optimised separately for their sensitivity to high-mass and low-mass gluino production. The first search channel uses a stringent selection on the transverse momentum of the six leading jets and is performed as a counting experiment. The second search channel focuses on low-mass gluinos produced with a large boost. Large-radius jets are selected and the invariant mass of each of the two leading jets is used as a discriminant between the signal and the background. The results are found to be consistent with Standard Model expectations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:SyxJh60XUSQC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=876091400564477617,16496499831183192152", "cites_id": ["876091400564477617", "16496499831183192152"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP12(2012)086", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sY5rsXyAKAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 28, "2014": 28, "2015": 22, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 7}}
