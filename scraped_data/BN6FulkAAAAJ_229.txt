The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12 fb^-1 of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used. The results also set 95% CL lower limits on the lightest Randall-Sundrum graviton mass of between 0.79 and 1.85 TeV, for values of the dimensionless coupling k/\\bar{M}_{Pl} varying from 0.01 to 0.1. Combining with previously published ATLAS results from the dielectron and dimuon final states, the 95% CL lower limit on the Randall-Sundrum graviton mass for k/\\bar{M}_{Pl} = 0.01 (0.1) is 0.80 (1.95) TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7259737261807631345,12264412559720293326", "cites_id": ["7259737261807631345", "12264412559720293326"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2194", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8fu1bJPEv2QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 34, "2013": 24, "2014": 17, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
