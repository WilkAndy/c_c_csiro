The efficiencies of the triggers for selecting displaced decays as a function of the decay position are presented for simulated events. The effect of pile-up interactions on the trigger efficiencies and the dependence of the trigger rate on instantaneous luminosity during the 2012 data-taking period at the LHC are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:_S7C8mKT2SoC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4545283798696311695", "cites_id": ["4545283798696311695"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2284", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j7uhcIgXFD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 21, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 14, "2020": 16, "2021": 9, "2022": 16, "2023": 2}}
