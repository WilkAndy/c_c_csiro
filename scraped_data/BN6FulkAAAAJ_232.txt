The measurements are performed in the region |eta| < 4.8 for two event classes: those requiring the presence of particles with a low transverse momentum and those requiring particles with a significant transverse momentum. In the second dataset measurements are made in the region transverse to the hard scatter. The distributions are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators, which generally tend to underestimate the amount of transverse energy at high |eta|."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Qs68GpkTGbMC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14349277131228315584,18426721639145374853", "cites_id": ["14349277131228315584", "18426721639145374853"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.6256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wP9_bobfIscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 15, "2014": 20, "2015": 12, "2016": 29, "2017": 14, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
