The four-lepton invariant mass distribution is compared with Standard Model background expectations to derive upper limits on the cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass between 110 GeV and 600 GeV. The mass ranges 134\u2013156 GeV, 182\u2013233 GeV, 256\u2013265 GeV and 268\u2013415 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level. The largest upward deviations from the background-only hypothesis are observed for Higgs boson masses of 125 GeV, 244 GeV and 500 GeV with local significances of 2.1, 2.2 and 2.1 standard deviations, respectively. Once the look-elsewhere effect is considered, none of these excesses are significant."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3699397998520557565,14037328223775866049", "cites_id": ["3699397998520557565", "14037328223775866049"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312002560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_d-bIOHmVjMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 52, "2013": 22, "2014": 13, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
