The measurement is based on 1.04 fb\u2212 1 of data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Contributions to this final state may arise from a number of standard model extensions. The results are interpreted in terms of a model where new top-quark partners are pair produced and each decay to an on-shell top (or antitop) quark and a long-lived undetected neutral particle. The data are found to be consistent with standard model expectations. A limit at 95% confidence level is set excluding a cross section times branching ratio of 1.1 pb for a top-partner mass of 420 GeV and a neutral particle mass less than 10 GeV. In a model of exotic fourth generation quarks, top-partner masses are excluded up to 420 GeV and neutral particle masses up to 140 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12886801720859230661,4015038682340458546,2870092176050397032", "cites_id": ["12886801720859230661", "4015038682340458546", "2870092176050397032"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.041805", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xQG1TuMd17IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 48, "2013": 19, "2014": 11, "2015": 4, "2016": 10, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
