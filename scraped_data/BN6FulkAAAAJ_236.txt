The search is sensitive to both charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) processes, pp\u2192Qq\u2192Wqq\u2032 and pp\u2192Qq\u2192Zqq\u2032 with a leptonic decay of the vector gauge boson. In 1.04 fb\u22121 of data taken in 2011 by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy s=7 TeV, no evidence of such heavy vector-like quarks is observed above the expected Standard Model background. Limits on the heavy vector-like quark production cross section times branching ratio as a function of mass mQ are obtained. For a coupling \u03baqQ=v/mQ, where v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value, 95% C.L. lower limits on the mass of a vector-like quark are set at 900 GeV and 760 GeV from CC and NC processes, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2068592533466977540", "cites_id": ["2068592533466977540"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312003802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BBVTBvMdtRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 17, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 18, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
