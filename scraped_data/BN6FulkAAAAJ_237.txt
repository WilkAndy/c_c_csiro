The measurement has been designed to maximise cancellation of experimental and theoretical uncertainties, and is reported both within a particle-level kinematic range corresponding to the detector acceptance and as a total cross-section ratio. Results are obtained with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using an integrated luminosity of 33 pb\u22121. The results are compared with perturbative leading-order, leading-log, and next-to-leading-order QCD predictions, and are found to agree within experimental and theoretical uncertainties. The ratio is measured for events with a single jet with pT>30 GeV to be 8.73\u00b10.30(stat)\u00b10.40(syst) in the electron channel, and 8.49\u00b10.23(stat)\u00b10.33(syst) in the muon channel."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4162120513880676503,5358027457006360637,10005509953211226129,9509142196966969955,7453172334077155039,15474068058073356857,14801786484052747225,802986298322304331", "cites_id": ["4162120513880676503", "5358027457006360637", "10005509953211226129", "9509142196966969955", "7453172334077155039", "15474068058073356857", "14801786484052747225", "802986298322304331"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200055X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l1g5No7SwjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 25, "2013": 25, "2014": 13, "2015": 16, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
