One of the technique\u2019s unique strengths is the ability to reveal metal distributions in the pigments of underlying brushstrokes, thus providing information critical to the interpretation of a painting. We have applied the nondestructive technique with the event-mode Maia X-ray detector, which has the capability to record elemental maps at megapixels per hour with the full X-ray fluorescence spectrum collected per pixel. The painting poses a difficult challenge to conventional X-ray analysis, because it was completely obscured with heavy brushstrokes of highly X-ray absorptive lead white paint (2PbCO3\u00b7Pb(OH)2) by the artist, making it an excellent candidate for the application of the synchrotron-based technique.
