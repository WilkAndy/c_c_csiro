The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The presence of additional HF (b or c) quarks in the t t sample is inferred by looking for events with at least three b-tagged jets, where two are attributed to the b quarks from the t t decays and the third to additional HF production. The dominant background to t t+ HF in this sample is t t+ jet events in which a light-flavor jet is misidentified as a heavy-flavor jet. To determine the heavy-and light-flavor content of the additional b-tagged jets, a fit to the vertex mass distribution of b-tagged jets in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Dq_Ke-OEjMgC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=649030757196803641,16440261682234426943", "cites_id": ["649030757196803641", "16440261682234426943"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.072012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Oa4E8wjSAQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 9, "2015": 24, "2016": 13, "2017": 6, "2018": 13, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
