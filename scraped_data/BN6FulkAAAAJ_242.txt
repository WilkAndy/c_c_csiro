No excess beyond Standard Model expectations is observed, and upper limits on the fiducial cross sections for non-Standard Model production of these final states are set. Using models for string ball and black hole production and decay, exclusion contours are determined as a function of mass threshold and the fundamental gravity scale."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17921993071624645290,6235219765420021184,1971151425299117470", "cites_id": ["17921993071624645290", "6235219765420021184", "1971151425299117470"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312008465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:quoybb61t_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 19, "2014": 22, "2015": 11, "2016": 15, "2017": 9, "2018": 9}}
