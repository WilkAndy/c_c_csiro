The search uses a set of variables carrying information on the event kinematics transverse and parallel to the beam line that are sensitive to several topologies expected in supersymmetry. Mutually exclusive final states are defined, allowing a combination of all channels to increase the search sensitivity. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on fiducial cross-sections for the production of new particles are extracted. Results are interpreted in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model and in supersymmetry-inspired models with diverse, high-multiplicity final states."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:kOdZbmsmKqcC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15754275889371283307,1112361694258025574,2380503081801589386,12378764258793124652", "cites_id": ["15754275889371283307", "1112361694258025574", "2380503081801589386", "12378764258793124652"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a_95n3NuotoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 15, "2014": 18, "2015": 27, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
