Using 11.1\u00d7106B B \u0304  pairs collected with the Belle detector, we find BF(B+\u2192\u03b7\u2032K+)=(79+12\u221211\u00b19)\u00d710\u22126 and BF(B0\u2192\u03b7\u2032K0)=(55+19\u221216\u00b18)\u00d710\u22126, where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic, respectively. No signal is observed in the mode B+\u2192\u03b7\u2032\u03c0+, and we set a 90% confidence level upper limit of BF(B+\u2192\u03b7\u2032\u03c0+)<7\u00d710\u22126. The CP asymmetry in B\u00b1\u2192\u03b7\u2032K\u00b1 decays is investigated and a limit at 90% confidence level of \u22120.20<ACP<0.32 is obtained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:8lfAJX-aphsC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12544641971962045846", "cites_id": ["12544641971962045846"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269301010255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:luVAvWiFF64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 19, "2003": 18, "2004": 20, "2005": 12, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
