Cross sections are measured differentially in terms of \u0394\u03b7  F , the larger of the pseudorapidity regions extending to the limits of the ATLAS sensitivity, at \u03b7=\u00b14.9, in which no final state particles are produced above a transverse momentum threshold . The measurements span the region 0<\u0394\u03b7  F <8 for $200 \\mbox{~MeV}< p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm {cut}} < 800 \\mbox{~MeV}$. At small \u0394\u03b7  F , the data test the reliability of hadronisation models in describing rapidity and transverse momentum fluctuations in final state particle production. The measurements at larger gap sizes are dominated by contributions from the single diffractive dissociation process \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:KPyiLlrqTgMC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6108047193393844018,8000143373411929551,7573268589989142583", "cites_id": ["6108047193393844018", "8000143373411929551", "7573268589989142583"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-1926-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ms-PgY8kxFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 17, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
