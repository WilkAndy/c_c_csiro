A total of 2714 neutrino- and 115 antineutrino-induced opposite sign dimuon events with E\u03bc1,E\u03bc2>4.5 GeV, 15<E\u03bd<300 GeV and Q 2>1 ( GeV / c ) 2 are observed in the Front-Calorimeter of NOMAD during the 1995 and 1996 runs. The analysis yields a value for the charm quark mass of m c=1.3 +0.3+0.3\u22120.3\u22120.3GeV / c 2 and for the average semileptonic branching ratio of Bc=0.095+0.007+0.014\u22120.007\u22120.013. The ratio of the strange to non-strange sea in the nucleon is measured to be \u03ba=0.48+0.09+0.17\u22120.07\u22120.12. The measured rate of charm-induced dimuon relative to single muon, as a function of neutrino energy, is consistent with the slow rescaling hypothesis of heavy quark production."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3801539899948959099", "cites_id": ["3801539899948959099"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269300006122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e4Xux2XIwTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 11, "2002": 14, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
