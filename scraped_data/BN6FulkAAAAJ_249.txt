The data, corresponding to 2.0 fb\u2212 1 of integrated luminosity, were collected from p p collisions at s= 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Using events with a b-tagged jet and a Z boson reconstructed from opposite-charge electrons, the mass distribution of large transverse momentum b\u2032 candidates is tested for an enhancement. No evidence for a b\u2032 signal is detected in the observed mass distribution, resulting in the exclusion at a 95% confidence level of b\u2032 quarks with masses m b\u2032< 400 GeV that decay entirely via b\u2032\u2192 Z+ b. In the case of a vectorlike singlet b\u2032 mixing solely with the third standard model generation, masses m b\u2032< 358 GeV are excluded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10028679198546876712,16145895462731760702,10235686971133555922", "cites_id": ["10028679198546876712", "16145895462731760702", "10235686971133555922"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.071801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KFm8y5gGLYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 20, "2014": 15, "2015": 13, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
