The search is based on 1.04 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collisions at s= 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analyzed in the lepton+ jets final state, characterized by a high transverse momentum isolated electron or muon, high missing transverse momentum, and at least three jets. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is observed. A 95% CL lower limit of 404 GeV is set for the mass of the t\u2032 quark."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=276889586003794339,8593120736393756491,18003557529937952543,4785487270867899051,12110320243131574380", "cites_id": ["276889586003794339", "8593120736393756491", "18003557529937952543", "4785487270867899051", "12110320243131574380"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.261802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o9nCh5y11wMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 41, "2013": 27, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
