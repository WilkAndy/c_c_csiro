The observed distributions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a model-independent way within well-defined phase-space regions. The distribution of the production ratio of \u039b\u0305 to \u039b baryons is also measured. The results are compared with various Monte Carlo simulation models. Although most of these models agree with data to within 15% in the KS0 distributions, substantial disagreements are found in the \u039b distributions of transverse momentum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14169702696304888074,18056113951993063397", "cites_id": ["14169702696304888074", "18056113951993063397"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/59197/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CsklKoflpMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 10, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 12, "2016": 9, "2017": 11, "2018": 2, "2019": 13, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
