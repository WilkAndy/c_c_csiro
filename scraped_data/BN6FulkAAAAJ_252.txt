Events are selected using a minimum bias trigger, allowing jets at very low transverse momentum to be observed and their characteristics in the transition to high-momentum fully perturbative jets to be studied. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm applied to charged particles with two radius parameter choices, 0.4 and 0.6. An inclusive charged jet transverse momentum cross section measurement from 4 GeV to 100 GeV is shown for four ranges in rapidity extending to 1.9 and corrected to charged particle-level truth jets. The transverse momenta and longitudinal momentum fractions of charged particles within jets are measured, along with the charged particle multiplicity and the particle density as a function \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1745919068317787018,14469599352078988919", "cites_id": ["1745919068317787018", "14469599352078988919"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.84.054001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iqOpcSTAOhgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 17, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 13, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
