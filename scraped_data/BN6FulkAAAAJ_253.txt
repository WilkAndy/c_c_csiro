The asymmetry is measured in the  decay mode as a function of the muon pseudorapidity using a data sample corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 31 pb. The results are compared to predictions based on next-to-leading order calculations with various parton distribution functions. This measurement provides information on the  and  quark momentum fractions in the proton."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6290173116557979636,5060275304471454600,1171791771146722306", "cites_id": ["6290173116557979636", "5060275304471454600", "1171791771146722306"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2929", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9G8mbB8vS1cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 21, "2012": 19, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
