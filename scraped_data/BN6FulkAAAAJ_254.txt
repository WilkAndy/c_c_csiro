The guiding principle in optimising the ATLAS experiment has been maximising the discovery potential for new physics such as Higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles, while keeping the capability of high-accuracy measurements of known objects such as heavy quarks and gauge bosons.The ATLAS subdetectors have been described in separate Technical Design Reports (TDRs), and the construction of the detector has begun. The purpose of this Detector and Physics Performance TDR is to document the expected overall physics performance of ATLAS. This TDR will serve both as a reference for the collaboration members and as an introduction to the ATLAS experiment and its rich physics potential for other physicists."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:wxweM2R62s8C", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11042993830401831098", "cites_id": ["11042993830401831098"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/391176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:unDuZWGYQJkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 17, "2023": 1}}
