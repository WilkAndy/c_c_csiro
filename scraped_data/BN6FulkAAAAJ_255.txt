The analysis is based on a data sample that was recorded in 2010 at a proton-proton center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb^-1. The cross section is measured in a region of high detector acceptance and then extrapolated to the full phase space. The product of the total W production cross section and the W to tau nu branching ratio is measured to be 11.1 +/- 0.3 (stat) +/- 1.7 (syst) +/- 0.4 (lumi) nb."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4308775305389710418,6523242399784354856,18082249640512488797,17683043504902552560,15760863972968734646,8544740153926702747", "cites_id": ["4308775305389710418", "6523242399784354856", "18082249640512488797", "17683043504902552560", "15760863972968734646", "8544740153926702747"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Upy6tk_YyzsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 25, "2013": 16, "2014": 6, "2015": 17, "2016": 12, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 4}}
