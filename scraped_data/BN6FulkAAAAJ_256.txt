This analysis, featuring a search for a sidereal time dependence of the events, is the first test of Lorentz invariance using a reactor-based antineutrino source. No sidereal variation is present in the data and the disappearance results are consistent with sidereal time independent oscillations. Under the Standard-Model Extension, we set the first limits on 14 Lorentz violating coefficients associated with transitions between electron and tau flavor, and set two competitive limits associated with transitions between electron and muon flavor."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:dv5bmdg0oQMC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16518253680047073980", "cites_id": ["16518253680047073980"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.86.112009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vKr-XDSgPOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
