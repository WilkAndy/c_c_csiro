The asymmetry is measured in the W\u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decay mode as a function of the muon pseudorapidity using a data sample corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 31 pb\u2212 1. The results are compared to predictions based on next-to-leading order calculations with various parton distribution functions. This measurement provides information on the u and d quark momentum fractions in the proton.\u00a9 2011 CERN.
