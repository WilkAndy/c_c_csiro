Integral to this process has been the measurement and verification of the tracking performance of the different module types in test beams at the CERN SPS and the KEK PS. Tests have been performed to explore the module performance under various operating conditions including detector bias voltage, magnetic field, incidence angle, and state of irradiation up to 3\u00d71014 protons per square centimetre. A particular emphasis has been the understanding of the operational consequences of the binary readout scheme."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15566911775907877934", "cites_id": ["15566911775907877934"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900204021059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LpTVfMjHCNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 9, "2006": 12, "2007": 14, "2008": 8, "2009": 1, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
