The search uses kinematic criteria to identify \u03bd\u03c4 charged current interactions followed by decay of the \u03c4\u2212 to one of several decay modes. Our \u201cblind\u201d analyses of deep-inelastic scattering data taken in 1996 and 1997, combined with consistent reanalyses of previously reported 1995 data, yield no oscillation signal. For the two-family oscillation scenario, we present the contour outlining a 90% C.L. confidence region in the sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4\u2013\u0394m2 plane. At large \u0394m2, the confidence region includes sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4<1.2\u00d710\u22123 (a limit 3.5 times more stringent than in our previous publication), while at sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4=1, the confidence region includes \u0394m2<1.2 eV2/c4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6331337895546092331,15014314246541295306,796534448925410409", "cites_id": ["6331337895546092331", "15014314246541295306", "796534448925410409"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269399003032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K3v-aEVu3VcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 10, "2000": 29, "2001": 14, "2002": 10, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
