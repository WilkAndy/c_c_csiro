Inclusive and differential jet cross sections in Z events, with Z decaying into electron or muon pairs, are measured for jets with transverse momentum p T> 30 GeV and rapidity| y|< 4. 4. The results are compared to next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, and to predictions from different Monte Carlo generators based on leading-order and next-to-leading-order matrix elements supplemented by parton showers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:b2kfBsK7yCQC", "num_citations": 1165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18024824313339060239,16729968949534369590,12159291689375749554,2887032493070882476,7002439371836982649,18259392417560785635,6874580214615747722,5892643560942527478,2433790402836137767,1971151425299117470", "cites_id": ["18024824313339060239", "16729968949534369590", "12159291689375749554", "2887032493070882476", "7002439371836982649", "18259392417560785635", "6874580214615747722", "5892643560942527478", "2433790402836137767", "1971151425299117470"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP07(2013)032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DyBmnzYKJfoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 124, "2014": 243, "2015": 251, "2016": 119, "2017": 141, "2018": 96, "2019": 56, "2020": 28, "2021": 41, "2022": 43, "2023": 12}}
