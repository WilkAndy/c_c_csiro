Together with its high collision rate, corresponding to an expected integrated luminosity of 10\u2013100 fb\u2212 1/year, these energies will allow for the production of particles with high masses or high transverse momenta or other processes with low production cross-sections. The LHC will search for effects of new interactions at very short distances and for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics (SM).An excellent knowledge of the electron energy and momentum and of the photon energy in a large energy range is needed for precision measurements within and beyond the SM and to resolve possible narrow resonances of new particles over a large background. Therefore good energy resolution and linearity are needed for energies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17046657840636782694", "cites_id": ["17046657840636782694"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/5/11/P11006/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZmjILv3kkewJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 9, "2012": 13, "2013": 19, "2014": 12, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
