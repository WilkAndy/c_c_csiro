Signal detection relies on the identification of \u03bd\u03c4 charged current interactions using kinematic criteria. The analysis of the 1995 data sample yields no oscillation signal. Combining all studied \u03c4 decay modes, a limit of sin 22\u03b8 \u03bc\u03c4< 4.2\u00d710 \u22123 is obtained for large \u0394m2 at the 90% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3427474929339753192", "cites_id": ["3427474929339753192"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269398005218", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6GLa50nWkC8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 19, "2000": 18, "2001": 11, "2002": 8, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
