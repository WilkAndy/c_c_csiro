Events dominated by W\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 production with leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons are selected, and their production cross sections and kinematic properties are measured in several ranges of the photon transverse energy. The results are compared to Standard Model predictions and are used to determine limits on anomalous WW\u03b3 and ZZ\u03b3/Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Ei5r6KrKXVQC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12560522855811524152,14376876775702135619,11520020775840629215", "cites_id": ["12560522855811524152", "14376876775702135619", "11520020775840629215"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312009616", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OCbSJf3wT64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 17, "2013": 23, "2014": 15, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
