Events are selected in two different topologies: single lepton (electron e or muon \u03bc) with large missing transverse energy and at least four jets, and dilepton (ee, \u03bc\u03bc or e\u03bc) with large missing transverse energy and at least two jets. In a data sample of 2.9 pb\u2212 1, 37 candidate events are observed in the single-lepton topology and 9 events in the dilepton topology. The corresponding expected backgrounds from non- Standard Model processes are estimated using data-driven methods and determined to be 12.2\u00b13.9 events and 2.5\u00b10.6 events, respectively. The kinematic properties of the selected events are consistent with SM production.
