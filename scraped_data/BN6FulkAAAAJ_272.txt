The measurement uses the full 2010 data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 39 pb\u22121. Six possible combinations of light, charm and bottom jets are identified in the dijet events, where the jet flavour is defined by the presence of bottom, charm or solely light flavour hadrons in the jet. Kinematic variables, based on the properties of displaced decay vertices and optimised for jet flavour identification, are used in a multidimensional template fit to measure the fractions of these dijet flavour states as functions of the leading jet transverse momentum in the range 40 GeV to 500 GeV and jet rapidity |y|<2.1. The fit results agree with the predictions of leading- and next-to-leading-order calculations, with the exception of the dijet fraction \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:IOTSjrdTKDMC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3985969859448720004,17716720765205039054,3564432639503110137", "cites_id": ["3985969859448720004", "17716720765205039054", "3564432639503110137"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2301-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hMra9XcCUTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 15, "2014": 9, "2015": 13, "2016": 16, "2017": 9, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
