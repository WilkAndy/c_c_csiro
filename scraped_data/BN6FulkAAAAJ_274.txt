The dataset used for this analysis represents an integrated luminosity of 3.1 pb\u22121. Dijet \u03c7 distributions and centrality ratios have been measured up to dijet masses of 2.8 TeV, and found to be in good agreement with Standard Model predictions. Analysis of the \u03c7 distributions excludes quark contact interactions with a compositeness scale \u039b below 3.4 TeV, at 95% confidence level, significantly exceeding previous limits."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8053032878606311927,1416491524224683707", "cites_id": ["8053032878606311927", "1416491524224683707"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269310012190", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9-Hefbwewm8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 30, "2012": 16, "2013": 9, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
