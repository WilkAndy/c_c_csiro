In this paper, we present data from 7.53 days of reactor-off running. Applying the same selection criteria as used in the Double Chooz reactor-on oscillation analysis, a measured background rate of 1.0\u00b10.4 events/day is obtained. The background model for accidentals, cosmogenic \u03b2\u2212 n-emitting isotopes, fast neutrons from cosmic muons, and stopped-\u03bc decays used in the oscillation analysis is demonstrated to be correct within the uncertainties. Kinematic distributions of the events, which are dominantly cosmic-ray-produced correlated-background events, are provided. The background rates are scaled to the shielding depths of two other reactor-based oscillation experiments, Daya Bay and RENO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:IwdsrrWu39oC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17078323655211430792", "cites_id": ["17078323655211430792"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.87.011102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iDMHLOFkAu0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 12, "2014": 16, "2015": 17, "2016": 12, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4}}
