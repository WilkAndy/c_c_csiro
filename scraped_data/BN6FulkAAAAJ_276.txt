A specific benchmark model is considered where all the fermion couplings to the Higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are kept at the Standard Model values (fermiophobic Higgs model). The largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is found at 125.5 GeV, with a local significance of 2.9 standard deviations, which reduces to 1.6 standard deviations when taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. The data exclude the fermiophobic Higgs model in the ranges 110.0\u2013118.0 GeV and 119.5\u2013121.0 GeV at 95 % confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:wuYnf3tzzDUC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18126310811517486473,9016257093393470750,11565892672934341254,17476758921603038300,10425113952741072169,12633286262718578201", "cites_id": ["18126310811517486473", "9016257093393470750", "11565892672934341254", "17476758921603038300", "10425113952741072169", "12633286262718578201"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2157-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iYXSUKWXjfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 18, "2013": 30, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
