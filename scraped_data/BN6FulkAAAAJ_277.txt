The data correspond to 1.44\u00d7106 muon-neutrino Charged Current interactions in the energy range 2.5\u2a7dE\u03bd\u2a7d300 GeV. Neutrino events with only one visible \u03c00 in the final state are expected to result from two Neutral Current processes: coherent \u03c00 production, \u03bd+A\u2192\u03bd+A+\u03c00 and single \u03c00 production in neutrino\u2013nucleon scattering. The signature of coherent \u03c00 production is an emergent \u03c00 almost collinear with the incident neutrino while \u03c00's produced in neutrino\u2013nucleon deep inelastic scattering have larger transverse momenta. In this analysis all relevant backgrounds to the coherent \u03c00 production signal are measured using data themselves.
