The analysis is performed on data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The samples used for this search were collected in 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities in the range 19.5-20.3 fb\u2212 1. The MSSM Higgs bosons are searched for in the \u03c4 \u03c4 final state. No significant excess over the expected background is observed, and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross section times branching fraction of a scalar particle as a function of its mass. The results are also interpreted in the MSSM parameter space for various benchmark scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:W1ZWpF0a3GIC", "num_citations": 1109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13477227718740398409,18024824313339060239,2887032493070882476,452253695403343413,18259392417560785635,3869922889114488122,5892643560942527478", "cites_id": ["13477227718740398409", "18024824313339060239", "2887032493070882476", "452253695403343413", "18259392417560785635", "3869922889114488122", "5892643560942527478"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2014)056", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SdGRbDS7CLsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 80, "2014": 151, "2015": 276, "2016": 192, "2017": 130, "2018": 109, "2019": 63, "2020": 17, "2021": 38, "2022": 33, "2023": 14}}
