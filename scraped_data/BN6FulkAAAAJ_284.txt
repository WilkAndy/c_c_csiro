The new Maia X-ray detector system provides a quantum leap for the method in terms of data acquisition rate. It is now possible to rapidly collect fully quantitative maps of the distribution of major and trace elements at micrometer spatial resolution over areas as large as 1 \u00d7 5 cm2. Fast data acquisition rates also open the way to X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) imaging, in which spectroscopic information is available at each pixel in the map. These capabilities are critical for studying inhomogeneous Earth materials. Using a 96-element prototype Maia detector, we imaged thin sections of an oxidized pisolitic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2325030123086003923", "cites_id": ["2325030123086003923"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/ammin/article-abstract/95/5-6/884/45199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:076fEpQqRCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 13, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
