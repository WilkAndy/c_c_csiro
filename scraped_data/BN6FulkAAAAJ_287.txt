The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in s=7 TeV proton\u2013proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation was observed in 2.05fb\u22121 of data. The results are interpreted in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models with Mmess=250 TeV, N5=3, \u03bc>0, and Cgrav=1. The production of supersymmetric particles is excluded at 95% C.L. up to a supersymmetry breaking scale \u039b=30 TeV, independent of tan\u03b2, and up to \u039b=43 TeV for large tan\u03b2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16272375544856538572,3941204684366787615", "cites_id": ["16272375544856538572", "3941204684366787615"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312007009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zG3t4lcX0-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 33, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
