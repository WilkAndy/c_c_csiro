The mean energy, the energy resolution and the longitudinal and radial shower profiles, and, various observables characterising the shower topology in the calorimeter are measured. The data are compared to Monte Carlo simulations based on a detailed description of the experimental set--up and on various models describing the interaction of particles with matter based on Geant4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8484348818048562138,3252904846665701104", "cites_id": ["8484348818048562138", "3252904846665701104"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/1263861", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2jNKSkx2vnUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 21, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 9, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
