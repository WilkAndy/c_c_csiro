Yields of neutral strange particles ( K 0s ,\u039b, \u039b \u0304 ) have been measured. Mean multiplicities are reported as a function of the event kinematic variables E\u03bd, W2 and Q2 as well as of the variables describing particle behaviour within a hadronic jet: xF, z and pT2. Decays of resonances and heavy hyperons with identified K0s and \u039b in the final state have been analyzed. Clear signals corresponding to K\u2605\u00b1, \u03a3\u2605\u00b1, \u039e\u2212 and \u03a30 have been observed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:adHtZc2wMuEC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=880662658156614082", "cites_id": ["880662658156614082"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321301005843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wlFgigW-OAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 11, "2007": 5, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
