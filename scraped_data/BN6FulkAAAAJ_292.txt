Such a final state may originate from supersymmetric models with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking in events in which one of a pair of higgsino-like neutralinos decays into a photon and a gravitino while the other decays into a Higgs boson and a gravitino. The search is performed using the full dataset of 7 TeV proton\u2013proton collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb\u22121. A total of 7 candidate events are observed while 7.5\u00b12.2 events are expected from the Standard Model background. The results of the search are interpreted in the context of general gauge mediation to exclude certain regions of a benchmark plane for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:5uu-MYFt2EcC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10513095266126139061", "cites_id": ["10513095266126139061"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269313000828", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tQ5Km3EE5pEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 19, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 6}}
