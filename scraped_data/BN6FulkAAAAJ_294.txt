Homeostasis of manganese (Mn), for example, is essential for life. A lack of methods for direct in situ visualization of Mn and other biological metals within intact multicellular eukaryotes limits our understanding of management of these metals. We provide the first quantitative subcellular visualization of endogenous Mn concentrations (spanning two orders of magnitude) associated with individual cells of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8872228999751571245", "cites_id": ["8872228999751571245"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032685", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LZccqER9IHsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
