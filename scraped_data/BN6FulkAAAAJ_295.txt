Twelve events containing two Z boson candidates decaying to electrons and/or muons are observed, with an expected background of 0.3\u00b10.3 (stat)\u2212 0.3+ 0.4 (syst) events. The cross section measured in a phase-space region with good detector acceptance and for dilepton masses within the range 66 to 116 GeV is \u03c3 Z Z\u2192 \u2113+ \u2113\u2212 \u2113+ \u2113\u2212 fid= 19.4\u2212 5.2+ 6.3 (stat)\u2212 0.7+ 0.9 (syst)\u00b10.7 (lumi) fb. The resulting total cross section for on-shell Z Z production, \u03c3 Z Z tot= 8.5\u2212 2.3+ 2.7 (stat)\u2212 0.3+ 0.4 (syst)\u00b10.3 (lumi) pb, is consistent with the standard model expectation of 6.5\u2212 0.2+ 0.3 pb calculated at the next-to-leading order in QCD.
