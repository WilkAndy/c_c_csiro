In addition, jet-like structure in the events is studied by means of azimuthal distributions of charged particles relative to the charged particle with highest transverse momentum in a selected kinematic region of the event. The results are compared with predictions from tunes of the pythia and herwig++ Monte Carlo generators, which in most cases are found to provide a reasonable description of the data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:SgTKrLvt1DcC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3306654015440570738,6367910785015885900,14178647729903835664,4090298213792135237,8580624928736342747,5915942266684446790", "cites_id": ["3306654015440570738", "6367910785015885900", "14178647729903835664", "4090298213792135237", "8580624928736342747", "5915942266684446790"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP07(2012)019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ckl0wU6Y4y0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 0, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
