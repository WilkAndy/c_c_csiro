The search is motivated by an excess of electron-like events in the 200\u2013475 MeV energy region as reported by the MiniBooNE experiment. In NOMAD, photons are identified via their conversion to e+e\u2212 in an active target embedded in a magnetic field. The background to the single photon signal is dominated by the asymmetric decay of neutral pions produced either in a coherent neutrino\u2013nucleus interaction, or in a neutrino\u2013nucleon neutral current deep inelastic scattering, or in an interaction occurring outside the fiducial volume. All three backgrounds are determined in situ using control data samples prior to opening the \u2018signal-box\u2019. In the signal region, we observe 155 events with a predicted background of 129 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17255675114122704293", "cites_id": ["17255675114122704293"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311014286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pfXUgBd5eO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 1, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
