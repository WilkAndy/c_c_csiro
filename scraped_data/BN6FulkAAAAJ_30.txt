The data were recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment in TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, with a total integrated luminosity of 20. 3 fb\u2212 1. Results are interpreted in a variety of simplified and specific supersymmetry-breaking models assuming that R-parity is conserved and that the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. An exclusion limit at the 95% confidence level on the mass of the gluino is set at 1330 GeV for a simplified model incorporating only a gluino and the lightest neutralino. For a simplified model involving the strong production of first-and second-generation squarks, squark masses below 850 GeV (440 GeV) are excluded for a massless lightest neutralino, assuming mass degenerate (single light-flavour \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:YXeC4bxG7-IC", "num_citations": 1082, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6172798260538571545,7619564537585469540,3589591243910227461,17644278616689289912,16004868427200167838,4782149096559349953,15586399767110690321,7247414738570548617,14103427214896041767,13628111923714304277,6556206463796880325", "cites_id": ["6172798260538571545", "7619564537585469540", "3589591243910227461", "17644278616689289912", "16004868427200167838", "4782149096559349953", "15586399767110690321", "7247414738570548617", "14103427214896041767", "13628111923714304277", "6556206463796880325"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2014)176", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GfuMJVAvqlUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 60, "2015": 351, "2016": 241, "2017": 161, "2018": 114, "2019": 41, "2020": 28, "2021": 38, "2022": 27, "2023": 9}}
