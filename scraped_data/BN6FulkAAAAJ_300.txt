Data collected with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of s=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb\u22121, are used. Candidate events with a semileptonic top-quark decay signature are classified as signal- or background-like events by using several kinematic variables as input to a neural network. No signal is observed in the neural network output distribution and a Bayesian upper limit is placed on the production cross-section. The observed upper limit at 95% confidence level on the cross-section multiplied by the t\u2192Wb branching fraction is measured to be \u03c3qg\u2192t\u00d7B(t\u2192Wb)<3.9 pb. This upper limit is converted using a model-independent approach into upper limits on the coupling strengths \u03baugt/\u039b<6.9\u22c510\u22123 TeV\u22121 and \u03bacgt/\u039b<1.6\u22c510\u22122 TeV\u22121, where \u039b is the new physics scale, and on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4901085315290581622", "cites_id": ["4901085315290581622"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312005394", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dkrHjyAnBEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 15, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
