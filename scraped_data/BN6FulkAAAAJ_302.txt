The analysis includes the full 2010 data set, collected with a low rate of multiple proton-proton collisions in the accelerator, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb\u2212 1. Inclusive jet cross sections in Z/\u03b3* events, with Z/\u03b3* decaying into electron or muon pairs, are measured for jets with transverse momentum p T> 30 GeV and jet rapidity| y|< 4.4. The measurements are compared to next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, and to predictions from different Monte Carlo generators implementing leading-order matrix elements supplemented by parton showers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17089804323296462901,4923765085984152314,3674282545625897512", "cites_id": ["17089804323296462901", "4923765085984152314", "3674282545625897512"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.85.032009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NUgFg3wuK-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 12, "2013": 15, "2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
