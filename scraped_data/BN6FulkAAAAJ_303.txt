The analysis uses the data sample collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2010, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 36 pb\u22121. The event selection requires a Z boson decaying into high pT electrons or muons, and at least one b-jet, identified by its displaced vertex, with transverse momentum pT>25 GeV and rapidity |y|<2.1. After subtraction of background processes, the yield is extracted from the vertex mass distribution of the candidate b-jets. The ratio of this cross-section to the inclusive Z cross-section (the average number of b-jets per Z event) is also measured. Both results are found to be in good agreement with perturbative QCD predictions at next-to-leading order."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13102933699530178901,15123274287625342728,1925637505876946196", "cites_id": ["13102933699530178901", "15123274287625342728", "1925637505876946196"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311014389", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VcH9A8f41rUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
