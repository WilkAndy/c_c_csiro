The data sample used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb\u22121. Events with an isolated electron or muon and a \u03c4 lepton decaying hadronically are used. In addition, a large missing transverse momentum and two or more energetic jets are required. At least one of the jets must be identified as originating from a b quark. The measured cross section, \u03c3tt\u00af=186\u00b113(stat.)\u00b120(syst.)\u00b17(lumi.) pb, is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hQUaER0FWQ4C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7337321711338476810,18288137078560397373,13638038731638582165,14792807704304307994,1763147052683671492", "cites_id": ["7337321711338476810", "18288137078560397373", "13638038731638582165", "14792807704304307994", "1763147052683671492"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312009793", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ClUXvzhn02UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 13, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
