We conducted a series of hydrothermal mineral replacement experiments to determine whether a relationship can be established between arsenic (As) distribution in apatite and fluid chemistry. Calcite crystals were reacted with phosphate solutions spiked with As(V), As(III), and mixed As(III)/As(V) species at 250 \u00b0C and water-saturated pressure. Arsenic-bearing apatite rims formed in several hours, and within 48 h the calcite grains were fully replaced. X-ray Absorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) data show that As retained the trivalent oxidation state in the fully-reacted apatite grown from solutions containing only As(III). Extended X-ray Fine Spectroscopy (EXAFS) data reveal that these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:6v-M-8x1n4sC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11847977693788176224", "cites_id": ["11847977693788176224"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703716305385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YP_-cPB4bKQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
