This paper describes the SCT modules of the barrel region, of which more than 2000 are about to be constructed. The module design is fixed. Its design concept is given together with the electrical, thermal and mechanical specifications. The pre-series production of the barrel modules is underway using mass-production procedures and jigs. The pre-series modules have given satisfactory performances on noise, noise occupancy, electrical as well as mechanical and thermal properties. In addition, irradiated modules were demonstrated to work successfully. Also first results from a 10-module system test are given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2755110698588432033", "cites_id": ["2755110698588432033"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900202005284", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oeY9SpUePCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
