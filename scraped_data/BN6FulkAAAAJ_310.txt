The increased data and the use of more refined kinematic schemes for the \u03bd\u03c4 CC selection allow a significant improvement of the overall sensitivity. The \u201cblind analysis\u201d of both the deep-inelastic and the low multiplicity samples yields no evidence for an oscillation signal. In the two-family oscillation scenario, this sets a 90% C.L. region in the sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4\u2212\u0394m2 plane which includes sin 22\u03b8 \u03bc\u03c4< 4.4\u00d710 \u22124 at large \u0394m2 and \u0394m2<0.8 eV2/c4 at sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4=1. The corresponding contour in the \u03bde\u2192\u03bd\u03c4 oscillation hypothesis results in sin 22\u03b8 e\u03c4< 2.2\u00d710 \u22122 at large \u0394m2 and \u0394m2<6.5 eV2/c4 at sin22\u03b8e\u03c4=1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2974029689475391901,17662440509832560205", "cites_id": ["2974029689475391901", "17662440509832560205"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269300006110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nWGl2D7gRSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 15, "2002": 8, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 6, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
