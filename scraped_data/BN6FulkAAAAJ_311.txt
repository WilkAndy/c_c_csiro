The X's would penetrate the downstream shielding and be observed in the NOMAD detector via the Primakoff effect, in the process of X\u2192\u03c00 conversion in the external Coulomb field of a nucleus. With 1.45\u00d71018 protons on target, 20 candidate events with energy between 8 and 140 GeV were found from the analysis of neutrino data. This number is in agreement with the expectation of 18.1\u00b12.8 background events from standard neutrino processes. A new 90 % C.L.  upper limit on the branching ratio Br(\u03c00\u2192\u03b3+X)< (3.3 to 1.9)\u00d710\u22125 for X masses ranging from 0 to 120 MeV/c2 is obtained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12276413464411594903", "cites_id": ["12276413464411594903"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026939800402X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l2ATrgCVXqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
