The search is performed with 2.04 fb-1 of data collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV. One event satisfying the signal selection criteria is observed, which is consistent with the expected background rate. Limits on the product of the WH production cross section and the branching ratio of a Higgs boson decaying to prompt electron-jets are calculated as a function of a Higgs boson mass in the range from 100 GeV to 140 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:aCKekNe3-A4C", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7207181626085315714,2184471238243513091,12602469655223693087", "cites_id": ["7207181626085315714", "2184471238243513091", "12602469655223693087"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4403", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gpSJ7oANBWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 14, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
