This letter explores AMSB scenarios in pp collisions at  by attempting to identify decaying charginos which result in tracks that appear to have few associated hits in the outer region of the tracking system. The search was based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.02 fb\u22121 collected with the ATLAS detector in 2011. The p T spectrum of candidate tracks is found to be consistent with the expectation from Standard Model background processes and constraints on the lifetime and the production cross section were obtained. In the minimal AMSB framework with m 3/2<32 TeV, m 0<1.5 TeV, tan\u03b2=5 and \u03bc>0, a chargino having mass below 92 GeV and a lifetime between 0.5 ns and 2 ns is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:7CU1mCQUTf4C", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11614551854037926029,12633286262718578201,492804673544158166", "cites_id": ["11614551854037926029", "12633286262718578201", "492804673544158166"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-1993-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jQBJ7V8tL6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 11, "2013": 20, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
