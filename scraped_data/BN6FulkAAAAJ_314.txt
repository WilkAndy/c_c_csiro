The data were recorded by the ATLAS detector during 2010 and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u2212 1. No excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. Exclusions at 95% confidence level are placed on two representative models. In an R-parity violating supersymmetric model, tau sneutrinos with a mass below 0.75 TeV are excluded, assuming all R-parity violating couplings are zero except \u03bb 311\u2032= 0.11 and \u03bb 312= 0.07. In a lepton flavor violating model, a Z\u2032-like vector boson with masses of 0.70\u20131.00 TeV and corresponding cross sections times branching ratios of 0.175\u20130.183 pb is excluded. These results extend to higher mass R-parity violating sneutrinos and lepton flavor violating Z\u2019s than previous constraints from the Tevatron."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4536638374673044012,14110605289298475739,8738542531045400745", "cites_id": ["4536638374673044012", "14110605289298475739", "8738542531045400745"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.251801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LNLKzJBg9T4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 17, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
