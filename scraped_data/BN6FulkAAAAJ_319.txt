Quantitative methods permit real-time display of deconvoluted element images and for the acquisition of large area XFM images and 3D datasets for fluorescence tomography and chemical state (XANES) imaging. This paper outlines the Maia system and analytical methods and describes the use of the large detector array, with a wide range of X-ray take-off angles, to provide sensitivity to the depth of features, which is used to provide an imaging depth contrast and to determine the depth of rare precious metal particles in complex geological samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4798007561492945369", "cites_id": ["4798007561492945369"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8851/88510Q/The-Maia-detector-array-and-x-ray-fluorescence-imaging-system/10.1117/12.2027195.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2dlszHTylUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
