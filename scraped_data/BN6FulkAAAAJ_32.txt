The results are based on 2250 W -> lnu and 179 Z/gamma* -> ll candidate events selected from a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 320 nb-1. The measured total W and Z/gamma*-boson production cross sections times the respective leptonic branching ratios for the combined electron and muon channels are $\\stotW$ * BR(W -> lnu) = 9.96 +- 0.23(stat) +- 0.50(syst) +- 1.10(lumi) nb and $\\stotZg$ * BR(Z/gamma* -> ll) = 0.82 +- 0.06(stat) +- 0.05(syst) +- 0.09(lumi) nb (within the invariant mass window 66 < m_ll < 116 GeV). The W/Z cross-section ratio is measured to be 11.7 +- 0.9(stat) +- 0.4(syst). In addition, measurements of the W+ and W- production cross sections and of the lepton charge asymmetry are reported. Theoretical predictions based on NNLO QCD calculations are found to agree with the measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:0BSZZHtHo6cC", "num_citations": 1060, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6014348122950576875,17550476282339635259,12417074948295325656,5997537279167094611,4152089236278671509", "cites_id": ["6014348122950576875", "17550476282339635259", "12417074948295325656", "5997537279167094611", "4152089236278671509"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2130", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:66oBoMBBd1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 24, "2011": 299, "2012": 299, "2013": 159, "2014": 87, "2015": 55, "2016": 50, "2017": 51, "2018": 16, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
