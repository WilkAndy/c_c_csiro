A new project is aimed at harnessing this development to provide high throughput PIXE imaging on the CSIRO Nuclear Microprobe. Maia combines a 1.2sr solid-angle 384 detector array, integrated scanning and real-time processing including spectral deconvolution of full-spectral data. Results using a Maia prototype demonstrate the potential using SXRF application data with elemental images of up 100M pixels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8191937886299143218", "cites_id": ["8191937886299143218"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X10001473", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mrzs1hqcr3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
