Pulse shapes confirmed the peaking time of the amplifier to be 22 ns and deteriorated slightly in the irradiated modules. Median charges saturated around 3.8 fC both in the non-irradiated and irradiated modules. Signal/Noise ratios, using the noises from the in-situ calibration, were > 16 in the non-irradiated (> 150 V), and > 10 in the irradiated (> 300 V) barrel modules. No excess common-mode noise was observed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5485931948198094708", "cites_id": ["5485931948198094708"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1009643/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dGdQigryIUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 7, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
