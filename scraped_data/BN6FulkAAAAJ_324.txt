This channel is particularly sensitive to supersymmetric particle cascade decays producing flavour correlated lepton pairs. Flavour uncorrelated backgrounds are subtracted using a sample of opposite flavour lepton pair events. Observation of an excess beyond Standard Model expectations following this subtraction procedure would offer one of the best routes to measuring the masses of supersymmetric particles. In a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u22121 no such excess is observed. Model-independent limits are set on the contribution to these final states from supersymmetry and are used to exclude regions of a phenomenological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:F7-PPLTuqqMC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4335541663935172874,17721703745274589595", "cites_id": ["4335541663935172874", "17721703745274589595"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1647-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ChHDMyzwKjwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 17, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 1}}
