For the first time the f0(980) meson is observed in neutrino interactions. The statistical significance of its observation is 6 standard deviations. The presence of f2(1270) in neutrino interactions is reliably established. The average multiplicity of these three resonances is measured as a function of several kinematic variables. The experimental results are compared to the multiplicities obtained from a simulation based on the Lund model. In addition, the average multiplicity of \u03c10(770) in antineutrino\u2013nucleus interactions is measured."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:M0j1y4EgrScC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17869870988163106428", "cites_id": ["17869870988163106428"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321301000542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fEaFL_yI_vcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
