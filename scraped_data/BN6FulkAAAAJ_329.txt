However, the ore formation process (syngenetic vs. epigenetic) is still a subject of controversy. In this paper we focus on key characteristics of the HYC deposit that remain unexplained: preservation of sedimentary carbonate (dolomite) and its association with Zn, and the role of thallium (Tl) and manganese (Mn) distribution in the orebody.Our findings demonstrate a sequence of events during ore formation: Tl is hosted almost exclusively within euhedral pyritic overgrowths around early diagenetic pyrite; sphalerite mineralization occurred after Tl-bearing pyrite overgrowths, in association with acid dissolution (replacement) of laminated and nodular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:PRjLZGxZpaIC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17700741191190948859", "cites_id": ["17700741191190948859"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/economicgeology/article-abstract/116/3/693/593408", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-6sPslSqpfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 11}}
