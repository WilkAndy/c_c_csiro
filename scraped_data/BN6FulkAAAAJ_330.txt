Initially, it assumes uniform sample composition, background shape and constant model X-ray relative intensities. A number of image correction methods can be applied in GeoPIXE to correct images to account for chemical concentration gradients, differential absorption effects, and to correct images for pileup effects. A new method, applied in a second pass, uses an end-member phase decomposition obtained from the first pass, and DA matrices determined for each end-member, to re-process the event data with each pixel treated as an admixture of end-member terms. This paper describes the new method and demonstrates through examples and Monte-Carlo simulations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:beqBT5984LEC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5129739906823179289", "cites_id": ["5129739906823179289"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X15007466", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GUxXSER_MEcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
