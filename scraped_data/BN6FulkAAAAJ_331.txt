Data are found to be consistent with the expectation from the Standard Model backgrounds. Limits on R-parity-violating couplings at 95 % C.L. are calculated as a function of the scalar top mass (). The upper limits on the production cross section for pp\u2192e\u03bcX, through the t-channel exchange of a scalar top quark, ranges from 170 fb for  to 30 fb for ."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:wyCGhLAOp5UC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17515316901835648632,5531985691574589383,13246521947227493099", "cites_id": ["17515316901835648632", "5531985691574589383", "13246521947227493099"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2040-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eC5PDuznEvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 12, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
