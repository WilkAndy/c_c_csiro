It targets intermediate spatial scales, with imaging of up to\u223c 80 M pixels over a 500\u00d7 150 mm 2 sample area. It brings together (i) the Maia detector and imaging system, with its large solid-angle, event-mode operation, millisecond pixel transit times in fly-scan mode and real-time spectral deconvolution and imaging,(ii) the high brightness MetalJet D2 liquid metal micro-focus X-ray source from Excillum, and (iii) an efficient XOS polycapillary lens with a flux gain\u223c 15,900 at 21 keV into a\u223c 32 \u03bcm focus, and (iv) a sample scanning stage engineered for standard drill-core sections. Count-rates up to\u223c 3 M/s are observed on drill core samples with low dead-time up to\u223c 1.5%. Automated scans are executed in sequence with display of deconvoluted element \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:8dO9Xi6wxqgC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9696986263935938444", "cites_id": ["9696986263935938444"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/13/03/C03020/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jG--VaGdkoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
