The experimental set-up is based on elements of the CERN West Area Neutrino Facility (WANF) beam line and the NOMAD neutrino detector. The new particles, if they exist, could be produced through the Primakoff effect in interactions of high energy photons, generated by the 450 GeV protons in the CERN SPS neutrino target, with virtual photons from the WANF horn magnetic field. The particles would penetrate the downstream shielding and would be observed in the NOMAD neutrino detector through their re-conversion into real high energy photons by interacting with the virtual photons from the magnetic field of the NOMAD dipole magnet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1867714341345014744", "cites_id": ["1867714341345014744"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269300003750", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2LPFQUx06xkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
