The D\u2605+ yield in \u03bd\u03bc charged current interactions was measured to be T=(0.79\u00b10.17(stat.)\u00b10.10(syst.))%. The mean fraction of the hadronic jet energy taken by the D\u2605+ is 0.67\u00b10.02(stat.)\u00b10.02(syst.). The distributions of the fragmentation variables z, PT2 and xF for D\u2605+ are also presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11330387899702557224", "cites_id": ["11330387899702557224"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269301014939", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KLonicOfPZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
