Theoretical calculations of this process extend to next-to-leading order (NLO)[2\u20134] and next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO)[5\u20139] perturbation theory. Crucial ingredients of the resulting QCD cross section calculations are the parametrizations of the momentum distribution functions of partons in the proton (PDFs). These have been determined recently in a variety of phenomenological analyses to NLO QCD by the CTEQ [10, 11] group and to NNLO by the MSTW [12], ABKM [13, 14], HERAPDF [15, 16], JR [17], and NNPDF [18, 19] groups. The present measurement determines the cross sections times leptonic branching ratios, W\u00c6 \u00c1 BR\u00f0W!\u2018\u00de and Z= \u00c3 \u00c1 BR\u00f0Z= \u00c3!\u2018\u2018\u00de, of inclusive W and Z production for electron and muon final states, where \u2018\u00bc e,. Compared to the initial measurement by the ATLAS Collaboration [20], the data set is enlarged by 100 and the luminosity uncertainty significantly reduced [21] from 11% to 3.4%. The CMS Collaboration has updated their initial measurement of total W and Z cross sections [22] to include data corresponding to an integrated luminosity similar to that used here [23]. Similar measurements have been performed at the p\" p collider Tevatron by the CDF and D0 collaborations [24, 25]. The presented cross section values are integrated over the fiducial region of the analysis and also extrapolated to the full kinematic range. The data are also reported differentially, as functions of the lepton pseudorapidity, 3 l, for the W\u00e6 cross sections, and of the boson rapidity, yZ, for the Z= \u00c3 cross section.
