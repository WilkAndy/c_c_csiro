Lasers of 1060 and 680nm wavelengths were used. A sophisticated method of focusing the laser was developed. Timing and interstrip properties of modules were measured. Analysis of optical effects involved and detailed discussion about the usability of laser testing for particle detectors are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13418859024996296329", "cites_id": ["13418859024996296329"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900206021759", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ieby4y9dOboJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
