A new skip logic controller allows to write at 66 MHz without dead time and to read out at a lower frequency simultaneously. The input circuit is charge-sensitive and integrates continuously. Pedestal nonuniformity is 1.4 mV rms from cell-to-cell and 3.5 mV rms between channels. The linearity range is \u22122.5 to +1.5 V, which corresponds to 11 bits. The chip has been used in a particle detection test."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=261350188969699718", "cites_id": ["261350188969699718"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016890029390339J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:himFt5yAoAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 6, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
