In certain configurations this leads to a measurable EMF. In this paper we report a measurement of the EMF produced by rotationally accelerating coils of aluminium and copper wire. This experiment essentially repeats, using modern instrumentation, the 1916 Tolman-Stewart experiment. The measured EMFs are found to agree with theory to better than 1%."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18122157037874572321", "cites_id": ["18122157037874572321"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/13/12/004/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Iexbhs_VfvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
