The B--> D DsJ (2317) and B--> D DsJ (2460) decays have been observed for the first time. We observe the DsJ (2317) decay to Ds pi0 and DsJ (2460) decay to the Ds* pi0 and Ds gamma final states. We also set the 90% CL upper limits for the decays DsJ (2317)--> Ds* gamma, DsJ (2460)--> Ds* gamma, DsJ (2460)--> Ds pi0 and DsJ (2460)--> Ds pi+ pi-."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:wLxue7F8ec0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3389951552492015028", "cites_id": ["3389951552492015028"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3389951552492015028&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tA0S7PmGCy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
