The detector dark currents can be described by bulk radiation damage models demonstrating the radiation hardness of the detector design and allowing the current damage factor \u03b1 and the acceptor introduction term \u03b2 to be determined. Results from testbeam studies of a module with an irradiated detector and binary readout in a magnetic field and with the beam incident over a range of angles are reported. The hit efficiency and spatial resolution satisfy the requirements for the SCT provided the detector is operated at the full charge collection voltage. The Lorentz angle was not found to be affected by the irradiation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7338258778550754983", "cites_id": ["7338258778550754983"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900200001807", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p95otXq71mUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
