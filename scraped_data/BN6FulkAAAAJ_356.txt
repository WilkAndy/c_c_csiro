The detectors were characterized in laboratory and in beam tests. The inter-strip capacitance showed features in which the individual p-stop structure had the longest tail toward saturation. The beam tests showed other p-stop structures collected more charge in the mid-strip region than the individual p-stop structure. In addition, there was a source which lost or spread charge and induced noise where the over-depletion was insufficient."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=938697508786990713", "cites_id": ["938697508786990713"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/672641/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ee7KKmnsBg0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
