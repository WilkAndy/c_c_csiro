Integral yields of neutral strange particles (Ks0, \u039b, \u039b\u00af) have been measured. Decays of resonances and heavy hyperons with an identified Ks0 or \u039b in the final state have been analyzed. Clear signals corresponding to K\u22c6\u00b1 and \u03a3(1385)\u00b1 have been observed. First results on the measurements of the \u039b polarization in neutral current interactions have been obtained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11189495526611609563", "cites_id": ["11189495526611609563"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321304006984", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2-eBn-USSZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
