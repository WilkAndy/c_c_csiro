Both decays are postulated to occur to explain the time anomaly observed by the KARMEN experiment. From the analysis of the data collected during the 1996\u20131998 runs with 4.1\u00d71019 protons on target, a single candidate event consistent with background expectations was found. The search is sensitive to a pion branching ratio BR(\u03c0\u2192\u03bcX)>3.7\u00d710\u221215, significantly smaller than previous experimental limits."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16514880799738010937", "cites_id": ["16514880799738010937"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269301014861", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OZ1NeJakMOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
