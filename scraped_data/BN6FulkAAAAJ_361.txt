These measurements reflect 800 \u03bc b\u2212 1 of data taken during 2010. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R varying between 0.2 and 1.0. Distributions of the charged-particle multiplicity, the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of charged particles, and the average charged-particle p T are measured as functions of p T jet in regions transverse to and opposite the leading jet for 4 GeV< p T jet< 100 GeV. In addition, the R dependence of the mean values of these observables is studied. In the transverse region, both the multiplicity and the scalar sum of the transverse momentum at fixed p T jet vary significantly with R, while the average charged-particle transverse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7028177329996365149,16307768647806010643,10535249740161921730,8266815787952415900", "cites_id": ["7028177329996365149", "16307768647806010643", "10535249740161921730", "8266815787952415900"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.86.072004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xf3idAsaiWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
