The special background generation procedure was developed. The proton identification criteria are tuned to maximize the sensitivity to the \u0398+ signal as a function of xF which allows to study the \u0398+ production mechanism. We do not observe any evidence for the \u0398+ state in the NOMAD data. We provide an upper limit on \u0398+ production rate at 90% CL as 2.13\u00d710-3 per neutrino interaction.
