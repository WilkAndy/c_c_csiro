The method employs the interference between  and  to extract both the weak and strong phases. We present a study of statistical and systematic errors of this method using Monte Carlo simulation. A fit of the  Dalitz distribution has been performed based on a 140 fb  sample collected by the Belle detector. We observe the indication of a CP asymmetry with the significance of 2.4 standard deviations. The 90% confidence interval obtained for the  value is ."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:GKpE47lcyEAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13412070255494450014", "cites_id": ["13412070255494450014"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13412070255494450014&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XktUUdY-IboJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
