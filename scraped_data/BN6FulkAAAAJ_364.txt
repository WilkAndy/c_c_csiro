It has been exploited for nearly 100 years, yet its origin remains unresolved. In the present study, we characterised eight samples of the reef at four localities in the western Bushveld Complex using micro-X-ray fluorescence and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Our results indicate that the Merensky Reef formed through a range of diverse processes. Textures exhibited by chromite grains at the base of the reef are consistent with supercooling and in situ growth. The local thickening of the Merensky chromitite layers within troughs in the floor rocks is most readily explained by granular flow. Annealing and deformation textures in pyroxenes of the Merensky pegmatoid bear testament to recrystallisation and deformation. The footwall rocks to the reef contain disseminations of PGE rich sulphides as well as olivine grains with peritectic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:9yQbhGFszOQC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15881634109616348376", "cites_id": ["15881634109616348376"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987120302413", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2NxoBBTmZtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
