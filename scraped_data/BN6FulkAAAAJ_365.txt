Of both SCT module geometries\u2014barrel and forward\u2014three identical modules were placed in the beam. One module of each type had been irradiated to 3\u00d71014protons/cm2 in the CERN PS previous to the beam test. A method has been developed to reconstruct the time-resolved shaper pulse from the binary hit information, allowing a more detailed study of the timing properties of the ABCD. The present results will be compared to a simulation of the charge collection and Front End electronics response."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15737903408175507884", "cites_id": ["15737903408175507884"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900202005338", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rOm1ScRDaNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
