Results are presented for test beam measurements of the efficiency and resolution as a function of bias voltage made at the CERN SPS, and for noise measurements giving detector strip quality. The detectors come from four different manufacturers and were made as prototypes for the SemiConductor Tracker of the ATLAS experiment at the CERN LHC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7253512316488995267", "cites_id": ["7253512316488995267"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016890020000259X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w1E_ZgWnqWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
