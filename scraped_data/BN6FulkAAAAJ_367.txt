The detector response to minimum ionizing particles was found to be close to that of non-irradiated detectors. The short integration time of the preamplifier makes the shot noise due to the detector dark current tolerable up to at least 15 \u03bcA/channel."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13631395756365836621", "cites_id": ["13631395756365836621"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016890029391138D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TfHz2jdyLL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1}}
