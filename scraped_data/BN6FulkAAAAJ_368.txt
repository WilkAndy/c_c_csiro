However, Al2O3, CaO, and Na2O contents are markedly lower in the Flatreef, whereas MgO contents are higher. In view of broadly similar silicate mineral compositions in the Flatreef and the WBC reefs, we suggest that the major element compositional differences between the rocks are largely due to higher modal proportions of orthopyroxene and olivine and lower proportions of plagioclase in the Flatreef. The thickness of the mineralised interval is much greater in the Flatreef than in the WBC (several 10 s of m vs ~\u20091 m) and the abundance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:fD-0gpYWMdcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5811347281917022558", "cites_id": ["5811347281917022558"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00126-020-00987-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XpEYJZANplAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
