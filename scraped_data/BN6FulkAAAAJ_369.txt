Spectromicroscopy maps were acquired with spectra for X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) acquisition in the sub-second regime. The method combines XANES measurements with raster-scanning of the sample through the focused beam. The order of the scanning sequence of the axes, one beam energy axis and two (or more) spatial axes, is a variable experimental parameter and, depending on it, the dwell at each location can be either single and continuous (if the energy axis is the inner loop) or in shorter discontinuous intervals (if a spatial axis is innermost). The combination of improved spatial and temporal resolution may be necessary for rapidly changing samples, e.g. for following in\u2005operando chemical reactions or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ESN8wY4Sm6AC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13253230421851525549", "cites_id": ["13253230421851525549"], "pub_url": "https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ig5049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rVHcnNnu7LcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
