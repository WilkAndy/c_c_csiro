Data were collected from runs with beams of different flavour (electrons, pions, muons and photons) with a momentum range of 2 to 180 GeV/c. Four independent methods were used to align the silicon modules. The corrections obtained were validated using the known momenta of the beam particles and were shown to yield consistent results among the different alignment approaches. From the residual distributions, it is concluded that the precision attained in the alignment of the silicon modules is of the order of 5 \u03bcm in their most precise coordinate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13871251552232847565", "cites_id": ["13871251552232847565"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/3/09/P09004/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zbjsMMuVgMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2}}
