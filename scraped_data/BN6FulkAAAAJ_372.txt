In all, 13 fully populated modules constructed from pre-series silicon detectors and ABCD2T readout chips were tested, including examples of both barrel and endcap modules in several variations of hybrid technology. Furthermore, several of the modules were constructed with irradiated silicon detectors and one had been irradiated as a complete module, to a fluence of 3x10^ 14 p/cm^ 2 using 24 GeV/c protons at the CERN PS. Beamtests took the form of threshold scans measuring the response to a 180 GeV pion beam at a variety of incidence angles, magnetic field levels and detector bias voltages. Results of several independent analyses are included, with a description of the common DST and summary ntuple formats now adopted within the SCT beamtest community."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10794290532962449424", "cites_id": ["10794290532962449424"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/684272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ELiWkwwGzZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 1}}
