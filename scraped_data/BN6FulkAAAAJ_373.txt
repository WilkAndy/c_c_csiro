Detector modules with a strip length of 12 cm were made by butting two detectors. One of the 12 cm modules was irradiated with protons to a fluence of 1.2/spl times/10/sup 14/ p/cm/sup 2/, and a beam test was carried out for the non-irradiated and the irradiated detector modules. Efficiency and noise occupancy were analyzed using the beam test data. High efficiency was obtained for both detectors in the bias voltages down to about half the full depletion voltage. The noise occupancy was <2/spl times/10/sup -4/ for the 12 cm strips. The measurement of the edge region exhibited a difference in the sensitivity under the bias resistance where no extension of the n/sup +/-implant was fabricated: the non-irradiated detector showed sensitivity while the irradiated detector did not.
