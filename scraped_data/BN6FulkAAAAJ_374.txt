The main goals of this campaign were to study the detector performance in a controlled environment, to validate the description of the data by the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation and to perform combined studies in a setup close to that of ATLAS (eg studies using the inner tracker with electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry). One of these combined studies focuses on photon reconstruction. In the specific beam setup used for this study, photons were produced via Bremsstrahlung from 180 GeV electrons incident on a thin target upstream of the experimental apparatus. The goal of these runs was to study the reconstruction of converted and unconverted photons with and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5041730951797155484", "cites_id": ["5041730951797155484"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/6/04/P04001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nCb2opbT90UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4}}
