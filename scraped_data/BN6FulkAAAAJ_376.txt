In one dimension the Bose\u2013Einstein effect has been analyzed with the Goldhaber and the Kopylov\u2013Podgoretskii phenomenological parametrizations. The Goldhaber parametrization gives the radius of the pion emission region RG=1.01\u00b10.05(stat)+0.09\u22120.06(sys) fm and for the chaoticity parameter the value \u03bb=0.40\u00b10.03(stat)+0.01\u22120.06(sys). Using the Kopylov\u2013Podgoretskii parametrization yields RKP=2.07\u00b10.04(stat)+0.01\u22120.14(sys) fm and \u03bbKP=0.29\u00b10.06(stat)+0.01\u22120.04(sys). Different parametrizations of the long-range correlations have been also studied. The two-dimensional shape of the source has been investigated in the longitudinal comoving frame.
