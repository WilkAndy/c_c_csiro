The expectation in case of theta(13) = 0 is 8937 events. The deficit is interpreted as evidence of electron antineutrino disappearance. From a rate plus spectral shape analysis we find sin(2)2 theta(13) = 0.109 +/- 0.030(stat) +/- 0.025(syst). The data exclude the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% CL (2.9 sigma)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:chjAzUkeghIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1024099497240103885", "cites_id": ["1024099497240103885"], "pub_url": "https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/24730", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zQunGxFVNg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2}}
