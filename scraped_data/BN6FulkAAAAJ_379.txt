The system can collect fluorescence data in a continuous raster scan mode, and present elemental images in real time using Ryan's Dynamic Analysis algorithm. We will present results from a 32-element prototype array illustrating the concept. The final instrument will have 384 elements arranged in a square array around a central hole."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10047440508482792154", "cites_id": ["10047440508482792154"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4179111/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2qr8qeitb4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
