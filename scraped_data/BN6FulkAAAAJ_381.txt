In all, 16 different modules were tested including 11 pre-production barrel modules, 4\u201d K4\u201d prototype baseline endcap modules, and one\u201d KB\u201d prototype alternative endcap module. Of these, 5 had been previously irradiated with 24 GeV protons at the CERN PS T7 facility to the SCT reference fluence of 3\u00d7 1014p/cm 2. The efficiency, charge collection, spatial resolution and pulse shape were studied as functions of detector bias voltage, incidence angle and magnetic field. In addition, some detailed studies were made of the performance of the modules at the edges of the detectors and at the gaps between the detectors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9697619179158900308", "cites_id": ["9697619179158900308"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/685412/files/indet-2002-024.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VA7IZEPdlIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
