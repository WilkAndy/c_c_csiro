This lab-based instrument combines the Maia parallel energy dispersive (ESD) detector array technology with a focused X-ray beam generated from a liquid metal source. It proves to be a powerful technique for imaging Pt distribution at low-ppm levels on minimally prepared cut rock surfaces over areas of tens to hundreds of square centimeters, an ideal scale for investigating these relationships. Images of a selection of samples from the Bushveld Complex and from the Norilsk-Talnakh ore deposits (Siberia) show strikingly close association of Pt hotspots, equated with the presence of Pt-rich mineral grains, with magmatic sulfide blebs in all cases, except for a taxitic low-S ore sample from Norilsk.
