The data sample, collected in 2011, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.08 and 1.21 fb\u22121 in the e+e\u2212 and \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 channels, respectively. No significant deviations from the standard model are observed. Using a Bayesian approach with a prior flat in 1/\u039b2, the following 95% CL lower limits are placed on the energy scale of \u2113\u2113qq contact interactions: \u039b\u2212>10.1 TeV (\u039b+>9.4 TeV) in the electron channel and \u039b\u2212>8.0 TeV (\u039b+>7.0 TeV) in the muon channel for constructive (destructive) interference in the left\u2013left isoscalar contact interaction model. Limits are also provided for a prior flat in 1/\u039b4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:dgXhHFWAKKUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17377211666074738481,3336722466864215250,4090298213792135237,9950064460782882573", "cites_id": ["17377211666074738481", "3336722466864215250", "4090298213792135237", "9950064460782882573"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312004297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MZ8oH_FBKPEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
