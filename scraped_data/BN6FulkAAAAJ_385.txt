The final state is fully reconstructed using the omega decay into pi^+ pi^-pi^ 0 and detector hermeticity to estimate the neutrino momentum. 155+/-47 signal events are found in the data, corresponding to a branching fraction of (1.3+/-0.4+/-0.2+/-0.3) x 10^-4, where the first two errors are statistical and systematic. The third error is due to the estimated form-factor uncertainty.(This result is preliminary.)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6415947640825130159", "cites_id": ["6415947640825130159"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6415947640825130159&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ryzj3GIGClkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
