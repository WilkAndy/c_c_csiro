A comparison was made between the p-in-n and the n-in-n in high resistivity wafers, and the p-in-n in a low and a high resistivity wafer. The charge collection showed a clear difference in the n-in-n and the p-in-n detectors, which suggested that the signals were shared between strips more in the irradiated p-in-n detectors. Although a difference of the low and the high resistivity wafers was observed in the body capacitance measurement, little difference was observed in the beam test results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13621698216661598032", "cites_id": ["13621698216661598032"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/819262/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UL-vcVv-Cb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
