The detector assemblies (\u201cmodules\u201d) were 12cm long and were read out with binary electronics. Both irradiated and unirradiated modules were measured in a 1.56T magnetic field for efficiency, noise occupancy, and position resolution as a function of bias voltage, binary hit threshold, and detector rotation angle with respect to the beam direction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2874159742070549493", "cites_id": ["2874159742070549493"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900297012692", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9evXtQ4R4ycJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2}}
