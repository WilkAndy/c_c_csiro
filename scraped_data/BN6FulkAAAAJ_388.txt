The data were collected during the H8 beam test at CERN in August/September 1995 and the KEK test in February 1996. The binary modules tested had been assembled from silicon microstrip detectors of different layout and from front-end electronics chips of different architecture. The efficiency, noise occupancy and position resolution were determined as a function of the threshold setting for various bias voltages and angles of incidence for both irradiated and non-irradiated detectors. In particular, the high spatial resolution of the beam telescope allowed the evaluation of the performance as a function of the track location in between detector strips."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14314601877788071377", "cites_id": ["14314601877788071377"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900296011059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0ZWy2pCup8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
