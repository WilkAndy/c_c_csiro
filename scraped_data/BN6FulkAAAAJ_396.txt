This analysis of the lepton+jets final state is specifically designed for the particular topology that arises from the decay of highly boosted top quarks. The observed t\u00aft invariant mass spectrum is found to be compatible with the Standard Model prediction and 95% credibility level upper limits are derived on the t\u00aft production rate through new massive states. An upper limit of 0.7 pb is set on the production cross section times branching fraction of a narrow 1 TeV resonance. A Kaluza-Klein gluon with a mass smaller than 1.5 TeV is excluded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:bUky9QZDauUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11043580883354012316,12694253173079529290", "cites_id": ["11043580883354012316", "12694253173079529290"], "pub_url": "https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/48806", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nEqcUE2uQpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1}}
