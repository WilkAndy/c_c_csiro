The SCT consists of four concentric barrels of silicon detectors as well as two silicon endcap detectors formed by nine disks each. The layout of the forward silicon detector module presented in this paper is based on the approved layout of the silicon detectors of the SCT, their geometry and arrangement in disks, but uses otherwise components identical to the barrel modules of the SCT. The module layout is optimized for excellent thermal management and electrical performance, while keeping the assembly simple and adequate for a large scale module production. This paper summarizes the design and layout of the module and present results of a limited prototype production, which has been extensively tested in the laboratory and testbeam. The module design was not finally adopted for series \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15768842000848522257", "cites_id": ["15768842000848522257"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900204020297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EQzWu0Au1toJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
