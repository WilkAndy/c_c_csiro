The results indicate that all three SCT electronics candidates satisfy ATLAS efficiency and noise occupancy requirements. In addition, a study on the effect of detector bias voltage on efficiency (ballistic deficit) is reported."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3460091263072069377", "cites_id": ["3460091263072069377"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900201006003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AefX4au2BDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 2}}
