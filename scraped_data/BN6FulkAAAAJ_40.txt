The Higgs boson mass ranges 112.9\u2013115.5 GeV, 131\u2013238 GeV and 251\u2013466 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL), while the range 124\u2013519 GeV is expected to be excluded in the absence of a signal. An excess of events is observed around mH\u223c126 GeV with a local significance of 3.5 standard deviations (\u03c3). The local significances of H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3, H\u2192ZZ(\u204e)\u2192\u2113+\u2113\u2212\u2113\u2032+\u2113\u2032\u2212 and H\u2192WW(\u204e)\u2192\u2113+\u03bd\u2113\u2032\u2212\u03bd\u00af, the three most sensitive channels in this mass range, are 2.8\u03c3, 2.1\u03c3 and 1.4\u03c3, respectively. The global probability for the background to produce such a fluctuation anywhere in the explored Higgs boson mass range 110\u2013600 GeV is estimated to be \u223c1.4% or, equivalently, 2.2\u03c3."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 933, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10402969414863816106,5919580879382892233,8160489319720798671,4619484401756583252,17652960269646199359", "cites_id": ["10402969414863816106", "5919580879382892233", "8160489319720798671", "4619484401756583252", "17652960269646199359"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312001852", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qgU2xpDFXpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 479, "2013": 151, "2014": 76, "2015": 60, "2016": 37, "2017": 26, "2018": 24, "2019": 16, "2020": 23, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
