A significant fraction of these investigations are presented elsewhere in this volume and this paper will concentrate on the results with silicon strip detectors read out with electronics preserving the pulse height information. Data has been collected with the ADAM, APV5 and FElix read-out chips on a number of different detectors. The first results are presented for read out with LHC electronics of detectors to the ATLAS-A specification of 112.5 \u03bcm pitch, employing n-strips in n-type silicon, capacitive coupling and intermediate strips. It is demonstrated that with adequate signal/noise, a spatial resolution of \u22cd13 \u03bcm is attainable with these detectors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15271048211468038481", "cites_id": ["15271048211468038481"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900296006699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UbFqWHCp7dMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 1}}
