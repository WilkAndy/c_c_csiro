It achieves this by using a large planar silicon detector array together with event-mode data acquisition, where each detected X-ray event is tagged with position in the scan, thus avoiding the readout overheads of a \u201cstep and acquire\u201d style of mapping. The sample stage moves continuously and the stage encoders are read by the FPGA based real-time processor to provide coordinates for each event, which provides great freedom in scan speed or transit time per map pixel [1]. The large detector array, with 384 independent detector channels, each with its own charge amplification and pulse capture electronics, implemented using custom ASICs, enables cumulative count-rates exceeding 10 M \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:pPOkAXTFjuAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9498969620910830430", "cites_id": ["9498969620910830430"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/maia-detector-journey-development-capabilities-and-applications/B3D9B86661B32F07BF4FB635E8C526DE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XvOd4ooe04MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
