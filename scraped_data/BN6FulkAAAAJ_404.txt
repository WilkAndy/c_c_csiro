C, Particles and fields", "abstract": "English A search for a charged Higgs boson (H+) in [Formula: see text] decays is presented, where one of the top quarks decays via t\u2192 H+ b, followed by H+\u2192 two jets ([Formula: see text]). The other top quark decays to Wb, where the W boson then decays into a lepton (e/\u03bc) and a neutrino. The data were recorded in pp collisions at [Formula: see text] by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2011, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb-1. With no observation of a signal, 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits are set on the decay branching ratio of top quarks to charged Higgs bosons varying between 5% and 1% for H+ masses between 90 GeV and 150 GeV, assuming [Formula: see text]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:1tOlBmfTN3YC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9004766808697962124", "cites_id": ["9004766808697962124"], "pub_url": "https://folia.unifr.ch/global/documents/47353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jH6rBbRb93wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
