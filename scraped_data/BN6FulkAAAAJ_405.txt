Supersymmetry (SUSY)[1\u20139] provides an elegant cancellation of the quadratic mass divergences that would accompany a SM Higgs boson by introducing supersymmetric partners of all SM particles, such as a scalar partner of the top quark (t). Like t\" t, direct tt \u00c3 is produced primarily through gluon fusion at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The production cross section depends mostly on the mass of the top partner and has minimal dependence on other SUSY parameters [10\u201312]. The LHC enables searches for direct tt \u00c3 production at higher mass scales than previous accelerators [13\u201327]. The viability of SUSY as a scenario to stabilize the Higgs potential and to be consistent with electroweak naturalness [28, 29] is tested by the search for tbelow the TeV scale.In this Letter, we present a search for direct tt \u00c3 production assuming t! t 0 1! bW 0 1, where t1 is the lightest t eigenstate and 0 1 represents the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in R-parity conserving models [30\u201334]. We target events where both W bosons decay hadronically, yielding a final state with six high transverse momentum (pT) jets from the all-hadronic t\" t final state and large missing transverse momentum (E miss"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:PxEURkLdyT8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9596842379551018069,10458461444238408848", "cites_id": ["9596842379551018069", "10458461444238408848"], "pub_url": "https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/item/27679/richter-was_et-al_search_for_a_supersymmetric_partner_2012.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VYyNRkzVLoUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
