We reconstruct one neutral B meson as a pi+ pi-CP eigenstate and identify the flavor of the accompanying B meson from its decay products. We find 666+/-43 B0--> pi+ pi-events and perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the distribution of the proper-time differences between the two B meson decays. The fit yields the CP-violating parameters: S_pipi=-0.67+/-0.16 (stat)+/-0.06 (syst) and A_pipi=+ 0.56+/-0.12 (stat)+/-0.06 (syst). Large direct CP-violation is observed with a significance greater than 4 standard deviations for any S_pipi value. Using isospin relations, we obtain 95.4% confidence intervals for the CKM angle phi_2 of 0 deg.< phi_2< 19 deg. and 71 deg.< phi_2< 180 deg."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14888425684548862122", "cites_id": ["14888425684548862122"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14888425684548862122&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qkBWIEdQns4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2}}
