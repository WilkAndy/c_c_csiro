The device was operated at the LHC clock speed of 66 MHz. The different pedestal variations seen at the output are analyzed: the input noise /spl sigma//sub n/ amounts to 2.8mV r.m.s., the pedestal non-uniformity in channel /spl sigma//sub ped/ to 1.2 mV r.m.s., the channel to channel pedestal variation /spl sigma//sub ch/ to 4.0 mV r.m.s., and an output baseline shift /spl sigma//sub obs/ of 3.5 mV r.m.s has been observed.< >"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17147419727781285819", "cites_id": ["17147419727781285819"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/322870/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u8_tOGTf9-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1}}
