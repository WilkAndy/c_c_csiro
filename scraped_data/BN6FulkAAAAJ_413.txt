A suggested second level track trigger for the ATLAS detector is described, based on hit information from a silicon tracker. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to assess the performance of the trigger in accepting electrons and in rejecting the QCD jets that would fake electrons in the first level calorimeter trigger. Studies of the feasibility of implementing such a trigger are also presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9251590057429664378", "cites_id": ["9251590057429664378"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168900293910807", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eoKh5CNAZIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 2}}
