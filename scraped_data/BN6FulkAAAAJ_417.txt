These form one of the planet\u2019s most prospective metallogenic province and a critical source of key metals such as zinc (Zn). As reserves of Zn are steadily depleted, new discoveries must be made in order to ensure security of supply for the future. However, the rate of major new discoveries in the McArthur-Isa province (and others) is critically low, and whilst explorers currently face the reality of having to explore deeper and under cover, innovative approaches to exploration in new frontiers must now be considered.The Mesoproterozoic Edmund Basin in WA, deposited during a time of intraplate rifting and extension following the relaxation of the Capricorn Orogen (Cutten et al., 2016, Johnson, 2013), also contains shale and siltstone units deposited at a similar time to the prospective units in the McArthur and Isa basins (~ 1.6 Ga). One such unit, the Blue Billy Formation, comprises black carbonaceous pyritic shales and siltstones deposited in an intracratonic basin, with underlying and overlying carbonate units, and is locally proximal to several major fault zones. The strongest Zn regolith geochemical anomalies in the Capricorn Orogen terrane, as derived from over 10000 samples from the Geological Survey of Western Australia, occur at surface overlying the Blue Billy Formation. Limited exploration drilling during the 2nd half of the 20th century identified intersections of low-grade stratiform Zn sulfide (sphalerite) mineralization in the black shale facies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:08LKyc9QYe8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3427498841200125244", "cites_id": ["3427498841200125244"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sam-Spinks-2/publication/331198122_Geochemical_and_sedimentological_characterization_of_the_Proterozoic_Blue_Billy_Formation_shale-hosted_Zn-Pb_mineralization_Edmund_Basin_Western_Australia_CSIRO_Mineral_Resources_Discovery_Citation/links/5c6babb792851c1c9deab10f/Geochemical-and-sedimentological-characterization-of-the-Proterozoic-Blue-Billy-Formation-shale-hosted-Zn-Pb-mineralization-Edmund-Basin-Western-Australia-CSIRO-Mineral-Resources-Discovery-Citation.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:POXLUQnskC8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
