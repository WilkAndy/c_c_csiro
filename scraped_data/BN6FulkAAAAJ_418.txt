These events, produced at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at root s = 7 TeV, were recorded by the ATLAS detector. The data sample, collected throughout 2011, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 and 5.0 fb(-1) in the e(+)e(-) and mu(+)mu(-) channels, respectively. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectation are observed. Using a Bayesian approach, 95% confidence level lower limits ranging from 9.0 to 13.9 TeV are placed on the energy scale of llqq contact interactions in the left-left isoscalar model. Lower limits ranging from 2.4 to 3.9 TeV are also set on the string scale in large extra dimension models. After combining these limits with results from a similar search in the diphoton channel, slightly more stringent limits are obtained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ZpfHopiqs50C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6258707901222928946", "cites_id": ["6258707901222928946"], "pub_url": "https://boris.unibe.ch/58404/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MsJSFa1l21YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2}}
