The analysis is performed using an integrated luminosity of 34 pb(-1) recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2010. No deviation from the Standard Model is observed. For a scalar mass of 100 GeV (190 GeV) the limit on the scalar gluon pair production cross section at 95% confidence level is 1 nb (0.28 nb). When these results are interpreted as mass limits, scalar-gluons (hyperpions) with masses of 100 to 185 GeV (100 to 155 GeV) are excluded at 95% confidence level with the exception of a mass window of width about 5 GeV (15 GeV) around 140 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Hmci6z69DXwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7098231831576026608", "cites_id": ["7098231831576026608"], "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/36153", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8J11Jj78gWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
