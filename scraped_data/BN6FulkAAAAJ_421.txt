Bioactive metals affect neuronal function so it is of interest to study whether key trace metal elements are altered in TBI. The recently completed Microspectroscopy Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron enables high definition spatial mapping of trace metal elements using X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). In the current study, XFM has been applied in the fluid percussion model of TBI in rats.The aims of this study were to:(1) map Fe, Cu and Zn within the hippocampus of sham and TBI animals;(2) to determine whether altered distribution of Fe, Cu and Zn can be used to monitor neuronal changes in the hippocampus; and,(3) to assess whether zinc mapping with XFM is a more reliable technique for tracking of the trisynaptic pathway as compared to classical silver \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5158629638361488004", "cites_id": ["5158629638361488004"], "pub_url": "https://www.injuryjournal.com/article/S0020-1383(10)00036-7/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hJpWElMil0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
