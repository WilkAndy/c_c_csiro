The SCEPTER ASIC, originally developed for soft X-ray detection at Brookhaven National Laboratory, has a unique architecture incorporating multiple peak detectors and time-to-amplitude converters, and offers an extremely low dead time, making it ideal for coincidence detection. A representative pair of channels in the prototype system has been characterised. Measured energy and timing resolutions are reported for coincidences between a single-pixel SiPM detector and a conventional PMT. A timing resolution of 11.7 ns was achieved during a 48 hour run. Energy resolution for the SiPM device and data acquisition system was found to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3671855356725570337", "cites_id": ["3671855356725570337"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5401989/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ISs-HP4M9TIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2}}
