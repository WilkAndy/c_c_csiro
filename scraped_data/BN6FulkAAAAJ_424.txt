This system passes now various integration tests. Highlights of the system architecture are presented and details of communication aspects for the high voltage (HV) subsystem are described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4542688645710226266", "cites_id": ["4542688645710226266"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/814095/files/p210.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WiPCTEHfCj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
