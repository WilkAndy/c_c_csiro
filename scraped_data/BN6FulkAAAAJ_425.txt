It consists of four cylindrical layers (barrels) of silicon strip detectors, with nine disks in each of the forward and backward directions. Carbon fibre structures will support a total of 4088 modules, which are the basic functional sub-unit of the SCT. Each module consists of single sided silicon micro-strip detectors glued back to back with a 40 mrad stereo-angle, and attached to a hybrid. The scope of this document is to present the electrical performances of prototype end-cap modules proposed for the ATLAS-SCT, as an alternative to the baseline. The layout of these modules is based on the implementation of the barrel module hybrid in the end-cap geometry. A complete set of electrical measurements is summarized in this paper, including irradiated module tests and beam tests."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14180992015123293191", "cites_id": ["14180992015123293191"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/685498", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ByQTiBoBzcQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
