ATLAS simulations, on the other hand, predict the efficiency and fake rates for the complete inner detector in a realistic environment. In the H8 test beam in August 2002 an attempt was made to bridge the gap between simulation and measurement. To this end tracks were reconstructed using only the information from an array of prototype SCT modules. In this note the most important results are presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3700554366234537935", "cites_id": ["3700554366234537935"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/685484", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zy9u95YCWzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
