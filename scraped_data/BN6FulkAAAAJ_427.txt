Binary readout method is used so many threshold scans at a variety of incidence angles, magnetic field levels and detector bias voltages were taken. Results of analysis showing module efficiencies, noise occupancies, spatial resolution and median charge are presented. Several modules have been built using detectors irradiated to the full ATLAS dose of 3\u00d7 1014 p/cm2 and one module was irradiated as a complete module. Effects of irradiation on the detector and ASIC performance is shown."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17903103767759131072", "cites_id": ["17903103767759131072"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25325964.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wJE9pgWadPgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
