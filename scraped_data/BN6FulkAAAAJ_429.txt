Baseline detector assemblies (\u201cmodules\u201d) of 12 cm length were read out with binary electronics at 40 MHz clock speed. For both irradiated and unirradiated modules, the tracking efficiency, noise occupancy, and position resolution were measured as a function of bias voltage, binary hit threshold, and detector rotation angle in a 1.56 T magnetic field. Measurements were also performed at a particle flux comparable to the one expected at the LHC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5536923551070854802", "cites_id": ["5536923551070854802"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900297011029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kp4SQqIa10wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
