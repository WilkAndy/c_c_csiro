The detector assemblies were 12 cm long and were read out with binary electronics. Both irradiated and unirradiated assemblies were measured in a 1.56T magnetic field for efficiency, noise occupancy, and resolution as a function of bias voltage, binary hit threshold, and detector rotation angle with respect to the beam direction. Measurements were also performed at a particle flux comparable to the one expected at the LHC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12182846646553836106", "cites_id": ["12182846646553836106"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/512965", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SnrmQHoqEqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1}}
