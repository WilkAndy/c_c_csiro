Maia uses an annular array of 384 silicon detectors to provide a solid-angle of 1.3\u202fsr to improve the collection of X-rays induced by Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) using a micron focussed MeV proton beam. It features event-by-event data acquisition with dead-time correction and pileup rejection and a total count-rate capacity above 10\u202fM/s, versatile stage and beam scanning modes (coupled to the DAQ-36 system described previously) to cater for a variety of sample configuration and experimental needs, precise measurement of transit time and integration of beam fluence per pixel, and spectral deconvolution of event data in real-time using the Dynamic Analysis method to provide element images during data collection. Here we demonstrate the system on thin sections made from geological samples \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:HG5mk1ZgfbgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9326145348651674356", "cites_id": ["9326145348651674356"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X19302162", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9GoLVsgfbYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
