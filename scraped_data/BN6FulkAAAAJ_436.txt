It uses focused X-rays from a laboratory micro-focus source and builds on the success of the Maia detector array in geology [1] to achieve imaging of up to~ 80 M pixels over a 500\u00d7 150 mm2 sample area, as part of the analytical workflow of the Advanced Resource Characterization Facility, which spans spatial scales from ore deposit to atomic scales.Maia Mapper combines (see Fig. 1)(i) the Maia detector array and fluorescence imaging system [2, 3], with its large solid-angle (1.3 sr) and high count-rate capacity (> 10 M/s), event-mode operation, millisecond \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:YOrU8YsttWoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2541852866857491498", "cites_id": ["2541852866857491498"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/maia-mapper-high-definition-xrf-imaging-of-geological-samples-at-intermediate-spatial-scales/AC9796841EC0D8DB9CC9D6AB7E2E87E1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KlxZELd5RiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
