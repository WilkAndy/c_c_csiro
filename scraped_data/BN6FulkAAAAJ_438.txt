Selection of [Formula: see text](1020) mesons is based on the identification of charged kaons by their energy loss in the pixel detector. The differential cross section is measured as a function of the transverse momentum, [Formula: see text], and rapidity, [Formula: see text], of the [Formula: see text](1020) meson in the fiducial region 500 [Formula: see text] 1200 MeV, [Formula: see text] 0.8, kaon [Formula: see text] 230 MeV and kaon momentum [Formula: see text] 800 MeV. The integrated [Formula: see text]-meson production cross section in this fiducial range is measured to be [Formula: see text] = 570 [Formula: see text] 8 (stat) [Formula: see text] 66 (syst) [Formula: see text] 20 (lumi) [Formula: see text]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:W6lDjji-Y3sC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18240366348375748167", "cites_id": ["18240366348375748167"], "pub_url": "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/40f0271g", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R-7sX43MIv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
