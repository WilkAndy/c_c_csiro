Since the couplings of the light quarks are well constrained, if VLQs exist they are generally expected to only couple sizably to the third generation. However, in certain scenarios, corrections to quark mixings can cancel, relaxing these constraints. The motivation and phenomenology of heavy VLQs coupling to light generations is discussed for the Tevatron [11], where a baseline model is introduced which considers two degenerate VLQ doublets having hypercharges 1/6 and 7/6 and mixing only with the up quark. This scenario can occur naturally in certain models [12]. Because the doublets are degenerate, cancellations occur which allow VLQ coupling to the first two generations, leading to a potentially strong signal at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Following the notation of more recent work [13] which describes a model-independent approach to VLQ sensitivity at the LHC, a coupling \u03baqQ=(v/mQ) \u03baqQ is defined here, where q stands for any light quark, Q is the VLQ, mQ is the VLQ mass, v is the Higgs vacuum expectation value and \u03baqQ encodes all the model dependence of the qV Q vertex (V= W or Z). Electroweak precision measurements constrain the contribution of heavy quarks to loop diagrams, but under certain conditions, as for the degenerate"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:5o6HiIVP414C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16732128249215837184,13884483532473082311,12078990161153570596,9875895926530435680,5915942266684446790", "cites_id": ["16732128249215837184", "13884483532473082311", "12078990161153570596", "9875895926530435680", "5915942266684446790"], "pub_url": "https://air.unimi.it/retrieve/handle/2434/203996/746674/1-s2.0-S0370269312003802-main.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AOTJ9v11NOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
