This is due to energy lost in hadronic showers in forms not measurable as an ionization signal, ie, nuclear break-up, spallation and excitation, energy deposits arriving out of the sensitive time window (such as delayed photons), soft neutrons, and particles escaping the detector [1\u20133]. Moreover, the calorimeter response will be non-linear, since a hadronic shower has both an electromagnetic and a hadronic component, with the size of the former increasing with shower energy [4]. In addition, the large phase space of hadronic interactions leads to substantial fluctuations in the size of the electromagnetic shower component from event to event, degrading the measured energy resolution.
