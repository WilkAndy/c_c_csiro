This beam was used at the ATLAS H8 testbeam facility to measure on non-irradiated and irradiated SCT prototype modules effects related to the detailed timing of the readout. Four additional SCT modules were arranged to form a binary telescope, allowing high readout rates, relatively high beam intensities and providing a time stamp for reconstructed tracks of reasonable spatial resolution. We report the most important results in this note."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1650510508169017488", "cites_id": ["1650510508169017488"], "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/685413", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kLh2-Y_K5xYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1}}
