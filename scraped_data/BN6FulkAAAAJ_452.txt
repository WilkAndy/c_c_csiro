Detailed analyses of the momentum distributions, of the production rates, and of the general features of events with a backward going particle, have been carried out in order to understand the mechanism producing these particles. The backward proton data have been compared with the predictions of the reinteraction and the short range correlation models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2898299115125996108,13658431162006836780", "cites_id": ["2898299115125996108", "13658431162006836780"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321301002930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TPrpebDTOCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
