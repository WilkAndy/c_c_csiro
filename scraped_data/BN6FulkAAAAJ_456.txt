The annual maintenance effort is estimated to be As in the software industry where computer aided software around 15% of the development effort and exceeds the engineering (CASE) methodologies and tools are commonly production capacity of the groups in charge. Here, maintenance used, CERN endeavours to introduce this technology to is defined as software repair and update resulting from a improve the efficiency of designing, producing and changed functional specification of the software product. For maintaining software. A large project is currently under each new development the volume of the software increases development in the administrative area whereas a dedicated because more sophistication is required. By the time die LHC group has been set up to evaluate state of the art techniques for is approved, the demand for application software may well be software development relating to physics experiments. A two to three limes higher because of increased functionality, similar activity, though on a smaller scale, has been initialed increased information volume, more severe execution time in the accelerator sector also in view of the large amount of constraints due to the superconducting nature of the machine, software that will be required by the LEP20O and the LHC and higher reliability [3]. Even if die groups in charge manage projects. This paper briefly describes this technology and gives to develop such large paclcages with the help of professional, an account of current experience with the use of CASE voluntary and temporary staff, they will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14531618489472929708", "cites_id": ["14531618489472929708"], "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:25047470", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rE-IPAauqskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1}}
