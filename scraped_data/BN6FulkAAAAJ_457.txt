Use of a binary telescope made up of SCT modules allowed for high readout rates and provided a time stamp for the reconstructed tracks. This note reports on the most important results from a series of tests performed on SCT modules during that period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9199324406452721340", "cites_id": ["9199324406452721340"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9199324406452721340&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vBYyvM6Qqn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
