Grains can be a major source of micronutrients such as iron; however, only 5-25% of the total Fe in wheat is bioavailable for absorption by humans [3], likely due to chelation by phytates [4]. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopic imaging can identify the iron species, and thenceforth the processes that can affect the elemental bioavailability. Radiation damage due to exposure to ionizing radiation is a limiting factor in X-ray analysis of samples [5]. It is well known that cryogenic temperatures greatly reduce such damage [6]; however, such measurements can be logistically challenging to perform. STXM XANES has previously been used at room temperature to measure radiation-induced chemical changes to a uniform polymer film sample (PMMA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:eneGHNKr9GoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/microscopy-and-microanalysis/article/utilization-of-xanes-imaging-in-assessing-radiation-damage-in-wheat/0AEE4963E5790C066AD00F0521C0E28E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MO9xx81GAAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
