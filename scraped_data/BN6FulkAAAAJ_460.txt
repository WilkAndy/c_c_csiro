My personal view has always been that our knowledge and understanding of biology and human physiology have developed in parallel with our capacity to image cells and tissues as well as organs and body structures. These include advanced imaging modalities from microscopy for imaging of cells and tissues through to 2D and 3D macroscopic techniques for imaging of tissues and organs. Medical diagnoses, monitoring of disease progression, efficacy of therapies and the recent advent of \u2018targeted imaging\u2019rely upon techniques such as X-ray analysis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and more.
