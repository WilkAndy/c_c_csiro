The search is based on pp collision data taken at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb\u22121. Three high-transverse-momentum electrons or muons are selected, with two of them required to be consistent with originating from a Z boson decay. No significant excess above Standard Model background predictions is observed, and 95% confidence level limits on the production cross section of high-mass trilepton resonances are derived. The results are interpreted in the context of vector-like lepton and type-III seesaw models. For the vector-like lepton model, most heavy lepton mass values in the range 114\u2013176 GeV are excluded. For the type-III seesaw model, most mass values in the range 100\u2013468 GeV are excluded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:7uOkfv6XYJ4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://openaccess.dogus.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11376/2484", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7i9g_BpKcIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
