The data were produced in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions by the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 315 nb(-1) collected by the ATLAS detector. No resonances were observed. Upper limits were set on the product of cross section and signal acceptance for excited-quark (q*) production as a function of q* mass. These exclude at the 95% C. L. the q* mass interval 0: 30< m(q)*< 1:26 TeV, extending the reach of previous experiments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:iNqUzk5Q83YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=709066755924140861&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
