The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb\u22121. No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed; 95% credibility upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction of Z' resonances decaying into \u03c4 +\u03c4 \u2212 pairs as a function of the resonance mass. As a result, Z' bosons of the Sequential Standard Model with masses less than 1.40 TeV are excluded at 95% credibility."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:LA4OTcbMHDQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/77560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a8UZAhjR5ygJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
