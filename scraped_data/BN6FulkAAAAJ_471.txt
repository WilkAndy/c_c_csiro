The analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data were recorded in 2011 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb\u22121 to 4.8 fb\u22121. Higgs boson decays into oppositely-charged muon or \u03c4 lepton pairs are considered for final states requiring either the presence or absence of b-jets. No statistically significant excess over the expected background is observed and exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are derived. The exclusion limits are for the production cross-section of a generic neutral Higgs boson, \u03d5, as a function of the Higgs boson mass and for h/A/H production in the MSSM as a function of the parameters mA and tan \u03b2 in the   mmaxh  scenario for mA in the range of 90 GeV to 500 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:pv_KVKnV4GcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/78255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2j-UhJj3nuUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
