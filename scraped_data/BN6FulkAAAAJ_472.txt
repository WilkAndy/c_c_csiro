A data sample of 2.05 fb\u22121 recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is used. Relative differential cross-sections are derived as a function of the invariant mass, the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the top quark pair system. Events are selected in the lepton (electron or muon) + jets channel. The background-subtracted differential distributions are corrected for detector effects, normalized to the total inclusive top quark pair production cross-section and compared to theoretical predictions. The measurement uncertainties range typically between 10 % and 20 % and are generally dominated by systematic effects. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:hXkWDDAEazwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/11786", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xRpbIx2nk-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
