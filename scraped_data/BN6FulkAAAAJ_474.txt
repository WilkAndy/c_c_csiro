The other top quark decays to Wb, where the W boson then decays into a lepton (e/\u03bc) and a neutrino. The data were recorded in pp collisions at \u221as = 7 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2011, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb\u22121. With no observation of a signal, 95 % confidence level (CL) upper limits are set on the decay branching ratio of top quarks to charged Higgs bosons varying between 5 % and 1 % for H+ masses between 90 GeV and 150 GeV, assuming B(H+ \u2192 c[bar over s]) = 100 %."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:au4Xmb-e4ZIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105730", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XrseoQleFQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
