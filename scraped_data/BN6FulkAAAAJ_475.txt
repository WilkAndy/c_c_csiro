The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u2212 1 . No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed; 95% credibility upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction of Z resonances decaying into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pairsasafunctionofthe resonance mass. As a result, Z bosons of the Sequential Standard Model with masses less than 1.40 TeV are excluded at 95% credibility"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:rPCM0R7QKh4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/142503", "cites_per_year": {}}
