The analysis is based on proton\u2013proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.67 fb\u22121. The cross section is measured to be  \u03c3t[bar over t]=194\u00b118 (stat.)\u00b146 (syst.) pb and is in agreement with other measurements and with the Standard Model prediction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:JgaSC4GK3rcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/105491", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t7PoHWP8-OUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
