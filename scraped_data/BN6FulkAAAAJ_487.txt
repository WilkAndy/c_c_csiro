These results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb (-1), collected with the ATLAS detector. Cross-sections are presented as a function of jet multiplicity and of the transverse momentum of the leading b-jet for both the muon and electron decay modes of the W boson. The W+ b-jets cross-section, corrected for all known detector effects, is quoted in a limited kinematic range. Combining the muon and electron channels, the fiducial cross-section for W+ b-jets is measured to be 7.1+/-0.5 (stat)+/-1.4 (syst) pb, consistent with the next-to-leading order QCD prediction, corrected for non-perturbative and double-parton interactions (DPI) contributions, of 4.70+/-0.09 (stat)(+ 0.60)(-0.49)(scale)+/-0.06 (PDF)+/-0.16 (non-pert)(+ 0.52)(-0.38)(DPI) pb."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ipSP0SfFaZ8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:645493", "cites_per_year": {}}
