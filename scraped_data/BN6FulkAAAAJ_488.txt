The data were recorded with the ATLAS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb(-1). Each leptoquark is assumed to decay to a tau lepton and a b-quark with a branching fraction equal to 100%. No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. Third generation leptoquarks are therefore excluded at 95% confidence level for masses less than 534 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:0dtNEdnCFDAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://boris.unibe.ch/58446/1/1303.0526.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NYkrS_kxBYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
