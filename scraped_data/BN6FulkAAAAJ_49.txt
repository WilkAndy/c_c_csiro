In a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb\u2212 1 collected in 2011, events are selected that are consistent either with two Z bosons decaying to electrons or muons or with one Z boson decaying to electrons or muons and a second Z boson decaying to neutrinos. The ZZ (*)\u2192 \u2113+ \u2113\u2212 \u2113\u2032+ \u2113\u2032\u2212 and cross sections are measured in restricted phase-space regions. These results are then used to derive the total cross section for ZZ events produced with both Z bosons in the mass range 66 to 116 GeV,\\(\\sigma_ {ZZ}^{\\mathrm {tot}}= 6.7\\pm 0.7\\;\\,\\left ({\\mathrm {stat}.}\\right)\\;\\; _ {-0.3}^{+ 0.4}\\;\\,\\left ({\\mathrm {syst}.}\\right)\\pm 0.3\\;\\,\\left ({\\mathrm {lumi}.}\\right)\\) pb, which is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:o4Qvs5Y5TLQC", "num_citations": 839, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16729968949534369590,7237475093745629783,2887032493070882476,18259392417560785635,10136561262786706659,10342963206847792089,5892643560942527478", "cites_id": ["16729968949534369590", "7237475093745629783", "2887032493070882476", "18259392417560785635", "10136561262786706659", "10342963206847792089", "5892643560942527478"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03(2013)128", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NqdP1B7KLOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 69, "2014": 178, "2015": 202, "2016": 110, "2017": 87, "2018": 56, "2019": 42, "2020": 16, "2021": 31, "2022": 29, "2023": 11}}
