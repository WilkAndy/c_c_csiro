The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12 fb(-1) of root s = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass (m(gamma gamma)) spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used. The results also set 95% CL lower limits on the lightest Randall-Sundrum graviton mass of between 0.79 and 1.85 TeV, for values of the dimensionless coupling k/(M) over bar (Pl) varying from 0.01 to 0.1. Combining with previously published ATLAS results from the dielectron and dimuon final states, the 95% CL lower limit on the Randall-Sundrum graviton mass for k/(M) over bar (Pl) = 0.01 (0.1) is 0.80 (1.95) TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:LpJ4L8tw5K0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://openaccess.dogus.edu.tr/xmlui/handle/11376/1619", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OLsdpxp9DHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
