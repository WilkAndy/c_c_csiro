Data collected in 2010 at $\\sqrt{s}=7\\mbox{~TeV}$ are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of almost 40 pb\u22121. The inter-alignment of the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter, the determination of the electron energy scale and resolution, and the performance in terms of response uniformity and linearity are discussed. The electron identification, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies, as well as the charge misidentification probability, are also presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 4215, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1762831469858059875,167936270480486957,16912577831440217489,1783753979756688926,9016257093393470750,5462106228585281147", "cites_id": ["1762831469858059875", "167936270480486957", "16912577831440217489", "1783753979756688926", "9016257093393470750", "5462106228585281147"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-1909-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y_bEx-HVdhgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 38, "2012": 540, "2013": 476, "2014": 413, "2015": 356, "2016": 473, "2017": 621, "2018": 669, "2019": 350, "2020": 123, "2021": 84, "2022": 52, "2023": 12}}
