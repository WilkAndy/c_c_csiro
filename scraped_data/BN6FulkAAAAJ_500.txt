The muon cross-section is measured as a function of pTpT in the range 4<pT<100 GeV4<pT<100 GeV and within pseudorapidity |\u03b7|<2.5|\u03b7|<2.5. In addition the electron and muon cross-sections are measured in the range 7<pT<26 GeV and within |\u03b7|<2.0|\u03b7|<2.0, excluding 1.37<|\u03b7|<1.521.37<|\u03b7|<1.52.  Integrated luminosities of 1.3 pb -1 and 1.4 pb -1 are used for the electron and muon measurements, respectively. After subtraction of the W/Z/y* contribution, the differential cross-sections are found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions for heavy-flavour production obtained from Fixed Order NLO calculations with NLL high-pT resummation, and to be sensitive to the effects of NLL resummation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:oZ0G5Krk7UoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/91992", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CQ-QxulemO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
