It is measured from the energies of the decay products in hadronic \u03c4 decays with a single final state charged particle. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 24 pb\u22121, were collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2010. The measured value of the \u03c4 polarization is \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}\\end{document}, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction, and is consistent with a physically allowed 95 % CL interval [\u22121,\u22120.91].
