Results are presented based on the analysis of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb(-1). No evidence for excited leptons is found, and limits are set on the compositeness scale Lambda as a function of the excited lepton mass m(l*). In the special case where Lambda = m(l*), excited electron and muon masses below 1.87 TeV and 1.75 TeV are excluded at 95% C.L., respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:X-kyIj4Jmq4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/36747", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ut7IT1FxUDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
