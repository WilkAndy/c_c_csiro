It is measured from the energies of the decay products in hadronic tau decays with a single final state charged particle. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 24 pb^-1, were collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2010. The measured value of the tau polarization is Ptau=-1.06+/-0.04 (stat)+ 0.05 (syst)-0.07 (syst), in agreement with the Standard Model prediction, and is consistent with a physically allowed 95% CL interval [-1,-0.91]. Measurements of tau polarization have not previously been made at hadron colliders."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:6hyyh8_BpA4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/measurement-of-tau-polarization-in-w-taunu-decays-with-the-atlas-", "cites_per_year": {}}
