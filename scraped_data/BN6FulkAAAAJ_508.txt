The search is performed with 1.04 fb(-1) of integrated luminosity from pp collisions at root s = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. Dilepton final states are selected, requiring large missing transverse momentum and at least two jets. Mass reconstruction of heavy-quark candidates is performed by assuming that the W boson decay products are nearly collinear. The data are in agreement with standard model expectations; a heavy quark with mass less than 350 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:HnLqbUOjpDMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/36748", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sLJGpZxkWNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
