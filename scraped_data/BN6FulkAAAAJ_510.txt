No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed and a 95% CL upper limit on the visible cross section for new phenomena is set, where the visible cross section is defined by the product of cross section, branching fraction, detector acceptance and event selection efficiency. A 95% CL lower limit of 32 TeV is set on the gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) scale Lambda independent of tan beta. These limits provide the most stringent tests to date in a large part of the considered parameter space."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:yP4e4_ytxyQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:576881", "cites_per_year": {}}
