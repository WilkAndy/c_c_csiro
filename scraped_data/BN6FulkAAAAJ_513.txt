However, some extensions to the SM predict additional mechanisms for resonant ZZ production. For example, models of warped extra dimensions [1, 2] predict two such resonances: excited states of the spin-2 graviton (G\u2217) and the spin-0 radion (R). Searches for such gravitons by the ATLAS Collaboration have excluded at 95% confidence level masses smaller than 1.63 TeV in dilepton final states [3] and smaller than 1.9 TeV in diphoton final states [4]; CMS has excluded masses below 1.84 TeV in diphoton final states [5]. Recent versions of these models [6] in which all SM fields propagate in these new dimensions predict enhanced coupling of the graviton to the ZZ final state and suppressed decay rates to light fermion and diphoton states. Observation of graviton production and decay to a pair of Z bosons would be striking evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. This Letter describes the search for a new particle decaying to the ZZ final state using the RS1 excited graviton (G\u2217) as a benchmark model [1]. This search uses 1. 02 fb\u2212 1 of integrated luminosity collected between February and June 2011 by the ATLAS detector in"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:vR9F06f0vR0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/216161163.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9lUmxri0IusJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
