The analysis is carried out in four distinct signal regions with either three or four jets and variations on the (missing) transverse momentum cuts, resulting in optimized limits for various supersymmetry models. No excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. Limits are set on the visible cross section of new physics within the kinematic requirements of the search. The results are interpreted as limits on the parameters of the minimal supergravity framework, limits on cross sections of simplified models with specific squark and gluino decay modes, and limits on parameters of a model with bilinear R-parity violation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Ov8rX5H-XoQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://boris.unibe.ch/18122/1/PhysRevD.85.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qjeJR86PkpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
