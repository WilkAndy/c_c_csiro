The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb\u22121, which was recorded in 2011 at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. No evidence for a resonance is found and limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio to  t[bar over t] for narrow and wide resonances. For narrow Z\u2032 bosons, the observed 95 % Bayesian credibility level limits range from 9.3 pb to 0.95 pb for masses in the range of mZ\u2032=500 GeV to mZ\u2032=1300 GeV. The corresponding excluded mass region for a leptophobic topcolour Z\u2032 boson (Kaluza-Klein gluon excitation in the Randall-Sundrum model) is mZ\u2032<880 GeV (mgKK<1130 GeV mgKK<1130 GeV)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Said4mMTsmcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/106149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S1v_ET8_vm8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
