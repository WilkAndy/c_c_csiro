The event selection requires missing transverse momentum, no isolated electrons or muons, and from >= 6 to >= 9 jets. No evidence is found for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in the context of a MSUGRA/CMSSM supersymmetric model, where, for large universal scalar mass m(0), gluino masses smaller than 840 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level, extending previously published limits. Within a simplified model containing only a gluino octet and a neutralino, gluino masses smaller than 870 GeV are similarly excluded for neutralino masses below 100 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:3ssty3PwuTgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/37465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JDf_6I0xoacJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
