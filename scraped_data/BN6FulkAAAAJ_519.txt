A total of 16 (4) events are observed compared to a predicted standard model background of 13.5(-3.6)(+3.7) (4.4(-1.3)(+1.7)) events in two signal regions based on integral Ldt = 4.7 fb(-1) of pp collision data taken at root s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. An exclusion region in the (t) over tilde (1) versus (chi) over tilde (0)(1) mass plane is evaluated: 370 < m(<(t)over tilde>1) < 465 GeV is excluded for m(<(chi)over tilde>10) similar to 0 GeV while m((t) over tilde1) = 445 GeV is excluded for m((chi) over tilde 10) <= 50 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:2hrGa7H818QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/36196", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e-THAuGZQN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
