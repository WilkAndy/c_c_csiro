The results are based on an integrated luminosity of approximately 7 \u03bcb\u22121. Elliptic flow is measured over a wide region in pseudorapidity, |\u03b7|<2.5, and over a broad range in transverse momentum, 0.5<pT<20 GeV. The elliptic flow parameter v2 is obtained by correlating individual tracks with the event plane measured using energy deposited in the forward calorimeters. As a function of transverse momentum, v2(pT) reaches a maximum at pT of about 3 GeV, then decreases and becomes weakly dependent on pT above 7\u20138 GeV. Over the measured pseudorapidity region, v2 is found to be only weakly dependent on \u03b7, with less variation than observed at lower beam energies. The results are discussed in the context of previous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 790, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8161419268094180087,431379868423623389", "cites_id": ["8161419268094180087", "431379868423623389"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311015243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9zrIUZUvQ3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 53, "2013": 100, "2014": 96, "2015": 85, "2016": 88, "2017": 79, "2018": 49, "2019": 64, "2020": 51, "2021": 51, "2022": 35, "2023": 23}}
