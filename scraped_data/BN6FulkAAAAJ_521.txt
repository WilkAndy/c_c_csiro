The cross sections are reported integrated over a fiducial kinematic range, extrapolated to the full range, and also evaluated differentially as a function of the W decay lepton pseudorapidity and the Z boson rapidity, respectively. Based on an integrated luminosity of about 35 pb(-1) collected in 2010, the precision of these measurements reaches a few percent. The integrated and the differential W-+/- and Z/gamma* cross sections in the e and mu channels are combined, and compared with perturbative QCD calculations, based on a number of different parton distribution sets available at next-to-next-to-leading order."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:kVKjLOQJbwAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/143190", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rbbVbv8vXO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
