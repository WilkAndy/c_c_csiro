No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. Excluded mass regions for Majorana and Dirac neutrinos are presented using two approaches for interactions that violate lepton and lepton-flavor numbers. One approach uses an effective operator framework, the other approach is guided by the Left\u2013Right Symmetric Model. The results described in this letter represent the most stringent limits to date on the masses of heavy neutrinos and WR bosons obtained in direct searches."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ocbgtyEEUOwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14110356912893496836&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
