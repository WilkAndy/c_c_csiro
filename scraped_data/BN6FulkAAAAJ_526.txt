This analysis of the lepton+jets final state is specifically designed for the particular topology that arises from the decay of highly boosted top quarks. The observed t[bar over t] invariant mass spectrum is found to be compatible with the Standard Model prediction and 95% credibility level upper limits are derived on the t[bar over t] production rate through new massive states. An upper limit of 0.7 pb is set on the production cross section times branching fraction of a narrow 1 TeV resonance. A Kaluza-Klein gluon with a mass smaller than 1.5 TeV is excluded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:RuPIJ_LgqDgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/86206", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3xujYRO6XBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
