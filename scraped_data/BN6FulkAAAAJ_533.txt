Several Higgs boson decay channels: H -> gamma gamma, H -> ZZ(()*()) -> llll, H -> ZZ -> LL nu nu, H -> ZZ -> llqq, H -> WW(()*()) -> l nu l nu and H -> WW -> l nu qq (l is e, mu) are combined in a mass range from 110 GeV to 600 GeV. The highest sensitivity is achieved in the mass range between 160 GeV and 170 GeV, where the expected 95% CL exclusion sensitivity is at Higgs boson production cross sections 2.3 times the Standard Model prediction. Upper limits on the cross section for its production are determined. Models with a fourth generation of heavy leptons and quarks with Standard Model-like couplings to the Higgs boson are also investigated and are excluded at 95% CL for a Higgs boson mass in the range from 140 GeV to 185 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:--G0sfWZqeYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/35436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-1-geNipkN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
