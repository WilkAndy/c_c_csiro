Results are presented based on the analysis of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb(-1). No excess above Standard Model expectations is observed. A W ' with Sequential Standard Model couplings is excluded at the 95% confidence level for masses up to 2.15 TeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:zpiM1xuKXZIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/35916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-gibRd8rw9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
