The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2010 and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of similar to 40 pb(-1). No statistically significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed in the search region of dilepton invariant mass above 110 GeV. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the cross section times branching ratio of Z' resonances decaying to dielectrons and dimuons as a function of the resonance mass. A lower mass limit of 1.048 TeV on the Sequential Standard Model Z' boson is derived, as well as mass limits on Z* and E(6)-motivated Z' models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:pbjxn5iCWp4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/35453", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P8vYW4RhbqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
