The data were recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2010 and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 35\u2009\u2009pb-1 [pb superscript -1]. No excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. Limits are set on the parameters of the minimal supergravity framework, extending previous limits. Within this framework, for A0=0\u2009\u2009[A subscript 0 = 0] GeV, tan\u2061\u03b2=3 [tan beta = 3], and \u03bc>0 [mu > 0] and for equal squark and gluino masses, gluino masses below 700 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:tENBw-I8_u0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/65134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m4sAP1X-IpYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
