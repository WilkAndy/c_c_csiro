Several Higgs boson decay channels: H\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, H\u2192 ZZ (\u2217)\u2192 \u2113\u2113\u2113\u2113, H\u2192 ZZ\u2192 \u2113\u2113\u03bd\u03bd, H\u2192 ZZ\u2192 \u2113\u2113qq, H\u2192 WW (\u2217)\u2192 \u2113\u03bd\u2113\u03bd and H\u2192 WW\u2192 \u2113\u03bdqq (\u2113 is e, \u00b5) are combined in a mass range from 110 GeV to 600 GeV. The highest sensitivity is achieved in the mass range between 160 GeV and 170 GeV, where the expected 95% CL exclusion sensitivity is at Higgs boson production cross sections 2.3 times the Standard Model prediction. Upper limits on the cross section for its production are determined. Models with a fourth generation of heavy leptons and quarks with Standard Model-like couplings to the Higgs boson are also investigated and are excluded at 95% CL for a Higgs boson mass in the range from 140 GeV to 185 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:nnY02KzVmVkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/92006/92006.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WElxA4ZE8oMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
