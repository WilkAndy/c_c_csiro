The cross-section is measured from a minimum pT of 1 GeV to a maximum of 70 GeV and for rapidities within |y|<2.4 giving the widest reach of any measurement of [J over \u03c8] production to date. The differential production cross-sections of prompt and non-prompt [J over \u03c8] are separately determined and are compared to Colour Singlet NNLO*, Colour Evaporation Model, and FONLL predictions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:0dsCFdkECCQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/95926", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xWVQ4qMLqDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
