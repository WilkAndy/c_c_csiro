In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.\u00a9 2010 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:atgDo0Ffd_sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=16916811", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EutStzZsChMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
