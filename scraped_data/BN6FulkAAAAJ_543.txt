In addition, measurements of the W+ and W\u2212 production cross sections and of the lepton charge asymmetry are reported. Theoretical predictions based on NNLO QCD calculations are found to agree with the measurements"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ODSaxuuKfFwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:439405", "cites_per_year": {}}
