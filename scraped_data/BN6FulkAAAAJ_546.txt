During 2002, three beam runs were carried out in May/June, July and August. In the August 2002 beam test period four irradiated modules, two``K5''end-cap and two barrel, with the final design were tested. Module propierties (efficiency, charge collection, signal/noise, pulse shape) and the dependence of them for a particle high incidence angle was studied. A comparison with previous testbeam results was also performed. Time-stamping performance of SCT modules and specially, the effect of irradiation on the time characteristics of the Front End was investigated more closely. On this note we show a summary of these studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/774542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qx4HDgxRExgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
