Measurements have established the tracking performance of the nal design of the various SCT geometrical module types. Importantly, the depence of the performance on the operating conditions has been studied in detail. In this article, an overview of the test beam setup and methodology and the most important results will be given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7549386951981160348&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nFfOOG_PxGgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
