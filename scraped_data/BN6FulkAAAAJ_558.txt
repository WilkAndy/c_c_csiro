B", "volume": "611", "abstract": "Results from the {nu}{sub {tau}} appearance search in a neutrino beam using the full NOMAD data sample are reported. A new analysis unifies all the hadronic {tau} decays, significantly improving the overall sensitivity of the experiment to oscillations. The 'blind analysis' of all topologies yields no evidence for an oscillation signal. In the two-family oscillation scenario, this sets a 90% CL allowed region in the sin{sup 2}2{theta}{sub {mu}}{sub {tau}}-{delta}m{sup 2} plane which includes sin{sup 2}2{theta}{sub {mu}}{sub {tau}}<3.3x10{sup -4} at large {delta}m{sup 2} and {delta}m{sup 2}< 0.7 eV{sup 2}/c{sup 4} at sin{sup 2}2{theta}{sub {mu}}{sub {tau}}=1. The corresponding contour in the {nu}{sub e}{yields}{nu}{sub {tau}} oscillation hypothesis results in sin{sup 2}2{theta}{sub e{tau}}<1.5x10{sup -2} at large {delta}m{sup 2} and {delta}m{sup 2}<5.9 eV{sup 2}/c{sup 4} at sin{sup 2}2{theta}{sub e{tau}}=1. We also derive limits on effective couplings of the {tau} lepton to {nu}{sub {mu}} or {nu}{sub e}."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:M_hJRgAi9DwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20451460", "cites_per_year": {}}
