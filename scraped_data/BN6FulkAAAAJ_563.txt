In all, 13 fully populated modules constructed from pre\u2212 series silicon detectors and the ABCD2T readout chip were tested, including examples of both barrel and forward modules in several variations of hybrid technology. Furthermore, several of the modules were constructed with irradiated silicon detectors and one had been irradiated as a complete module, to a fluence of 3\u00d7 1014 p/cm2 using 24 GeV/c protons at the CERN PS. Beamtests took the form of threshold scans measuring the response to a 180 GeV pion beam at a variety of incidence angles, magnetic field levels and detector bias voltages. Results of several independent analyses are included, with a description of the common DST and summary ntuple formats now adopted within the SCT beamtest community."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/528584/files/p104.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zuJWc9KbRYcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
