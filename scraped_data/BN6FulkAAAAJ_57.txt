Here we report the structure, at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution, of PP1c in complex with a 13 residue peptide (G M [63\u201375]) of G M. The residues in G M [63\u201375] that interact with PP1c are those in the Arg/Lys\u2013Val/Ile\u2013Xaa\u2013Phe motif that is present in almost every other identified mammalian PP1-binding subunit. Disrupting this motif in the G M [63\u201375] peptide and the M 110 [1\u201338] peptide (which mimics the myofibrillar targeting M 110 subunit in stimulating the dephosphorylation of myosin) prevents these peptides from interacting with PP1. A short peptide from the PP1-binding protein p53BP2 that contains the RVXF motif also interacts with PP1c. These findings identify a recognition site on PP1c, invariant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 749, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9490338392783672198", "cites_id": ["9490338392783672198"], "pub_url": "https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/16.8.1876", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hlMffHx0tIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 8, "1998": 33, "1999": 35, "2000": 48, "2001": 43, "2002": 34, "2003": 30, "2004": 39, "2005": 40, "2006": 28, "2007": 46, "2008": 34, "2009": 24, "2010": 30, "2011": 29, "2012": 32, "2013": 32, "2014": 22, "2015": 26, "2016": 18, "2017": 16, "2018": 22, "2019": 21, "2020": 17, "2021": 14, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
