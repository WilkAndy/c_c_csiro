The Standard Model of Particle Physics predicts that CP violation will occur if this matrix contains complex elements. Conservation of probability requires that this matrix be unitary. This in turn requires that V{sub ud}V{sub ub} + V{sub cd}V{sub cb} + V{sub td}V{sub tb}{sup *} =0. When this relation is shown on a complex plane it forms the so-called Unitarity triangle and CP violation results if the angles of the triangle are non zero. The decay B{yields}{pi}{pi} is expected to exhibit CP-violation. More-over within the Standard Model the size of the effect is sensitive to the second angle of the CKM matrix {phi}{sub 2} This talk will present the current status of BELLE's measurements of B{yields}{pi}{pi} and our plans for obtaining {phi}{sub 2}."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Ml5El5xykBAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20181635", "cites_per_year": {}}
