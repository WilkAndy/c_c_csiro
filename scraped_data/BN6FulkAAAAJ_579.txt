The Standard Model of Particle Physics predicts that there will be sizable CP violating effects in some rare decays of B mesons. The primary aim of the BELLE experiment is to search for this CP violation in the B meson system. If we find such processes it will be only the second time such effects have been found in nature. In addition the richness of the predicted effects in the B meson system enable stringent tests of the Standard Model in this to-now un-explored region. To do this the BELLE experiment exploits the high luminosity KEKB accelerator in Japan. This collides 8.0GeV e{sup -} with 3.5GeV e{sup +} particles at luminosities above 2.0xl0{sup 33}cm{sup 2}sec{sup -1}. The interaction point of the accelerator is surrounded by the sophisticated BELLE detector which employs state of the hardware to perform vetexing, tracking, momentum and energy measurements along with particle identification for all long lived charged and neutral particles (except neutrinos). This presentation will introduce the main features of the BELLE experiment along with initial results for CP violation, B mixing and rare B decays."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20181564", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NT8AVZXuYp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
