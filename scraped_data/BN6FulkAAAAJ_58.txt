In total, 317 candidates, with a background expectation of 68\u00b110 events, are observed in double-leptonic decay final states with electrons, muons and missing transverse momentum. The total cross-section is determined to be $\\sigma _{WZ}^{\\mathrm {tot}}= 19.0^{+1.4}_{-1.3}\\text{(stat.)}\\pm0.9\\text{(syst.)}\\pm 0.4\\text{(lumi.)}~\\mbox{pb}$, consistent with the Standard Model expectation of . Limits on anomalous triple gauge boson couplings are derived using the transverse momentum spectrum of Z bosons in the selected events. The cross-section is also presented as a function of Z boson transverse momentum and diboson invariant mass."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:0d9pApVQ-n0C", "num_citations": 744, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15880320105496158865,10335263144250647232,2187031661515347795,18126310811517486473,11565892672934341254,2667041022938886854,12219538759698266386,12199029915343601186", "cites_id": ["15880320105496158865", "10335263144250647232", "2187031661515347795", "18126310811517486473", "11565892672934341254", "2667041022938886854", "12219538759698266386", "12199029915343601186"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2173-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kaKXl_86YtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 85, "2013": 146, "2014": 123, "2015": 104, "2016": 82, "2017": 71, "2018": 34, "2019": 61, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
