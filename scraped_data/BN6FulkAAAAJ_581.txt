The data were collected during the H8 beam test at CERN in 1995 and at a beam test at KEK in 1996. The binary modules tested had been assembled from silicon micro-strip detectors of different layout and from front-end electronics chips of different architecture. The efficiency, noise occupancy, and position resolution were determined as a function of the threshold setting for various bias voltages and angles of incidence. Interstrip effects were also evaluated using a high resolution telescope. The performance of a prototype detector module irradiated to a fiuence of 1.2 \u00d7 1014p/cm2 is also characterized."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920563297005653", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VJTkoh0FNEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
