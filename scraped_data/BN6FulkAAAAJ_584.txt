The beam test infrastructure was similar to that described in 1]. The following sections describe the module construction, the beam telescope, the data analysis, and the module performance as a function of the operating parameters studied in the beam test."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/686029/files/indet-97-175.ps.gz", "cites_per_year": {}}
