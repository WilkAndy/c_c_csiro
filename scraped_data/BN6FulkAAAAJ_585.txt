Results are presented from laboratory work with the full 11.955 cm-long module along with earlier test-beam studies with the module athalf-length'(6.3778 cm long strips). The detectors incorporate radial n+-type strips which would measure \u03c6-coordinate in the ATLAS collider geometry. The isolation technique is that of individual p-stops and the pitch varies from 70\u03bcm at the narrow end to 90\u03bcm at the broad end. The module was equipped with CAFE and CDP binary readout electronics offering 40MHz sampling. The CAFE chips were found to exhibit an excessive degree of pedestal variation, however by correcting for this effect in order to isolate the detector properties, the beam test study indicates a minimum-ionising particle detection efficiency consistent with 99% or above up to a threshold of 1.9 fC at 300V reverse bias. The noise occupancy for the full length module is less than 10-3 for thesholds above 0.8 fC giving a useful thresholdheadroom'of 1.1 fC, pre-irradiation. Figures for the intrinsic spatial resolution within this threshold operation range are found to be consistent withstrip pitch\u221a"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/686028/files/indet-97-174.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f_5RitUxDiIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
