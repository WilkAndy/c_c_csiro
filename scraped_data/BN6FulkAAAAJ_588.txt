The detector consisted of 128 strips on a 50\u00b5m pitch, with a wafer thickness of 200\u00b5m. Operating at a bias of 180V, the detector produced a signal to noise ratio of 19 to 1, with a particle detection efficiency of better than 99%. The spatial resolution of the detector was measured as 14.6\u00b5m without charge sharing effects. Charge sharing between pairs of strips was seen to improve the spatial resolution, with an average value for all events of 10.4\u00b5m."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cds.cern.ch/record/685970/files/indet-96-123.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2k3p9SAmcmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
