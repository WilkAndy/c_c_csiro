Four kinematic regions are explored using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb\u2212 1. No excess of events beyond expectations from Standard Model processes is observed, and limits are set on large extra dimensions and the pair production of dark matter particles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 728, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8274606671386213419,12995586479577048271,7002439371836982649,452253695403343413,6388735430919836154,1971151425299117470", "cites_id": ["8274606671386213419", "12995586479577048271", "7002439371836982649", "452253695403343413", "6388735430919836154", "1971151425299117470"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/jhep04(2013)075", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K3wNSO1O1XIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 12, "2013": 136, "2014": 185, "2015": 141, "2016": 108, "2017": 57, "2018": 32, "2019": 16, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
