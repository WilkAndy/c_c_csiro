The detectors have been irradiated by neutrons with fluences of up to 1.5 \u00d7 1014 neutrons/cm2. The electric field in the detectors before and after type inversion, the depletion voltage and the dark current were studied."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168900295001115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yD-7YEo0RLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
