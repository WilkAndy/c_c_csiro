Initially three ion sources were in operation:-conventional duoplasmatrons for proton and helium beams and a sputter ion source for heavy ions. An electrostatic focussing system was designed and built in-house for providing microbeams (2). The research emphasis has been largely on microbeam PIXE with particular reference to the mining industry#'. An AMS system was added in 1990 which prevented the inclusion of the charge exchange canal required for helium beams. The facility has been operated by CSIRO Division of Exploration and Mining.At the beginning of 1992, the Ion Beam Technology Group of CSIRO Division of Applied Physics was relocated at Lindfield and became a major user of the HIAF facility. Because the research activities of this group involved Rutherford Backscattering and Channelling, it was necessary to add a helium ion source and a new high vacuum beam line incorporating a precision goniometer. These facilities became operational in the second quarter of 1992. Currently a PIXE system is being added to the chamber containing the goniometer, making the accelerator an extremely versatile one for a wide range of I BA techniques."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/445948", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3XUw102JiKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
