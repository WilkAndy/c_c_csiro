The detector response to minimum ionizing particles (mip) was found to be close to that of non-irradiated detectors. The short integration time of the preamplifier makes the shot noise caused by the detector dark current tolerable up to at least 15 plA per channel."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:plOeWmaeDcAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/40872079/CM-P00060670.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1RLtSDACHOMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
