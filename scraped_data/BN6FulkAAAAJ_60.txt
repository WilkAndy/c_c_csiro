This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the distribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane, with the coefficients v n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v 2\u2013v 6 values are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5< p T< 20 GeV), pseudorapidity (| \u03b7|< 2.5), and centrality using an event plane method. The v n values for n\u2265 3 are found to vary weakly with both \u03b7 and centrality, and their p T dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation, v n 1/n (p T)\u221d v 2 1/2 (p T), except in the top 5% most central collisions.
