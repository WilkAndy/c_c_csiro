The HARP chip, based around an analog memory, will provide data storage at LHC rates for 2 \u03bcsec and allow stored data to be accessed for trigger rates of up to 50\u2013100 KHz. We have tested two different prototypes of the final chip as front end for silicon detectors, using a Sr90 source and high energy pions and electrons from the CERN\u2010SPS test beam."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.43352", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qZv2P0fbSawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
