The data were taken at the end of 1991. Three exposures of UA2 Inner Silicon detectors were made: at+ 20 C,-15 C and-95 C. A high neutron flux enabled the required fluences to be achieved in relatively short times. This increases the sensitivity of the experiment to damage types with shorter self-annealing time constants. In an earlier experiment [3] we reported a value of the damage coefficient which was slightly higher than that measured by our collaborators in RD2 [2]. This note discusses the new data taken at+ 20 C. Analysis of the low temperature exposures is in progress."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:23087636", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YIeEbViJ3x4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
