A new skip logic controller allows to write at 66 MHz without dead time and to read out at a lower frequency simultaneously. The input circuit is charge-sensitive and integrates continuously. Pedestal non-uniformity is 1.4 mV rms from cell\u2014to\u2014cell and 3.5 mV rms between channels. The linearity range is\u20142.5 V to+ 15 V, which corresponds to 11 bits. The chip has been used in a particle detection test."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5682316968241392082&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0ukzKS2l204J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
