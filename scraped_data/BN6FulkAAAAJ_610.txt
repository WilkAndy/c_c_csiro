Measurements have established the tracking performance of prototypes of the final design of the various SCT geometrical module types under different operating conditions. Tests of irradiated modules have allowed estimation of the performance after 10 years of operation in the LHC. In this article, the test beam setup and methodology is described and an overview of the most important results presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ific.uv.es/~fuster/SCT_speakers/papers/2003/sctpapers/tbnim2003_05.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DgeSZ4uPvRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
