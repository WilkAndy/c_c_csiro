Accurate determination of elemental content from recorded spectra requires proper calibration of the XFM instrument under the relevant operating conditions. Here we describe the manufacture, characterization and utilization of multi-element thin-film reference foils (MEFs) for use in calibration of XFM measurements of biological and other specimens. We have used these internal standards to assess the 2D distribution of trace metals in a thin tissue section of a rat hippocampus. The data used in this study was acquired at the X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy beamline of the Australian Synchrotron using a new 384-element array detector (Maia) and at beamline 2-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source. Post-processing of samples by different fixation techniques was investigated, with the conclusion that differences in solvent type and sample handling can significantly alter elemental content. The present study highlights the quantitative capability, high statistical power and versatility of the XFM technique for mapping trace metals in biological samples, eg brain-tissue samples in order to help understand neurological processes, especially when implemented in conjunction with a highperformance detector such as Maia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP11169&dsid=DS7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oDUU_7WAG7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
