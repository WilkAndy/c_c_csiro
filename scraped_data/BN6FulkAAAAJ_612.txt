It aims at detecting  charged current interactions by observing the production of the  lepton through its various decay modes by means of kinematical criteria. The detector reconstructs the event kinematics and identifies electrons, muons and photons. It uses the UA1 magnet. The target consists of 44 drift chambers,(132 sensitive planes) each 2.2%  thick, with a total mass of 2.9 tons over a fiducial 2.6 x 2.6 x 4. It is followed by transition radiation detectors and an electromagnetic calorimeter which includes a preshower detector. The muons are identified after the return-yoke of the magnet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17662769522134474991&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
