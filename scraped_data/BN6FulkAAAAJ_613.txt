If the initial quark is a strange (down) quark, a charm quark may be produced via a Cabibbo enhanced (suppressed) transition. The charm quark then fragments into a charmed hadron which may decay semileptonically, producingeitherasecondmuonoranelectronwithitselectriccharge opposite to that of the muon from the leptonic vertex. This type of event is referred to as an opposite sign dilepton event. If the second lepton is a muon the event is usually labelled as a dimuon event. This process is a powerful and clean probe of both the strange component of the nucleon sea and the kinematics of heavy quark production.The phenomenon of charm production by neutrinos has been investigated by a number of experiments.
