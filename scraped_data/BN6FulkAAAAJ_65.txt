The measurements are performed using charged particles with transverse momentum p T> 0. 5 GeV and in the pseudorapidity range| \u03b7|< 2. 5 in a dataset of approximately 7 \u03bcb\u2212 1 recorded in 2010. The shapes of the v n distributions suggest that the associated flow vectors are described by a two-dimensional Gaussian function in central collisions for v 2 and over most of the measured centrality range for v 3 and v 4. Significant deviations from this function are observed for v 2 in mid-central and peripheral collisions, and a small deviation is observed for v 3 in mid-central collisions. In order to be sensitive to these deviations, it is shown that the commonly used multi-particle cumulants, involving four particles or more, need to be measured with a precision \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ZppSRAJs3i8C", "num_citations": 667, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2491393547050908996,3363960316029559772,5645963984507570220", "cites_id": ["2491393547050908996", "3363960316029559772", "5645963984507570220"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2013)183", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RH2rJzs1kyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 35, "2014": 110, "2015": 68, "2016": 109, "2017": 76, "2018": 81, "2019": 47, "2020": 33, "2021": 55, "2022": 39, "2023": 12}}
