The expectation in case of \u03b8 13= 0 is 8937 events. The deficit is interpreted as evidence of electron antineutrino disappearance. From a rate plus spectral shape analysis we find sin\ufeff 2 2 \u03b8 13= 0.109\u00b10.030 (stat)\u00b10.025 (syst). The data exclude the no-oscillation hypothesis at 99.8% CL (2.9 \u03c3)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:whZgJj6n9Y0C", "num_citations": 644, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3597489589650869743", "cites_id": ["3597489589650869743"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.86.052008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:701OsrjZ7DEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 18, "2013": 116, "2014": 120, "2015": 105, "2016": 93, "2017": 50, "2018": 42, "2019": 33, "2020": 18, "2021": 14, "2022": 24, "2023": 7}}
