The cross sections were measured using jets clustered with the anti-kT algorithm with parameters R=0.4 and R=0.6. These measurements are based on the 2010 data sample, consisting of a total integrated luminosity of 37 inverse picobarns. Inclusive jet double-differential cross sections are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum, in bins of jet rapidity. Dijet double-differential cross sections are studied as a function of the dijet invariant mass, in bins of half the rapidity separation of the two leading jets. The measurements are performed in the jet rapidity range |y|<4.4, covering jet transverse momenta from 20 GeV to 1.5 TeV and dijet invariant masses from 70 GeV to 5 TeV. The data are compared to expectations based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, as well as to next-to-leading order Monte Carlo predictions. In addition to a test of the theory in a new kinematic regime, the data also provide sensitivity to parton distribution functions in a region where they are currently not well-constrained."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 617, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13702755749724065192,14357055347165142707,195308422585604028,17089804323296462901,6710360550824356363,17782438671737748997,7713105488679060376", "cites_id": ["13702755749724065192", "14357055347165142707", "195308422585604028", "17089804323296462901", "6710360550824356363", "17782438671737748997", "7713105488679060376"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qI0-CsH3Kb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 50, "2013": 105, "2014": 80, "2015": 93, "2016": 84, "2017": 61, "2018": 45, "2019": 33, "2020": 17, "2021": 15, "2022": 21, "2023": 8}}
