Heavy top-quark partners decaying into a top quark and a neutral non-interacting particle are searched for in events with two leptons in the final state. No excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. Limits are placed on the mass of a supersymmetric scalar top and of a spin-1/2 top-quark partner. A spin-1/2 top-quark partner with a mass between 300 GeV and 480 GeV, decaying to a top quark and a neutral non-interacting particle lighter than 100 GeV, is excluded at 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:3UHJKpZgG5wC", "num_citations": 607, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10382431228827753440,1329489928653086198,12357911474837243800,876091400564477617,1884750049465315899,3306654015440570738,5317006117602863273,2849491480155854064", "cites_id": ["10382431228827753440", "1329489928653086198", "12357911474837243800", "876091400564477617", "1884750049465315899", "3306654015440570738", "5317006117602863273", "2849491480155854064"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2012)094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4FszszHOFZAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 83, "2013": 152, "2014": 124, "2015": 100, "2016": 48, "2017": 28, "2018": 21, "2019": 16, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
