Its installation was completed in August 2008 and the detector took part in data- taking with single LHC beams and cosmic rays. The initial detector operation, hardware commissioning and in-situ calibrations are described. Tracking performance has been measured with 7.6 million cosmic-ray events, collected using a tracking trigger and reconstructed with modular pattern-recognition and fitting software. The intrinsic hit efficiency and tracking trigger efficiencies are close to 100%. Lorentz angle measurements for both electrons and holes, specific energy-loss calibration and transition radiation turn-on measurements have been performed. Different alignment techniques have been used to reconstruct the detector geometry. After the initial alignment, a transverse impact parameter resolution of 22.1+/-0.9 {\\mu}m and a relative momentum resolution {\\sigma}p/p = (4.83+/-0.16) \\times 10-4 GeV-1 \\times pT have been measured for high momentum tracks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:cGKb4UeYxKMC", "num_citations": 605, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2020296526647374061,15410052704623405648", "cites_id": ["2020296526647374061", "15410052704623405648"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5293", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7bDFq_yICRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 24, "2011": 61, "2012": 46, "2013": 63, "2014": 41, "2015": 71, "2016": 55, "2017": 66, "2018": 56, "2019": 40, "2020": 32, "2021": 28, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
