Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- algorithm with distance parameters  or , and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  boson, for  and pseudorapidities . The effect of multiple proton\u2013proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:BKYZGPsuSFYC", "num_citations": 2716, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4445637337449646719,3524794406208467323,8799794600407363437,10852575382400352185,6434112919657947952,8212915609131650629,2545339984053194618,16507853878702409840,17555419214445599310,5694919324828592800,3976024451883526270", "cites_id": ["4445637337449646719", "3524794406208467323", "8799794600407363437", "10852575382400352185", "6434112919657947952", "8212915609131650629", "2545339984053194618", "16507853878702409840", "17555419214445599310", "5694919324828592800", "3976024451883526270"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-3190-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f0rmupoTsj0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 19, "2013": 23, "2014": 87, "2015": 553, "2016": 618, "2017": 557, "2018": 390, "2019": 173, "2020": 102, "2021": 93, "2022": 66, "2023": 25}}
