The cross-section is measured from a minimum pT of 1 GeV to a maximum of 70 GeV and for rapidities within |y| < 2.4 giving the widest reach of any measurement of J/psi production to date. The differential production cross-sections of prompt and non-prompt J/psi are separately determined and are compared to Colour Singlet NNLO*, Colour Evaporation Model, and FONLL predictions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 591, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6056251129256414436,8109248270637852614,10225071358570157749", "cites_id": ["6056251129256414436", "8109248270637852614", "10225071358570157749"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5AzjjVAgDFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 37, "2012": 93, "2013": 70, "2014": 87, "2015": 81, "2016": 46, "2017": 67, "2018": 49, "2019": 26, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 4}}
