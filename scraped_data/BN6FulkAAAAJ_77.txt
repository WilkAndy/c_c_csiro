The analysis is based on 4.6 fb\u2212 1 of proton-proton collision data at collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, using top quark pair events with a \u03c4 lepton in the final state. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. Assuming that the branching ratio of the charged Higgs boson to a \u03c4 lepton and a neutrino is 100%, this leads to upper limits on the branching ratio of top quark decays to abquarkandachargedHiggsbosonbetween5% and1% forchargedHiggsbosonmasses ranging from 90 GeV to 160 GeV, respectively. In the context of the scenario of the MSSM, tan \u03b2 above 12-26, as well as between 1 and 2-6, can be excluded for charged Higgs boson masses between 90 GeV and 150 GeV."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Ltc9rfRcsxEC", "num_citations": 547, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3223129214421875563,5868023627293099495,6421247168892477166,14864571389780655041,18126310811517486473,10751317600199018649,12219538759698266386,9070074205447003852,2686695100125379380", "cites_id": ["3223129214421875563", "5868023627293099495", "6421247168892477166", "14864571389780655041", "18126310811517486473", "10751317600199018649", "12219538759698266386", "9070074205447003852", "2686695100125379380"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP06(2012)039", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a7vMkvHauiwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 56, "2013": 185, "2014": 111, "2015": 52, "2016": 48, "2017": 33, "2018": 23, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
