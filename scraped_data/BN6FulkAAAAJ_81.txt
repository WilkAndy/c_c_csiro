The data were recorded in 2011 by the ATLAS experiment in s=7 TeV proton\u2013proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed in 1.04  fb\u22121 of data. Gluino and squark masses below 700 GeV and 875 GeV respectively are excluded at the 95% confidence level in simplified models containing only squarks of the first two generations, a gluino octet and a massless neutralino. The exclusion limit increases to 1075 GeV for squarks and gluinos of equal mass. In MSUGRA/CMSSM models with tan\u03b2=10, A0=0 and \u03bc>0, squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded for masses below 950 GeV. These limits extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 528, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9412179707364787837,3364515194771770430,4430920989454624629,15122139540431790711,15062352646571643850,15471211699838511158,9788857216243374883,11695788393566284812,7328013619736041748,15511808277069520524,4355297685926920290,906689033374624023", "cites_id": ["9412179707364787837", "3364515194771770430", "4430920989454624629", "15122139540431790711", "15062352646571643850", "15471211699838511158", "9788857216243374883", "11695788393566284812", "7328013619736041748", "15511808277069520524", "4355297685926920290", "906689033374624023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026931200192X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fUaec5PHnoIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 85, "2012": 247, "2013": 90, "2014": 42, "2015": 19, "2016": 24, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
