In a sample of lead\u2013lead collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 7 \u03bcb\u22121, ATLAS has measured jets with a calorimeter system over the pseudorapidity interval |\u03b7|<2.1 and over the transverse momentum range 38<pT<210 GeV. Jets were reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm with values for the distance parameter that determines the nominal jet radius of R=0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The centrality dependence of the jet yield is characterized by the jet \u201ccentral-to-peripheral ratio,\u201d RCP. Jet production is found to be suppressed by approximately a factor of two in the 10% most central collisions relative to peripheral collisions. RCP varies smoothly with centrality as characterized by the number of participating nucleons.
