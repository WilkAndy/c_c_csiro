The search is sensitive to heavy neutral Z\u2032 gauge bosons, Randall-Sundrum gravitons, Z* bosons, techni-mesons, Kaluza-Klein Z/\u03b3 bosons, and bosons predicted by Torsion models. Results are presented based on an analysis of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb\u2212 1 in the e+ e\u2212 channel and 5.0 fb\u2212 1 in the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 channel. A Z\u2032 boson with Standard Model-like couplings is excluded at 95% confidence level for masses below 2.22 TeV. A Randall-Sundrum graviton with coupling is excluded at 95% confidence level for masses below 2.16 TeV. Limits on the other models are also presented, including Technicolor and Minimal Z\u2032 Models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:OC7j4ufeY2cC", "num_citations": 512, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14448278653324955914,1329489928653086198,15071104537835496235,16496499831183192152,3306654015440570738,5317006117602863273,2485101792803342843,14178647729903835664,13419636054727087574", "cites_id": ["14448278653324955914", "1329489928653086198", "15071104537835496235", "16496499831183192152", "3306654015440570738", "5317006117602863273", "2485101792803342843", "14178647729903835664", "13419636054727087574"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2012)138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ChFLi-KYgsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 33, "2013": 123, "2014": 106, "2015": 80, "2016": 66, "2017": 23, "2018": 28, "2019": 18, "2020": 10, "2021": 17, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
