Events are selected in the single lepton topology by requiring an electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and at least three jets. With a data sample of 35 pb\u22121, two different multivariate methods, one of which uses b-quark jet identification while the other does not, use kinematic variables to obtain cross-section measurements of \u03c3tt\u00af=187\u00b111(stat.)\u221217+18(syst.)\u00b16(lumi.) pb and \u03c3tt\u00af=173\u00b117(stat.)\u221216+18(syst.)\u00b16(lumi.) pb respectively. The two measurements are in agreement with each other and with QCD calculations. The first measurement has a better a priori sensitivity and constitutes the main result of this Letter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 507, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11258090590932425922", "cites_id": ["11258090590932425922"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312003814", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wtyxmb7FPJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 61, "2013": 90, "2014": 48, "2015": 71, "2016": 73, "2017": 77, "2018": 45, "2019": 20, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 10}}
