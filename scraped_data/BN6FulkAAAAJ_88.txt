In a sample of minimum-bias lead\u2013lead collisions at a nucleon\u2013nucleon centre of mass energy sNN=2.76 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 6.7 \u03bcb\u22121, J/\u03c8 mesons are reconstructed via their decays to \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 pairs. The measured J/\u03c8 yield, normalized to the number of binary nucleon\u2013nucleon collisions, is found to significantly decrease from peripheral to central collisions. The centrality dependence is found to be qualitatively similar to the trends observed at previous, lower energy experiments. The same sample is used to reconstruct Z bosons in the \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 final state, and a total of 38 candidates are selected in the mass window of 66 to 116 GeV. The relative Z yields as a function of centrality are also presented, although \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 490, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3420205086457441041,9409883602682735998,17972186239594593507,18304522409791648298", "cites_id": ["3420205086457441041", "9409883602682735998", "17972186239594593507", "18304522409791648298"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269311001389", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EatHtWcCdy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 70, "2012": 116, "2013": 67, "2014": 50, "2015": 52, "2016": 25, "2017": 20, "2018": 49, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
