Selected events feature one electron or muon, missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets, exactly one of them identified as originating from a b quark. The cross section is measured by fitting the distribution of a multivariate discriminant constructed with a neural network, yielding \u03c3t=83\u00b14(stat.)\u221219+20(syst.) pb, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the Standard Model. Using the ratio of the measured to the theoretically predicted cross section and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |Vtb|\u226b|Vts|,|Vtd|, the coupling strength at the W-t-b vertex is determined to be |Vtb|=1.13\u22120.13+0.14. If it is assumed that |Vtb|\u2a7d1 a lower limit of |Vtb|>0.75 is obtained at the 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 489, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8889300958967403594,6561295317060379988,6678399955695608930", "cites_id": ["8889300958967403594", "6561295317060379988", "6678399955695608930"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312009781", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SpTK6B8kXXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 30, "2013": 142, "2014": 92, "2015": 74, "2016": 39, "2017": 46, "2018": 15, "2019": 6, "2020": 21, "2021": 4, "2022": 14, "2023": 2}}
