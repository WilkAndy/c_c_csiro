The reconstruction of tracks, leptons, photons, missing energy and jets is investigated, together with the performance of b-tagging and the trigger. The physics potential for a variety of interesting physics processes, within the Standard Model and beyond, is examined. The study comprises a series of notes based on simulations of the detector and physics processes, with particular emphasis given to the data expected from the first years of operation of the LHC at CERN."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:Z2jP5KqOl2EC", "num_citations": 2266, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=452481873063125376", "cites_id": ["452481873063125376"], "pub_url": "https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/23987", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gCE7v92JRwYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 91, "2009": 238, "2010": 356, "2011": 344, "2012": 320, "2013": 220, "2014": 147, "2015": 151, "2016": 120, "2017": 77, "2018": 53, "2019": 44, "2020": 40, "2021": 25, "2022": 21, "2023": 6}}
