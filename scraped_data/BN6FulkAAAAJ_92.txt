First, the calorimeter response to single isolated charged hadrons is measured and compared to the Monte Carlo simulation using proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of  and 7 TeV collected during 2009 and 2010. Then, using the decay of K  s  and \u039b particles, the calorimeter response to specific types of particles (positively and negatively charged pions, protons, and anti-protons) is measured and compared to the Monte Carlo predictions. Finally, the jet energy scale uncertainty is determined by propagating the response uncertainty for single charged and neutral particles to jets. The response uncertainty is 2\u20135 % for central isolated hadrons and 1\u20133 % for the final calorimeter jet energy scale."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:8cBNEdFwSQkC", "num_citations": 454, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5149929839618096988,5035543086847780215", "cites_id": ["5149929839618096988", "5035543086847780215"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2305-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XP-eVOc5eEcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 14, "2013": 40, "2014": 61, "2015": 86, "2016": 78, "2017": 69, "2018": 57, "2019": 15, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 8}}
