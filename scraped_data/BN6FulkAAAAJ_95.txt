Events are selected with a single lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum and at least four jets of which at least one jet is identified as coming from a b-quark. A kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the  event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The measured value of A  C  is , consistent with the prediction from the MC@NLO Monte Carlo generator of A  C =0.006\u00b10.002.
