A new analysis unifies all the hadronic \u03c4 decays, significantly improving the overall sensitivity of the experiment to oscillations. The \u201cblind analysis\u201d of all topologies yields no evidence for an oscillation signal. In the two-family oscillation scenario, this sets a 90% CL allowed region in the sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4\u2013\u0394m2 plane which includes sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4<3.3\u00d710\u22124 at large \u0394m2 and \u0394m2< 0.7 eV2/c4 at sin22\u03b8\u03bc\u03c4=1. The corresponding contour in the \u03bde\u2192\u03bd\u03c4 oscillation hypothesis results in sin22\u03b8e\u03c4<1.5\u00d710\u22122 at large \u0394m2 and \u0394m2<5.9 eV2/c4 at sin22\u03b8e\u03c4=1. We also derive limits on effective couplings of the \u03c4 lepton to \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bde."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 429, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6796152088423738567,8876234005167399019,12830516913043632261,11651763437581098095", "cites_id": ["6796152088423738567", "8876234005167399019", "12830516913043632261", "11651763437581098095"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S055032130100339X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x6wGHlHIUF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 11, "2002": 51, "2003": 31, "2004": 23, "2005": 24, "2006": 24, "2007": 22, "2008": 16, "2009": 21, "2010": 23, "2011": 16, "2012": 12, "2013": 18, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 13, "2017": 13, "2018": 16, "2019": 12, "2020": 22, "2021": 10, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
