The results are based on 2250 W\u2192 \u2113\u03bd and 179 Z/\u03b3*\u2192 \u2113\u2113 candidate events selected from a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 320 nb. The measured total W and Z/\u03b3\u2217-boson production cross sections times the respective leptonic branching ratios for the combined electron and muon channels are. BR (W\u2192 \u2113\u03bd)= 9.96\u00b10.23 (stat)\u00b10.50 (syst)\u00b11.10 (lumi) nb and BR (Z/\u03b3\u2217\u2192 \u2113\u2113)= 0. 82\u00b10. 06 (stat)\u00b10. 05 (syst)\u00b10. 09 (lumi) nb (within the invariant mass window 66< m \u2113\u2113< 116GeV). The W/Z cross-section ratio is measured to be 11.7\u00b10.9 (stat)\u00b10.4 (syst). In addition, measurements of the W+ and W\u2212 production cross sections and of the lepton charge asymmetry are reported.
