The measurements use data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb\u22121. The b-jets are identified using either a lifetime-based method, where secondary decay vertices of b-hadrons in jets are reconstructed using information from the tracking detectors, or a muon-based method where the presence of a muon is used to identify semileptonic decays of b-hadrons inside jets. The inclusive b-jet cross-section is measured as a function of transverse momentum in the range 20<p T<400 GeV and rapidity in the range |y|<2.1. The -dijet cross-section is measured as a function of the dijet invariant mass in the range 110<m jj<760 GeV, the azimuthal angle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BN6FulkAAAAJ:GO2DTSf4MZMC", "num_citations": 407, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5981764615177500546,2569567622313453771,13343854724021852423,8295566058725373176,12263238554306501007,7558016014194920923,6441296369917906774,5376254142181171567", "cites_id": ["5981764615177500546", "2569567622313453771", "13343854724021852423", "8295566058725373176", "12263238554306501007", "7558016014194920923", "6441296369917906774", "5376254142181171567"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1846-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gveniTl_A1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 57, "2012": 84, "2013": 70, "2014": 30, "2015": 24, "2016": 38, "2017": 33, "2018": 15, "2019": 16, "2020": 9, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 4}}
