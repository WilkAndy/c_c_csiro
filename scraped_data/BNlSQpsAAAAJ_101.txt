We characterized soil organic P that was mobilized by organic anions and assessed its amenability to hydrolysis by phosphatase enzymes.Six soils differing in organic P concentration were extracted with citrate, malate or oxalate solutions and incubated with preparations of phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, or phytase. Organic P compounds present in these extracts were putatively identified and quantified with solution 31P-NMR spectroscopy and the enzyme-labile P fractions were assessed by changes in molybdate-reactive P (MRP) concentration.Organic P mobilization varied markedly among the organic anions. Extraction with 10 mM citrate was most effective and extracted 7.8-fold more total P than the water controls across all soils.
