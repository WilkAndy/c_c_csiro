Genotypic variation in plant growth and P uptake were apparent in both soils at two harvests made at 21 and 35 days after sowing. A significant P fertilizer response was observed on both soils. Total P uptake by the genotypes was closely correlated with shoot biomass, suggesting that shoot biomass may be a reliable parameter to select for P-uptake efficiency in short-term pot bioassays. This variation may provide opportunities for developing molecular markers for wheat breeding programs to improve P-uptake efficiency in wheat."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3271341935898506985", "cites_id": ["3271341935898506985"], "pub_url": "http://www.cropscience.org.au/icsc2004/poster/2/5/4/697_liaomt.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6bYRjCgkZi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
