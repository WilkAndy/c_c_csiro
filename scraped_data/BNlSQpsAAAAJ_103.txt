They have been identified in rye and localized on chromosomes 6R and 3R, respectively. Materials employed were hexaploid wheat (cv. Chinese Spring), and two wheatrye addition lines (3R-AL and 6R-AL). Seedlings were treated with and without Al for 24 h to examine genes upregulated or down-regulated by Al. Measurements of root growth at different Al concentrations showed the Al tolerance was higher in 3R-AL than in 6R-AL and wheat. Initial transcriptomic results revealed that more genes changed expression (>10 fold) in the wheat and in the 6R-AL line (moderately tolerant) than in the 3R-AL line (highly tolerant). A method was developed to determine whether candidate genes are involved in Al tolerance or in responses to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9296312056808722160", "cites_id": ["9296312056808722160"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10535-018-0804-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8M5Dy48iA4EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 6}}
