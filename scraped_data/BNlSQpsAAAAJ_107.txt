After screening conventional germplasm for Al3+ tolerance in hydroponics, 18 genotypes were further characterized in a short-term soil experiment. Among the Brazilian cultivars, Antarctica 01 and BRS Mariana showed the greatest relative root length (RRL) in acid soil. However, these cultivars were significantly less tolerant than the foreign cultivars Dayton (USA) and Murasakimochi (Japan) and the transgenic line L5 which out-performed all conventional genotypes. In long-term growth trials, the transgenic line produced the greatest relative root and relative shoot dry weight. Relative grain yield was greatest in the transgenic line and Dayton.
