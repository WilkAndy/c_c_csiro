For eukaryotic host-associated communities, however, plastid and mitochondrial genes are often co-amplified with, and greatly outnumber, bacterial 16S rDNA. This makes it difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of target 16S rDNA sequences to characterize the diversity of endophytic bacterial communities. This chapter describes a method that improves the amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA from plant tissues by using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) PCR clamp. The PNA clamp selectively binds to a targeted region of the plant genome and inhibits its amplification during PCR. PNA clamps are especially useful for characterizing bacterial communities on plant tissues with lower levels of microbial colonization such as the root tips and leaves."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16207714568337981134", "cites_id": ["16207714568337981134"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-1040-4_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zn61Gode7eAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4}}
