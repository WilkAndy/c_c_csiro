When Cl\u2212 is included in the bathing solution, changes in the cellular concentrations of ammonium, K+, Cl\u2212 and Na+ have been shown to meet the requirements for electroneutrality and to account for the changes in vacuolar osmotic pressure associated with ammonium uptake. If accumulation occurs in the absence of external Cl\u2212, however; changes in the inorganic ions do not meet these criteria. Malate is found in the vacuoles of cells accumulating amine in the absence of external Cl\u2212 and its presence (at 0\u00b75 to 8\u00b75 mol m\u22123) allows us to account for electroneutrality and for changes in the osmotic potential."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11206005297623190309", "cites_id": ["11206005297623190309"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/44/3/637/557279", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jcv5O3K6g5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
