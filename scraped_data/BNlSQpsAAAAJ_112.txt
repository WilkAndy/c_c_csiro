When root tips of a pair isogenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines were exposed to 100 \u03bcM Er containing 0.2 mM CaCl2 (pH 4.3) for 4 h, a greater amount of malate was exuded from the Al-resistant genotype (ET8) than from the Al-sensitive genotype (ES8). Previous studies using these genotypes (Delhaize et al. 1993b, Plant Physiol. 103, 695\u2013693; Ryan et al. 1995, Planta 196, 103\u2013110) showed that Al-activated malate efflux from root apices is a likely mechanism of Al resistance in wheat (the \u201cmalate hypothesis\u201d). In contrast to Al, Er inhibited root growth of both genotypes equally. Er-activated malate efflux cosegregated with Al resistance in wheat seedlings derived from a cross between Al-sensitive and Al-resistant near-isogenic lines. This co-segregation suggests that the Er-stimulated malate efflux is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6359688719607119745", "cites_id": ["6359688719607119745"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-306-47624-X_243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gb89BjInQlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
