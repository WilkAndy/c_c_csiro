Aluminium (Al3+) stress is the main cause of this limitation primarily because the toxic Al3+ present in acid soils inhibit root growth. Current breeding programs do not target acid soil tolerance in B. napus because genetic variation and convincing QTL for this trait have not been reported. To investigate this, we conducted a genome-wide associated study (GWAS) using the BnASSYST diversity panel of B. napus genotyped with 35,729 high-quality genotyping-by-sequencing based DArTseq markers. We screened 352 B. napus accessions in hydroponics with and without a toxic concentration of AlCl3 (12 \u03bcM, pH 4.3) for 12 days and measured shoot biomass, root biomass, and root length. Significant variation for these traits was observed. By accounting for both population structure and kinship matrices, five \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4771716020489181769,6213746805438176719", "cites_id": ["4771716020489181769", "6213746805438176719"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp22073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SVpMYnCKOEIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
