Here, in replicated controlled-environment studies, the effect of early shoot vigour on root biomass, rhizosheath size, root hair length, and cell size in the roots and leaves was examined across different cycles of selection. Increased shoot vigour was associated with greater root biomass, larger rhizosheath size, and longer root hairs. Our findings demonstrate that rhizosheath size was a reliable surrogate for root hair length in this germplasm. Examination of the root epidermis revealed that the \u2018cell body\u2019 of the trichoblasts (hair-forming cells) and the atrichoblasts (non-hair-forming cells) decreased in size as shoot vigour increased. Therefore, in higher vigour germplasm, longer root hairs emerged from smaller trichoblasts so that total trichoblast volume (root hair plus cell body) was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7521567494025252028", "cites_id": ["7521567494025252028"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/73/8/2499/6535093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vAyA68j5YWgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
