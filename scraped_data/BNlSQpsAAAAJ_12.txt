On these soils it can be necessary to apply up to five-fold more P as fertiliser than is exported in products. Given the finite nature of global P resources, it is important that such inefficiencies be addressed. For low P-sorbing soils, P-efficient farming systems will also assist attempts to reduce pollution associated with P losses to the environment. P-balance inefficiency of farms is associated with loss of P in erosion, runoff or leaching, uneven dispersal of animal excreta, and accumulation of P as sparingly-available phosphate and organic P in the soil. In many cases it is possible to minimise P losses in runoff or erosion. Uneven dispersal of P in excreta typically amounts to ~5% of P-fertiliser inputs. However, the rate of P accumulation in moderate to highly P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 415, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14987607955258636192", "cites_id": ["14987607955258636192"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-011-0880-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oHcCDgeu_s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 12, "2013": 19, "2014": 20, "2015": 45, "2016": 38, "2017": 28, "2018": 51, "2019": 40, "2020": 37, "2021": 42, "2022": 47, "2023": 28}}
