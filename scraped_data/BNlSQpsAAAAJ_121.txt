Previous research showed introgression of the TaMATE1B and TaALMT1 genes individually increased the Al3+ tolerance of durum wheat. Here we aimed to (a) combine the genes into a single durum line, (b) compare the various introgression lines and (c) establish the effectiveness of the introgressions in improving the acid soil tolerance in the field.Durum wheat lines homozygous for Al3+-tolerant alleles of TaMATE1B and TaALMT1 were crossed to develop a line that incorporated both genes. The parental cultivar, lines with the individual genes and the line with both genes introgressed were screened for Al3+ tolerance by hydroponic and soil cultures in a growth cabinet. The lines were also assessed for biomass production and grain yield in the field on acid soils.The durum wheat lines with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9806113452410042001", "cites_id": ["9806113452410042001"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-022-05756-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kXYU3jpQFogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
