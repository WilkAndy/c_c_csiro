The Al-tolerant barley cultivars were reported to mainly rely on the Al-activated efflux of citrate from root apices, but the key mechanisms for Al tolerance may differ for wild relatives of barley adapted to acid soil.Here, we investigated plant Al tolerance from evolutionary physiological, molecular, and ecological perspectives.Phylogenetic analysis of Al tolerance-associated gene families showed that most of these genes were conserved from streptophyte algae to angiosperms, indicating land plants have evolved gradually in adaption to Al-rich acid soil during plant terrestrialization. Vacuolar phosphate transporter SPX-major facility superfamily (SPX-MFS) and inorganic phosphate transporter 1 family (PHT1s) of streptophyte algae showed high genetic similarity to land plants.
