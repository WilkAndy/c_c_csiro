There is about 13% of global rice field on acidic soils (Vonuexkull and Mutert, 1995). Trivalent aluminum (Al3+) in acidic soils is harmful to root growth and reduces significantly rice yield (Liu et al., 2012). It is a major toxin for plants on acid soils (Delhaize et al., 2012). Therefore, exploring the genetic mechanism of Al tolerance in rice is of importance to understand why Al3+ is toxic to the plants and to breed Al tolerant varieties for rice production. Serval researches on the genetic mechanism of Al tolerance in rice have been reported (eg, Famoso et al., 2010, 2011; Cai et al., 2011). Previous researchers have identified a number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Al tolerance in rice (Nguyen et al., 2002; Ma and Furukawa, 2003; Mao et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2007; Famoso et al., 2011), and found a few genes linked to Al tolerance (eg, Yokosho et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014). In the context of QTL mapping for Al tolerance, most of these previous researches were conducted with bi-parent segregation populations and linkage mapping. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) make it possible to exploit natural genetic diversity and mine beneficial genes in the genome (Zhu et al., 2008). It is important to apply GWAS with modern genotyping technology for QTL mapping for Al tolerance.In recent years, many QTLs for multiple traits have been identified using GWAS. For example, Huang et al.(2010) conducted GWAS for 14 agronomic traits with high density SNP set and 517 indica landraces of rice. Using GWAS with a diverse rice set of 383 accessions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14169582625955511894", "cites_id": ["14169582625955511894"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VZqhDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:Vv6fG1N4pMQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=HUmTKK4S4J&sig=dIIvKc6CFwThmEqDgPgJwF6Ai0g", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vv6fG1N4pMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
