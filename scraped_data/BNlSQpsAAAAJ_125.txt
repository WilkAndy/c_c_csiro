The Leaf rust resistance 67 (Lr67) gene fits into the latter category as it confers partial resistance to multiple biotrophic fungal pathogens in wheat and encodes a Sugar Transport Protein 13 (STP13) family hexose-proton symporter variant. Two mutations (G144R, V387L) in the resistant variant, Lr67res, differentiate it from the susceptible Lr67sus variant. The molecular function of the Lr67res protein is not understood, and this study aimed to broaden our knowledge on this topic. Biophysical analysis of the wheat Lr67sus and Lr67res protein variants was performed using Xenopus laevis oocytes as a heterologous expression system. Oocytes injected with Lr67sus displayed properties typically associated with proton \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/192/2/1254/7049292", "cites_per_year": {}}
