Considering the pressures this will place on natural resources and urban infrastructure, no less than a transformation of our production systems is required for us to meet these challenges without gross social disruption and excessive environmental destruction (Food and Agriculture Organization 2022). This task alone is already difficult, but additional constraints discussed widely in the scientific literature and media (eg Food and Agriculture Organization 2022) make it even more daunting. The necessary leap in production needs to occur over a single generation, in a changing climate and while most countries attempt to completely change their energy supply to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero.Climate change will affect seasonal cycles, increase the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42729-023-01198-3", "cites_per_year": {}}
