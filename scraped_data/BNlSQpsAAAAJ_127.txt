At temperatures higher than the binder's glass transition temperature, fracture is caused predominantly by interface debonding between the binder and explosive crystals. Interfacial friction between debonded crystals can lead to accidental detonation of the PBX material, even under a very small external load. Cohesive zone laws can describe this interfacial debonding.This study aims to experimentally calibrate the interfacial cohesive zone parameters of a nitrocellulose based\u2013cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) PBX, a particulate composite with an 88% volume fraction of crystals.Compact tension fracture tests, coupled with Digital Image Correlation (DIC) were used to capture the strain fields around the crack tip. The experimental data were used in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11340-022-00895-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0HJrQLjl2u8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
