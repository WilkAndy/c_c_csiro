Among tested cations of a given charge, ameliorative effectiveness was similar except that Ca2+ was slightly more effective than other divalent cations and H+ was much more effective than other monovalent cations. H+ rhizotoxicity was also ameliorated by cations in the order C3+ > C2+ > C1+. These results suggest a role for cell-surface electrical potential in the rhizotoxicity of Al3+, La3+, H+, and other toxic cations: negatively charged cell surfaces of the root accumulate the toxic cations, and amelioration is effected by treatments that reduce the negativity of the cell-surface electrical potential by charge screening or cation binding.
