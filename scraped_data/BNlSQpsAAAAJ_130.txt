Yet the P fertilizers applied to crops and pastures are derived from non-renewable resources. It is therefore important to find agronomic and genetic strategies for using this resource efficiently, especially since only a proportion of the applied P is absorbed by crops. The aim of this study was to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for P use efficiency (PUE) in wheat using a Multiparent Advanced Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population grown in the field. The 357 genotypes were arranged in paired plots with and without P fertilization. Yield and biomass were measured and PUE was calculated as either the performance of the genotype relative to the average response to fertilization, or the performance of the genotype relative to the average resilience in the absence of fertilization. Five trials were conducted over three years in Australia at three sites with contrasting clay and sandy soil types.Genotypic variation for response and resilience were identified in all trials with moderate to strong correlation with productivity with and without P between trials. Multiparent Whole Genome Average Interval Mapping (WGAIM) QTL analyses were conducted on the four traits (Biomass / Yield \u00d7 P Response / Resilience) across the five trials and identified 130 QTL in total. QTL within 10 cM of each other were clustered into 56 groups that were likely to represent identical or linked loci. Of the clusters 27 (48%) contained only a single QTL but 17 (31%) contained 3 or more in different trials or traits. This suggests multiple biological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.271205.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CKIr5qIyRoMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
