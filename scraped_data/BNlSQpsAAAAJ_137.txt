Together, these two advancements remove the broad background signals endemic to FSRS measurements and retrieve signals with high sensitivity. We apply this frequency-modulated femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FM-FSRS) to the characterization of ultrafast energy transport in a copolymer comprised of polystyrene linked oligo(phenylene\u00e2    ethynylene) donor and thiophene\u00e2    benzothiadiazole acceptor chromophores. After photoexcitation of the donor, ultrafast energy transfer is monitored by the decay of donor vibrational modes and simultaneous growth of acceptor modes. The FM-FSRS method shows clear advantages in signal-to-noise levels, mitigation of artifact features, and ease of data processing over the conventional FSRS technique."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201700224969", "cites_per_year": {}}
