The rhizotoxicity of Al3+ is now accepted as the major limitation to plant production on acidic soils. Plants differ in their susceptibility to Al3+ in the rhizosphere, and significant variation can even occur within species, including some major crops. The physiology of Al3+ resistance in some species has been understood for 15 years [E. Delhaize, P.R. Ryan, P.J. Randall, Aluminum tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) II. Aluminum-stimulated excretion of malic acid from root apices. Plant Physiol. 103 (1993) 695\u2013702] but the molecular biology has been elucidated only more recently. The first gene controlling Al3+ resistance was cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004 but others have now been identified in Arabidopsis, barley (Hordeum vulgare), rye (Secale cereale) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945209002131", "cites_per_year": {}}
