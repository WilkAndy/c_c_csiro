The identification of novel alleles associated for Al resistance is required for further continual improvement. Besides, SNP and CEL 1 restriction enzyme based methods for EcoTILLING, gene specific markers based on INDELS and SSR could be utilised for preliminary genotyping and subsequently as a result of allele binning, unique haplotypes can be verified by sequencing. In order to validate this approach, we determined allelic diversity at the TaALMT1 locus in a wide range of 1425 germplasm collections that included wheat cultivars, landraces, T. aestivum ssp spelta, ssp. macha, ssp. sphaerococcum, ssp. compactum and ssp. vavilovii, and D genome containing accessions of Aegilops tauschii, A. cylindica and tetraploid and hexaploid A. crassa,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3393/P204.pdf?sequence=1", "cites_per_year": {}}
