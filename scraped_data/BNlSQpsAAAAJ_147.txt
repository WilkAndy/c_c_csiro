Nine cDNAs were isolated that enhanced the aluminum tolerance of yeast. These cDNAs were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and one cDNA from the roots of Stylosanthes hamata, designated S851, conferred greater aluminum tolerance to the transgenic seedlings. The protein predicted to be encoded by S851 showed an equally high similarity to \u03946 fatty acyl lipid desaturases and \u03948 sphingolipid desaturases. We expressed other known \u03946 desaturase and \u03948 desaturase genes in yeast and showed that a \u03946 fatty acyl desaturase from Echium plantagineum did not confer aluminum tolerance, whereas a \u03948 sphingobase desaturase from Arabidopsis did confer aluminum tolerance. Analysis of the fatty acids and sphingobases of the transgenic yeast and plant cells demonstrated that S851 encodes a \u03948 sphingobase desaturase, which leads to the accumulation of 8 (Z/E)-C18-phytosphingenine and 8 (Z/E)-C20-phytopshingenine in yeast and to the accumulation of 8 (Z/E)-C18-phytosphingenine in the leaves and roots of Arabidopsis plants. The newly formed 8 (Z/E)-C18-phytosphingenine in transgenic yeast accounted for 3 mol% of the total sphingobases with a 8 (Z): 8 (E)-isomer ratio of approximately 4: 1. The accumulation of 8 (Z)-C18-phytosphingenine in transgenic Arabidopsis shifted the ratio of the 8 (Z): 8 (E) isomers from 1: 4 in wild-type plants to 1: 1 in transgenic plants. These results indicate that S851 encodes the first \u03948 sphingolipid desaturase to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/69570645/1968.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qwlWIhXzbWcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
