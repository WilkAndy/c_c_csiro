TaALMT1 controls the Al-activated efflux of malate from roots, and this mechanism is widespread among Al-resistant genotypes of diverse genetic origins. This study describes a second mechanism for Al resistance in wheat that relies on citrate efflux. Citrate efflux occurred constitutively from the roots of Brazilian cultivars Carazinho, Maringa, Toropi, and Trintecinco. Examination of two populations segregating for this trait showed that citrate efflux was controlled by a single locus. Whole-genome linkage mapping using an F2 population derived from a cross between Carazinho (citrate efflux) and the cultivar EGA-Burke (no citrate efflux) identified a major locus on chromosome 4BL, Xcec, which accounts for more than 50% of the phenotypic variation in citrate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 342, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2136160624111230677", "cites_id": ["2136160624111230677"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/149/1/340/6107936", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1Z5TD8UqpR0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 24, "2011": 20, "2012": 28, "2013": 36, "2014": 29, "2015": 32, "2016": 29, "2017": 26, "2018": 26, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 29, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
