Unweathered rock from both areas contains 10\u201315% olivine; enstatite comprises 5\u20138% of peridotite at Santa Rosa and 20-25% of komatiite at Tortugal. Santa Rosa peridotite contains 55\u201360% serpentine; Tortugal komatiite contains 45% serpentine. Both areas receive approximately 1500 mm of annual precipitation. This study makes use sequential chemical extraction, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction to assess weathering products and trace metal speciation in soils derived from rocks with 100 mg/kg Co, 3000 mg/kg Cr and 2000 mg/kg Ni.Kaolinite/smectite and halloysite are the dominant clay minerals in A and B soil horizons on Santa Rosa. In the Tortugal region, Mg-rich trioctahedral smectite (saponite) is the main weathering product; K/S is also present but far less abundant. Additional weathering products include goethite, hematite and amorphous hydroxides and aluminosilicates. In both regions, serpentine persists during chemical weathering to the point that it is the dominant mineral in C horizons. Enstatite is locally present in B and C horizons but is absent from A horizons. Olivine is absent from all soils but is present in some weathering rinds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16224848618405388018&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
