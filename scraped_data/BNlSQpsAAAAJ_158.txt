Disadvantages of these chemical techniques are: They are not sensitive to variation of fluxes along the root or with time; they usually measure only one ion; they are often done on segments rather than intact roots.Ion selective microelectrodes can now be used to measure ion electrochemical gradients in solution very close to the surface of intact roots (1). Net ion fluxes are calculated from those gradients. This technique provides instantaneous flux measurements for a localised region of root cells. Fluxes of several ions can be measured together, and specific interaction between"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3101378973328880092&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3DEik75PCisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
