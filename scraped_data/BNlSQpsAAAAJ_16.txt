Proteoid root formation was greatest at Pi solution concentrations of 1\u201310 mmol m\u20133 and was suppressed at 25 mmol m\u20133 Pi and higher. Except at 1 mmol m\u20133 Pi, the formation of proteoid roots did not affect plant dry matter yields or shoot to root dry matter ratios, indicating that proteoid roots can form under conditions of adequate P supply and not at the expense of dry matter production. Plants with over 50% of the root system as proteoid roots had tissue P concentrations considered adequate for maximum growth, providing additional evidence that proteoid roots can form on P\u2010sufficient plants.
