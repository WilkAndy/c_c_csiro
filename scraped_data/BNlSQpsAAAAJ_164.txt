Plants expressing 35S:: GFP showed fluorescence within the nucleus and thin layer of cytoplasm. In young Arabidopsis root cap cells, 35S:: GFP fluorescence was detected within their their relatively large nuclei and cytoplasmic volume, whereas expression of ShMTP8: GFP outlined multiple small vacuoles that eventually coalesced to occupy most of the volume in older cells. In contrast, transient expression of either AtMTP11: GFP (GFP fused to C-terminus of AtMTP11) or GFP: AtMTP11 (GFP fused to N-terminus of AtMTP11) after bombardment into intact leek (Allium ampeloprasum) cells gave numerous motile fluorescent organelles which co-localised with the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) marker mRFP: AtVSR2 but which were largely distinct from the Golgi marker STtmd: DsRed [2]. After treatment with 20 \u00b5M wortmannin, AtMTP11: GFP-tagged organelles became less motile and many became vacuolated, similar to wortmannin-induced vacuolation of PVCs [3]. Brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi apparatus, did not affect these organelles.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at least two members of the CDF family, ShMTP8 and AtMTP11, confer Mn tolerance by sequestering Mn into internal organelles. The GFP-tagged ShMTP8 and AtMTP11 appear to be located in different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/47545157/297_Delhaize.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
