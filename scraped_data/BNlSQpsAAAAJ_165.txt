Current estimates suggest that approximately 50% of the world\u2019s arable land is acidic with 77-90 million hectares of topsoil in Australia alone currently acidic (Page et al. 2009). These estimates are predicted to increase in the future due to current farming practices leading to further soil acidification (Scott et al. 2000). While liming of acid soils is an effective ameliorant, it is not economically viable for farmers in developing countries or for ameliorating subsoil acidity (Kochian et al. 2004)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8729636131668508968&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KEGEZs_lJXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
