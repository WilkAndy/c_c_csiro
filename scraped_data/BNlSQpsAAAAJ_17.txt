One of the major limitations to plant growth on acid soils is the prevalence of soluble aluminium (Al3+) ions which can inhibit root growth at micromolar concentrations. Species that show a natural resistance to Al3+ toxicity perform better on acid soils. Our understanding of the physiology of Al3+ resistance in important crop plants has increased greatly over the past 20 years, largely due to the application of genetics and molecular biology. Fourteen genes from seven different species are known to contribute to Al3+ tolerance and resistance and several additional candidates have been identified. Some of these genes account for genotypic variation within species and others do not. One mechanism of resistance which has now been identified in a range of species relies on the efflux of organic anions such as malate and citrate from roots. The genes controlling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 336, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7591072027957637518", "cites_id": ["7591072027957637518"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/62/1/9/512632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jrHRSsrnWGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 11, "2012": 24, "2013": 34, "2014": 27, "2015": 37, "2016": 31, "2017": 29, "2018": 29, "2019": 22, "2020": 25, "2021": 32, "2022": 21, "2023": 11}}
