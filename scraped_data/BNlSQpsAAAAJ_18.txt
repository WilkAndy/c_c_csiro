This response has been implicated in a mechanism of Al tolerance since the amount of malate released from an Al-tolerant genotype was 5-10-fold greater than the amount released from a near-isogenic, but Al sensitive, genotype. In the present study, 36 wheat cultivars were screened for Al tolerance and for the amount of malate released from their root apices with a standard A1 treatment. Excised root apices (3.0 mm) were used to measure malate efflux, and the relative tolerance to Al was determined from root growth measurements in 3 and 10\u03bcM AlCl3 with 200 \u03bcM CaCl2, pH 4.3. There was a significant correlation between relative tolerance of the genotypes to Al and the amount of malate released from their root apices. Growth measurements were also used to investigate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 327, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=58651091250127518", "cites_id": ["58651091250127518"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9950531", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:niKnU9te0AAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 5, "1997": 16, "1998": 11, "1999": 4, "2000": 13, "2001": 27, "2002": 17, "2003": 22, "2004": 14, "2005": 20, "2006": 20, "2007": 21, "2008": 8, "2009": 14, "2010": 12, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 20, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
