In this critical zone, plants perceive and respond to their environment. As a consequence of normal growth and development, a large range of organic and inorganic substances are exchanged between the root and soil, which inevitably leads to changes in the biochemical and physical properties of the rhizosphere. Plants also modify their rhizosphere in response to certain environmental signals and stresses. Organic anions are commonly detected in this region, and their exudation from plant roots has now been associated with nutrient deficiencies and inorganic ion stresses. This review summarizes recent developments in the understanding of the function, mechanism, and regulation of organic anion exudation from roots. The benefits that plants derive from the presence of organic anions in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 1688, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9600938997501253620", "cites_id": ["9600938997501253620"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.52.1.527", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9NdBeCZjPYUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 23, "2003": 50, "2004": 41, "2005": 75, "2006": 67, "2007": 74, "2008": 86, "2009": 57, "2010": 83, "2011": 76, "2012": 71, "2013": 110, "2014": 108, "2015": 80, "2016": 96, "2017": 104, "2018": 94, "2019": 68, "2020": 86, "2021": 106, "2022": 79, "2023": 32}}
