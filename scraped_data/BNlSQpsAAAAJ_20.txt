Plants have evolved mechanisms to tolerate Al3+ and one type of mechanism relies on the efflux of organic anions that protect roots by chelating the Al3+. Al3+ resistance genes of several species have now been isolated and found to encode membrane proteins that facilitate organic anion efflux from roots. These proteins belong to the Al3+-activated malate transporter (ALMT) and multi-drug and toxin extrusion (MATE) families. We review the roles of these proteins in Al3+ resistance as well as their roles in other aspects of mineral nutrition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 304, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1570592237993263977", "cites_id": ["1570592237993263977"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579307003110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aQOTsFHdyxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 11, "2009": 20, "2010": 24, "2011": 26, "2012": 26, "2013": 24, "2014": 20, "2015": 21, "2016": 24, "2017": 15, "2018": 23, "2019": 15, "2020": 21, "2021": 17, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
