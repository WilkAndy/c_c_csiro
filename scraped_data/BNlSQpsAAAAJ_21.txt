Some strategies directly target plant processes that impact on growth, while others are based on our knowledge of interactions among the components of the rhizosphere (roots, microorganisms and soil). For instance, plants can be engineered to modify the rhizosphere pH or to release compounds that improve nutrient availability, protect against biotic and abiotic stresses, or encourage the proliferation of beneficial microorganisms. Rhizobacteria that promote plant growth have been engineered to interfere with the synthesis of stress-induced hormones such as ethylene, which retards root growth, and to produce antibiotics and lytic enzymes active against soilborne root pathogens. Rhizosphere engineering also can involve the selection by plants of beneficial microbial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 302, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9684243066628395003", "cites_id": ["9684243066628395003"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-009-0001-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-8_sgMJXZYYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 7, "2011": 15, "2012": 20, "2013": 24, "2014": 22, "2015": 19, "2016": 16, "2017": 21, "2018": 17, "2019": 23, "2020": 23, "2021": 40, "2022": 42, "2023": 8}}
