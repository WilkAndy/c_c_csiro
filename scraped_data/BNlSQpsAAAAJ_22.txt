In the whole-cell configuration, addition of 20\u201350 \u03bcM AlCl3 to the external solution depolarized the membrane and activated an inward current that could remain active for more than 60 min. The activation by Al3+ was rapid in 20% of protoplasts examined, whereas in another 30% a delay of more than 10 min occurred after Al3+ was added. Once the current was activated, changing the external Cl\u2212 concentration shifted the membrane reversal potential with ECl, showing that the channel is more selective for anions than cations (Ca2+, K+, tetraethylammonium+). The channel could be activated by Al3+, but not by La3+, and was observed in protoplasts isolated from the root apex but not in protoplasts isolated from mature root tissue.
