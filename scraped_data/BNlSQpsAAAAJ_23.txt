Four of the 11 proteins in the family form a distinct cluster on a phylogenetic tree and are closely related to ShMTP8, a CDF identified in the tropical legume Stylosanthes hamata that is implicated in the transport of Mn2+ into the vacuole as a tolerance mechanism. Of these four genes, AtMTP11 was the most highly expressed member of the Arabidopsis subgroup. When AtMTP11 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it conferred Mn2+ tolerance and transported Mn2+ by a proton\u2010antiport mechanism. A mutant of Arabidopsis with a disrupted AtMTP11 gene (mtp11) was found to have increased sensitivity to Mn2+ but not to Cu2+ or Zn2+. At a non\u2010toxic but sufficient Mn2+ supply (basal), the mutant accumulated more Mn2+ than the wild type, but did not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 279, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12984294826219923348", "cites_id": ["12984294826219923348"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03138.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lOfHx1l7MbQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 11, "2010": 13, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 16, "2014": 26, "2015": 16, "2016": 17, "2017": 23, "2018": 22, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 36, "2022": 32, "2023": 12}}
