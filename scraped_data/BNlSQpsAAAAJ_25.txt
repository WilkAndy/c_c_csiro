Our previous findings showed that Al treatment induced malate and citrate efflux from rape (Brassica napus) roots, and that P deficiency did not induce the efflux. Since this response is similar to the malate efflux from wheat (Triticum aestivum) that is controlled by the TaALMT1 gene, we investigated whether homologs of TaALMT1 are present in rape and whether they are involved in the release of organic anions. We isolated two TaALMT1 homologs from rape designated BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 (B. napus Al-activated malate transporter). The expression of these genes was induced in roots, but not shoots, by Al treatment but P deficiency had no effect. Several other cations (lanthanum, ytterbium, and erbium) also increased BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 expression in the roots \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 253, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=702366119748565947", "cites_id": ["702366119748565947"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/142/3/1294/6106359", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u_vhvUNOvwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 10, "2008": 5, "2009": 16, "2010": 18, "2011": 18, "2012": 15, "2013": 31, "2014": 17, "2015": 15, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 13, "2020": 16, "2021": 21, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
