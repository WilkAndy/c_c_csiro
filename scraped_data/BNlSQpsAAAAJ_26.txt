Previous work reported that expression of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa citrate synthase gene in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum; CSb lines) resulted in improved Al tolerance (J.M. de la Fuente, V. Ram\u0131\u0301rez-Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, J.L. Cabrera-Ponce, L. Herrera-Estrella [1997] Science 276: 1566\u20131568) and an enhanced ability to acquire P from alkaline soils (J. Lo\u0301pez-Bucio, O. Mart\u0131\u0301nez de la Vega, A. Guevara-Garc\u0131\u0301a, L. Herrera-Estrella [2000] Nat Biotechnol 18: 450\u2013453). These effects were attributed to the P. aeruginosa citrate synthase increasing the biosynthesis and efflux of citrate from roots. To verify these findings we: (a) characterized citrate efflux from roots of wild-type tobacco; (b) generated tobacco lines expressing the citrate synthase gene from P. aeruginosa; and (c) analyzed selected CSb lines \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 253, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1768430439339476350", "cites_id": ["1768430439339476350"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/125/4/2059/6097801", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fkXRch26ihgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 9, "2002": 13, "2003": 14, "2004": 19, "2005": 22, "2006": 16, "2007": 15, "2008": 13, "2009": 20, "2010": 15, "2011": 10, "2012": 13, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
