The malate anions protect the sensitive root tips by chelating the toxic Al3+ cations in the rhizosphere to form non-toxic complexes. Activation of malate-permeable channels in the plasma membrane could be critical in regulating this malate efflux. We examined this by investigating Al3+-activated channels in protoplasts from root apices of near-isogenic wheat differing in Al3+ tolerance at a single locus. Using whole-cell patch clamp we found that Al3+stimulated an electrical current carried by anion efflux across the plasma membrane in the Al3+-tolerant (ET8) and Al3+-sensitive (ES8) genotypes. This current occurred more frequently, had a greater current density, and remained active for longer in ET8 protoplasts than for ES8 protoplasts. The Al3+-activated current exhibited higher \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 241, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13620614500122680319", "cites_id": ["13620614500122680319"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/125/3/1459/6109963", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_9tYBrkkBr0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 8, "2002": 11, "2003": 16, "2004": 15, "2005": 27, "2006": 16, "2007": 20, "2008": 16, "2009": 7, "2010": 14, "2011": 11, "2012": 8, "2013": 16, "2014": 11, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
