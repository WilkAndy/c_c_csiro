There is substantial interest in breeding and managing crops that host root microbial communities that increase productivity. The eudicot model species Arabidopsis has been used to investigate these processes, however a model for monocotyledons is also required. We characterized the rhizosphere microbiome and root exudates of Brachypodium distachyon, to develop it as a rhizosphere model for cereal species like wheat. The Brachypodium rhizosphere microbial community was dominated by Burkholderiales. However, these communities were also dependent on how tightly they were bound to roots, the root type they were associated with (nodal or seminal roots), and their location along the roots. Moreover, the functional gene categories detected in microorganisms isolated from around root tips differed from those isolated from bases of roots. The Brachypodium rhizosphere microbiota and root exudate profiles were similar to those reported for wheat rhizospheres, and different to Arabidopsis. The differences in root system development and cell wall chemistry between monocotyledons and eudicots may also influence the microorganism composition of these major plant types. Brachypodium is a promising model for investigating the microbiome of wheat."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 213, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2139083514579702743", "cites_id": ["2139083514579702743"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164533", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:19Nqhx-Nrx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 9, "2018": 19, "2019": 25, "2020": 41, "2021": 51, "2022": 46, "2023": 20}}
