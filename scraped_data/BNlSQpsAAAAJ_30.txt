Plants use a variety of sequestration and transport mechanisms to move and export bioactive products safely into the rhizosphere. The use of mutants and molecular tools to study gene expression has revealed new information regarding the diverse group of transport proteins and conjugation processes employed by higher plants. Transport systems used for moving secondary products into and out of root cells are similar to those used elsewhere in the plant but are closely linked to soil environmental conditions and local root health. Root cells can rapidly generate and release large quantities of allelochemicals in response to stress or local rhizosphere conditions, so the production and transport of these compounds in cells are often closely linked.
