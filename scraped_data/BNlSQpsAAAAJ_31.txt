In short\u2010term pot trials (26 days), transgenic barley expressing TaALMT1 (GP\u2010ALMT1) was more efficient than a non\u2010transformed sibling line (GP) at taking up phosphorus on acid soil, but the genotypes did not differ when the soil was limed. Differences in phosphorus uptake efficiency on acid soil could be attributed not only to the differential effects of aluminium toxicity on root growth between the genotypes, but also to differences in phosphorus uptake per unit root length. Although GP\u2010ALMT1 out\u2010performed GP on acid soil, it was still not as efficient at taking up phosphorus as plants grown on limed soil.
