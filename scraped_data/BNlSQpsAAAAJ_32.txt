Genomic regions upstream and downstream of              ALMT1              in 69 wheat lines were characterized to identify patterns that might influence              ALMT1              expression. The first 1,000\u2009bp downstream of              ALMT1              was conserved among the lines examined apart from the presence of a transposon-like sequence which did not correlate with Al resistance. In contrast, the first 1,000\u2009bp upstream of the              ALMT1              coding region was more variable and six different patterns could be discerned (types I\u2013VI). Type I had the simplest structure, while the others had blocks of sequence that were duplicated or triplicated in different arrangements.
