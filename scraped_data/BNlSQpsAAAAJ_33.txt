The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Disruption of calcium (Ca) uptake by Al has long been considered a possible cause of toxicity, and recent work with wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Thell) has demonstrated that Ca uptake at the root apex in an Al-sensitive cultivar (Scout 66) was inhibited more than in a tolerant cultivar (Atlas 66) (J.W. Huang, J.E. Shaff, D.L. Grunes, L.V. Kochian [1992] Plant Physiol 98: 230\u2013)237). We investigated this interaction further in wheat by measuring root growth and Ca uptake in three separate pairs of near-isogenic lines within which plants exhibit differential sensitivity to Al. The vibrating calcium-selective microelectrode technique was used to estimate net Ca uptake at the root apex of 6-d-old seedlings.
