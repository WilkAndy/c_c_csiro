The rhizotoxicity of Al3+ is now accepted as the major limitation to plant production on acidic soils. Plants differ in their susceptibility to Al3+ toxicity and significant variation can occur within species, even in some major crops. The physiology of Al3+ resistance in some species has been understood for 15 years but the molecular biology has been elucidated only recently. The first gene controlling Al3+ resistance was cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004 but others have now been identified in Arabidopsis, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolour (L.) Moench) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) with strong additional candidates in wheat and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). These genes confer resistance in different ways, but one mechanism occurs in nearly all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=806590856580655830", "cites_id": ["806590856580655830"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/fp09261", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1mqRTRyWMQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 17, "2014": 12, "2015": 18, "2016": 14, "2017": 16, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
