TaMATE1B expression in roots was induced by iron deficiency but not by phosphorus deficiency or aluminum treatment. The coding region of TaMATE1B was identical in a genotype showing citrate efflux from root apices (cv Carazinho) to one that lacked citrate efflux (cv Egret). However, sequence upstream of the coding region differed between these two genotypes in two ways. The first difference was a single-nucleotide polymorphism located approximately 2 kb upstream from the start codon in cv Egret. The second difference was an 11.1-kb transposon-like element located 25 bp upstream of the start codon in cv Carazinho that was absent from cv Egret. The influence of these polymorphisms on TaMATE1B \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14880230063463349806", "cites_id": ["14880230063463349806"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/161/2/880/6110798", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Lj7SZGcygc4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 19, "2015": 14, "2016": 13, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 20, "2020": 15, "2021": 17, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
