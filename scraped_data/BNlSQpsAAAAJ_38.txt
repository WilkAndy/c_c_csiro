The inhibition of Ca2+ uptake in roots by Al3+ has been proposed as a possible mechanism for Al3+ toxicity, and in this study the hypothesis was tested directly. Root growth and Ca2+ uptake were measured in 5-d-old seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Thell) during exposure to Al3+ in a low-Ca2+ basal medium, and to Al3+ in the presence of added cations. Uptake of Ca2+ in whole roots and translocation to the shoot were measured using 45Ca2+, and localized measurements of net Ca2+ flux were also made at the root apex using the technique of microelectrode ion-flux estimation. Treatment with 2.64 \u03bcM AlCl3 in 226 \u03bcM CaCl2, at pH 4.5, severely inhibited root growth without affecting Ca2+ uptake. Addition of 30 mM Na2+, 3 mM Mg2+ or 50 \u03bcM tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10648373971888306296", "cites_id": ["10648373971888306296"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00198698", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ePjqvbWfxpMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 14, "1996": 8, "1997": 8, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 12, "2002": 7, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
