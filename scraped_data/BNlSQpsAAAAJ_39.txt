The cDNA was isolated on its ability to confer increased resistance to aluminum toxicity when expressed in yeast. The sequence of the predicted protein encoded byTaPSS1 shows homology to PSS from both yeast and bacteria but is distinct from the animal PSS enzymes that catalyze base-exchange reactions. In wheat, Southern blot analysis identified the presence of a small family of genes that cross-hybridized to TaPSS1,and Northern blots showed that aluminum induced TaPSS1expression in root apices. Expression of TaPSS1complemented the yeast cho1 mutant that lacks PSS activity and altered the phospholipid composition of wild type yeast, with the most marked effect being increased abundance of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=851711305453857262", "cites_id": ["851711305453857262"], "pub_url": "https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)36976-X/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7unCdOvi0QsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 6, "2001": 9, "2002": 5, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 9, "2007": 10, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4}}
