Addition of Al to nutrient solutions stimulated excretion of malic and succinic acids from roots of wheat seedlings, and Al-tolerant genotypes excreted 5- to 10-fold more malic acid than Al-sensitive genotypes. Malic acid excretion was detectable after 15 min of exposure to 200 [mu]M Al, and the amount excreted increased linearly over 24 h. The amount of malic acid excreted was dependent on the external Al concentration, and excretion was stimulated by as little as 10 [mu]M Al. Malic acid added to nutrient solutions was able to protect Al-sensitive seedlings from normally phytotoxic Al concentrations. Root apices (terminal 3\u20135 mm of root) were the primary source of the malic acid excreted.
