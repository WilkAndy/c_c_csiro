Despite the well-documented role of root hairs in phosphate uptake, their role in water extraction is controversial.We grew barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Pallas) and its root-hairless mutant brb in a root pressure chamber, whereby the transpiration rate could be varied whilst monitoring the suction in the xylem. The method provides accurate measurements of the dynamic relationship between the transpiration rate and xylem suction.The relationship between the transpiration rate and xylem suction was linear in wet soils and did not differ between genotypes. When the soil dried, the xylem suction increased rapidly and non-linearly at high transpiration rates. This response was much greater with the brb mutant, implying a reduced capacity to take up water.We conclude that root hairs facilitate the uptake of water by substantially reducing the drop in matric potential at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1134808830697459074", "cites_id": ["1134808830697459074"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/90015071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gs2yeZ6mvw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 22, "2021": 30, "2022": 39, "2023": 7}}
