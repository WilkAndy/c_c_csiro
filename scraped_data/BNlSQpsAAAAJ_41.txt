Evaluating the Ca2+-displacement hypothesis", "pub_year": 1993, "citation": "Planta 192, 104-109, 1993", "author": "Thomas B Kinraide and Peter R Ryan and Leon V Kochian", "journal": "Planta", "volume": "192", "pages": "104-109", "publisher": "Springer-Verlag", "abstract": "Several mineral rhizotoxicities, including those induced by Al3+, H+, and Na+, can be relieved by elevated Ca2+ in the rooting medium. This leads to the hypothesis that the toxic cations displace Ca2+ from transport channels or surface ligands that must be occupied by Ca2+ in order for root elongation to occur. In this study with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings, we have determined, in the case of Al3+, that (i) Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ are equally ameliorative, (ii) that root elongation does not increase as Ca2+ replaces Mg2+ or Sr2+ in the rooting media, and (iii) that rhizotoxicity is a function solely of Al3+ activity at the root-cell membrane surface as computed by a Gouy-Chapman-Stern model. The rhizotoxicity was indifferent to the computed membrane-surface Ca2+ activity. The rhizotoxicity induced by high levels of tris(ethylenediamine)cobaltic ion (TEC3+), in contrast to Al3+, was specifically relieved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10005255821775773992", "cites_id": ["10005255821775773992"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00198699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KKHa5yjP2YoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 14, "1996": 9, "1997": 10, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 9, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
