These challenges will only be met by increasing the land under cultivation and by improving the yields obtained on existing farms. Genetic engineering can target key traits to improve crop yields and to increase production on marginal soils. Soil acidity is a major abiotic stress that limits plant production worldwide. The goal of this study was to enhance the acid soil tolerance of wheat by increasing its resistance to Al3+ toxicity.Particle bombardment was used to transform wheat with TaALMT1, the Al3+ resistance gene from wheat, using the maize ubiquitin promoter to drive expression. TaALMT1 expression, malate efflux and Al3+ resistance were measured in the T1 and T2 lines and compared with the parental line and an Al3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5985844397303089081", "cites_id": ["5985844397303089081"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/106/1/205/94864", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uUcD1sP9EVMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 18, "2013": 15, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
