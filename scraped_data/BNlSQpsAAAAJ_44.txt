Major food crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have evolved mechanisms to resist Al3+ toxicity, thus enabling wider distribution. The origins of Al3+ resistance in wheat are perplexing because all progenitors of this hexaploid species are reportedly sensitive to Al3+ stress. The large genotypic variation for Al3+ resistance in wheat is largely controlled by expression of an anion channel, TaALMT1, which releases malate anions from the root apices. A current hypothesis proposes that the malate anions protect this sensitive growth zone by binding to Al3+ in the apoplasm. We investigated the evolution of this trait in wheat, and demonstrated that it has multiple independent origins that enhance Al3+ resistance by increasing TaALMT1 expression. One origin is likely to be Aegilops \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11320104744323868841", "cites_id": ["11320104744323868841"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04338.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qWij2UkXGZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 14, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
