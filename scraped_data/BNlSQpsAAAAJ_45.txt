Backcrossed populations were generated from cv Fronteira (large rhizosheath) using cv EGA\u2010Burke (small rhizosheath) as the recurrent parent.  \u2022 A positive correlation existed between rhizosheath size on acid soil and root hair length. In hydroponic experiments, root hairs of the backcrossed lines with large rhizosheaths were more tolerant of Al3+ toxicity than the backcrossed lines with small rhizosheaths.  \u2022 We conclude that greater Al3+ tolerance of root hairs underlies the larger rhizosheath of wheat grown on acid soil.
