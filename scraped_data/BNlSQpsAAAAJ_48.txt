Nine cDNAs were isolated that enhanced the aluminum tolerance of yeast. These cDNAs were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and one cDNA from the roots of Stylosanthes hamata, designated S851, conferred greater aluminum tolerance to the transgenic seedlings. The protein predicted to be encoded by S851 showed an equally high similarity to \u03946 fatty acyl lipid desaturases and \u03948 sphingolipid desaturases. We expressed other known \u03946 desaturase and \u03948 desaturase genes in yeast and showed that a \u03946 fatty acyl desaturase from Echium plantagineum did not confer aluminum tolerance, whereas a \u03948 sphingobase desaturase from Arabidopsis did confer aluminum tolerance.
