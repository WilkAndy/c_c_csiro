Substantial genetic variation in tolerance occurs among genotypes of barley, so the development of salt-tolerant cultivars is a potentially effective approach for minimizing yield losses. The lack of economically viable methods for screening salinity tolerance in the field remains an obstacle to breeders, and molecular marker-assisted selection is a promising alternative. In this study, salinity tolerance of 172 doubled-haploid lines generated from YYXT (salinity-tolerant) and Franklin (salinity-sensitive) was assessed in glasshouse trials during the vegetative phase. A high-density genetic linkage map was constructed from 76 pairs of simple sequence repeats and 782 Diversity Arrays Technology markers which spanned a total of 1,147 cM. Five significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for salinity tolerance were identified on chromosomes 1H, 2H, 5H, 6H and 7H \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17492489715107881233", "cites_id": ["17492489715107881233"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11032-011-9559-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EeEterfOwfIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 16, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
