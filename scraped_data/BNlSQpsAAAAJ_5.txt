The enhanced Al tolerance exhibited by some cultivars of wheat is associated with the Al\u2010dependent efflux of malate from root apices. Malate forms a stable complex with Al that is harmless to plants and, therefore, this efflux of malate forms the basis of a hypothesis to explain Al tolerance in wheat. Here, we report on the cloning of a wheat gene, ALMT1 (aluminum\u2010activated malate transporter), that co\u2010segregates with Al tolerance in F2 and F3 populations derived from crosses between near\u2010isogenic wheat lines that differ in Al tolerance. The ALMT1 gene encodes a membrane protein, which is constitutively expressed in the root apices of the Al\u2010tolerant line at greater levels than in the near\u2010isogenic but Al\u2010sensitive line.
