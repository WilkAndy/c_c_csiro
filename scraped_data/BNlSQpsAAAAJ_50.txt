Expression of the AtAMT1;1 gene in Arabidopsis roots increased approximately four-fold in response to nitrogen deprivation. This coincided with a similar increase in high-affinity ammonium uptake by these plants. The biophysical characteristics of this high-affinity system (Km for ammonium and methylammonium of 8 \u03bcM and 31 \u03bcM, respectively) matched those of AtAMT1;1 expressed in yeast (Km for methylammonium of 32 \u03bcM and Ki for ammonium of 1\u201310 \u03bcM). The same transport system was present, although less active, in nitrate-fed roots. Ammonium-fed plants exhibited the lowest rates of ammonium uptake and appeared to deploy a different transporter (Km for ammonium of 46 \u03bcM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3480054509322281461", "cites_id": ["3480054509322281461"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010303813181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9aEmWyOjSzAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 12, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
