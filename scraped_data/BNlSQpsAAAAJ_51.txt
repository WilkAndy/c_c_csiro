Transgenic lines overexpressing OsAMT1-1 were produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of two rice cultivars, Taipei 309 and Jarrah, with an OsAMT1-1 cDNA gene construct driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter. Transcript levels of OsAMT1-1 in both Taipei 309 and Jarrah transgenic lines correlated positively with transgene copy number. Shoot and root biomass of some transgenic lines decreased during seedling and early vegetative stage compared to the wild type, especially when grown under high (2\u2009mm) ammonium nutrition. Transgenic plants, particularly those of cv. Jarrah recovered in the mid-vegetative stage under high ammonium nutrition. Roots of the transgenic plants showed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15559463946182810978", "cites_id": ["15559463946182810978"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/FP05165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yl25fwVS7tcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
