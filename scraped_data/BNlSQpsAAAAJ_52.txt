We expressed TaALMT1 in Nicotiana tabacum L. suspension cells and conducted a detailed functional analysis. Protoplasts were isolated for patch-clamping from cells expressing TaALMT1 and from control cells (empty vector transformed). With malate2\u2013 as the permeant anion in the protoplast, an inward current (anion efflux) that reversed at positive potentials was observed in protoplasts expressing TaALMT1 in the absence of Al3+. This current was sensitive to the anion channel antagonist niflumate, but insensitive to Gd3+. External AlCl3 (50 \u03bcM), but not La3+ and Gd3+, increased the inward current in TaALMT1-transformed protoplasts. The inward current was highly selective to malate over nitrate and chloride (Pmal >> PNO3 \u2265 PCl, Pmal/PCl \u226518, +/\u2013Al3+), under conditions with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4997223113086726475", "cites_id": ["4997223113086726475"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/49/9/1316/1885012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S_Hn5vGzWUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 11, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
