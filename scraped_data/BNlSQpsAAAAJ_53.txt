These anions are widely suggested to enhance the availability of phosphate for plant uptake by mobilizing sparingly\u2010soluble forms in the soil. Carazinho is an old wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar from Brazil, which secretes citrate constitutively from its root apices, and here we show that it also produces relatively more biomass on soils with low P availability than two recent Australian cultivars that lack citrate efflux. To test whether citrate efflux explains this phenotype, we generated two sets of near\u2010isogenic lines that differ in citrate efflux and compared their biomass production in different soil types and with different P treatments in glasshouse experiments and field trials. Citrate efflux improved relative biomass production in two of six glasshouse trials but only at the lowest P treatments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10420327562508035062", "cites_id": ["10420327562508035062"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ppl.12150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9uOAdrVwnJAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 16, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
