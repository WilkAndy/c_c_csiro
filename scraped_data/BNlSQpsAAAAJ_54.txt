We evaluated the Ca2+-displacement hypothesis directly using near-isogenic lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that differ in Al tolerance at a single locus. We measured both the growth and total accumulation (apoplasmic plus symplasmic) of 45Ca and Al into roots that had been exposed to Al alone or to Al with other cations. Root growth in the Al-sensitive line was found to be severely inhibited by low activities of Al, even though Ca2+ accumulation was relatively unaffected. In solutions containing the same activity of the Al3+ and Ca2+ ions as above, but also including either 3.0 mM Mg2+, 3.0 mM Sr2+, or 30 mM Na+, growth improved, whereas 45Ca2+ accumulation was significantly decreased. Since most of the 45Ca2+ accumulated by roots during short-term treatments will reside in the apoplasm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8807799830696470468", "cites_id": ["8807799830696470468"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/113/4/1351/6070969", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xKdowUeXO3oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 10, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 5, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
