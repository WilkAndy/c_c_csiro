Continued gains will be obtained by identifying superior alleles and novel Al3+ resistance loci that can be incorporated into breeding programs. We used association mapping to identify genomic regions associated with Al3+ resistance using 1055 accessions of common wheat from different geographic regions of the world and 178 polymorphic diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers. Bayesian analyses based on genetic distance matrices classified these accessions into 12 subgroups. Genome-wide association analyses detected markers that were significantly associated with Al3+ resistance on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B. Some of these genomic regions correspond to previously identified loci for Al3+ resistance, whereas others \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6114268466809513159", "cites_id": ["6114268466809513159"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/G10-058", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x6SNmcY-2lQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
