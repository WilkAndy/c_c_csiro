To determine the mechanism underlying citrate release from cluster roots, we isolated protoplasts from different types of roots of white lupin plants grown in phosphorus-replete (+P) and phosphorus-deficient (\u2212P) conditions and used the patch-clamp technique to measure the whole-cell currents flowing across plasma membrane of these protoplasts. Two main types of anion conductance were observed in protoplasts prepared from cluster root tissue: (1) an inwardly rectifying anion conductance (IRAC) activated by membrane hyperpolarization, and (2) an outwardly rectifying anion conductance (ORAC) that became more activated with membrane depolarization. Although ORAC was an outward rectifier, it did \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8511087016464308168", "cites_id": ["8511087016464308168"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/136/3/3771/6112491", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yFfLPIx0HXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 7, "2011": 12, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
