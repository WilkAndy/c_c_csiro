Fifteen hexaploid bread wheats were then examined more closely for early biomass production on 2 low-P soils: a highly P-fixing Ferrosol (1.3\u2009mg resin-extractable P/kg) and a Red Kandosol (5.2\u2009mg resin-extractable P/kg). The soils were either unamended for P or supplemented with sufficient P for maximum growth. Single lines of rye, triticale, and durum wheat were included for comparison. The plants were harvested at 21 and 35 DAS, and shoot biomass, root biomass, P content, and root length were measured. Shoot biomass was correlated with the P content of the seed in both unamended soils at the first harvest but only in the Ferrosol at the second harvest. There were no correlations between seed P and shoot \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15424908277608145600", "cites_id": ["15424908277608145600"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar06311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wOLQk1pIENYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 3, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 6}}
