Citrate efflux is facilitated by members of the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound exudation) family localized to the plasma membrane of root cells. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is among the most Al3+-sensitive cereal species but the small genotypic variation in tolerance that is present is correlated with citrate efflux via a MATE transporter named HvAACT1. This study used a biotechnological approach to increase the Al3+ tolerance of barley by transforming it with two MATE genes that encode citrate transporters: SbMATE is the major Al3+-tolerance gene from sorghum whereas FRD3 is involved with Fe nutrition in Arabidopsis. Independent transgenic and null T3 lines were generated for both transgenes. Lines expressing SbMATE showed Al3+-activated citrate efflux from root apices and greater tolerance to Al3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15061217788632888761", "cites_id": ["15061217788632888761"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/65/9/2381/522849", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ufVB8McxBNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 12, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 9}}
