This Special Issue presents a collection of papers that address topics at the forefront of our understanding of root biology. Scope These papers investigate how roots cope with drought, nutrient deficiencies, toxicities and soil compaction as well as the interactions that roots have with soil microorganisms. Roots of model plant species, annual crops and perennial species are studied in short-term experiments through to multi-year trials. Spatial scales range from the gene up to farming systems and nutrient cycling. The diverse, integrated approaches described by these studies encompass root genetics as applied to soil management, as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5756495939003630674", "cites_id": ["5756495939003630674"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/118/4/555/2196647", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UkRKq44u408J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 13, "2021": 20, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
