In developing countries, which have limited access to P fertiliser, there is a need to develop plants that are more efficient at low soil P. In fertilised and intensive systems, P-efficient plants are required to minimise inefficient use of P-inputs and to reduce potential for loss of P to the environment.Three strategies by which plants and microorganisms may improve P-use efficiency are outlined: (i) Root-foraging strategies that improve P acquisition by lowering the critical P requirement of plant growth and allowing agriculture to operate at lower levels of soil P; (ii) P-mining strategies to enhance the desorption, solubilisation or mineralisation of P from sparingly-available sources in soil using root exudates (organic anions, phosphatases), and (iii) improving internal P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 836, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12912768690257553651", "cites_id": ["12912768690257553651"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-011-0950-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:82iWgbVeM7MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 18, "2013": 53, "2014": 65, "2015": 64, "2016": 74, "2017": 84, "2018": 84, "2019": 77, "2020": 72, "2021": 102, "2022": 86, "2023": 49}}
