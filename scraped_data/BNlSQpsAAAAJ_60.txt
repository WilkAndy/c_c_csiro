Expression of TaALMT1 in Xenopus oocytes and tobacco suspension cells enhances the basal transport activity (inward and outward currents present in the absence of external Al3+), and generates the same Al3+\u2010activated currents (reflecting the Al3+\u2010dependent transport function) as observed in wheat cells. We investigated the amino acid residues involved in this Al3+\u2010dependent transport activity by generating a series of mutations to the TaALMT1 protein. We targeted the acidic residues on the hydrophilic C\u2010terminal domain of TaALMT1 and changed them to uncharged residues by site\u2010directed mutagenesis. These mutant proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their transport activity was measured before \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1249398804364409617", "cites_id": ["1249398804364409617"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04309.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ETvwzJfBVhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 6}}
