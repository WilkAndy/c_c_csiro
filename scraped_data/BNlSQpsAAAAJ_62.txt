The present study supports this role for ALR1 and provides the first electrophysiological characterisation of this protein. The patch-clamp technique was used to measure whole-cell ion currents in protoplasts prepared from the wild-type strain, the alr1 alr2 double mutant (CM66), and the double mutant over-expressing the ALR1 gene (CM66+ALR1). With 50 mM Mg2+ in the bathing solution, the inward current in protoplasts of CM66+ALR1 averaged \u2212264\u00b148 pA at \u2212150 mV. Inward currents measured in the wild-type and CM66 protoplasts were more than five-fold smaller. When Mg2+ was the major cation in the pipette solution, time-dependent outward currents were also detected in CM66+ALR1 protoplasts suggesting ALR1 can facilitate Mg2+ efflux as well as uptake. We conclude that the ALR1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4857973474803293097", "cites_id": ["4857973474803293097"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article-abstract/213/2/231/590375", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qZvr_SL9akMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
