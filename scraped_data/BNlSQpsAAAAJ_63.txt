The theory, sensitivity, time and space resolution, and limitations of this non-invasive technique to measure fluxes are described. The magnitude and direction of fluxes vary considerably with time, suggesting a dynamic, not steady-state transport behavior of membranes. Roots generally showed a net efflux of K+, a net influx of Ca2+ and variable H+ fluxes in the first 3 mm from the root tip. At greater distances H+ showed an efflux while K+ and Ca2+ fluxes became smaller and mixed. No evidence was found to support a mechanistic coupling of fluxes for any pair of the three ions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4390553849575655465", "cites_id": ["4390553849575655465"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0376738890800068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KUguy3Zh7jwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 8, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
