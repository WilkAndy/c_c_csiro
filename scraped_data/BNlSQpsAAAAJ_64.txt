Despite increases in citrate synthase activities in transgenic lines of up to 5-fold, neither internal citrate concentrations nor citrate efflux were increased compared to controls suggesting that, in tobacco, citrate synthase activity does not directly determine citrate accumulation and efflux. Consistent with a lack of effect on citrate efflux, the increase in citrate synthase activity did not enhance the aluminium resistance of the transgenic lines. Preliminary data collected on two transgenic lines with cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase activities reduced to one-tenth and one third of the control for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14378312574859757698", "cites_id": ["14378312574859757698"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022352914101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gkgMdhsHiscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 8, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
