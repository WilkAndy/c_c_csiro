A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (Triticum aestivum) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles \u2013 G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (Hordeum vulgare) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by \u223c 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1721881167313661130", "cites_id": ["1721881167313661130"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/179/4/1285/6116446", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ymwqe8xZ5RcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 17, "2021": 7, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
