What is less clear is whether root hairs that are longer than wild\u2010type provide an additional benefit to phosphorus (P) nutrition. This was tested using transgenic Brachypodium lines with longer root hairs. The lines were transformed with the endogenous BdRSL2 and BdRSL3 genes using either a constitutive promoter or a root hair\u2010specific promoter. Plants were grown for 32 d in soil amended with various Pi concentrations. Plant biomass and P uptake were measured and genotypes were compared on the basis of critical Pi values and P uptake per unit root length. Ectopic expression of RSL2 and RSL3 increased root hair length three\u2010fold but decreased plant biomass. Constitutive expression of BdRSL2, but not expression of BdRSL3, consistently improved P nutrition \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15395391685421742227", "cites_id": ["15395391685421742227"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.14980", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k7iQaytrp9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
