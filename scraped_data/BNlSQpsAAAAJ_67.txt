When plants were deprived of phosphate, APT1/APT2 expression and phosphate uptake, measured by both 32P and phosphate\u2010dependent changes in membrane potential, increased steadily over 4 to 7 d and both were inversely related to the internal phosphate concentrations in roots and shoots. When phosphate was resupplied to phosphate\u2010starved plants, the internal phosphate concentration and APT1/APT2 expression in roots were restored to control levels within 1 d whereas phosphate uptake took several days to decline to control rates. The increased expression of APT1/ATP2 genes when phosphate supply is restricted, and its close relationship with the internal phosphate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15159493628771626646", "cites_id": ["15159493628771626646"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00500.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lu66DSNXYdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
