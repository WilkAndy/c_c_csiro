The HvALMT1 gene is primarily expressed in guard cells of stomata, in regions behind the root apex and at lateral root junctions. We investigated the function of HvALMT1 in planta by overexpressing it in barley under the control of a constitutive promoter. Transgenic plants expressing HvALMT1 at levels four to 9-fold greater than controls showed reduced growth and plants showing the highest expression failed to set seed. Although measurements of conductance indicated that stomatal function was not totally impaired in the transgenic plants the time taken for the stomata to close in response to low light was significantly longer compared with controls. Elemental and metabolomic analyses of the transgenic barley shoots revealed that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11584533864341118564", "cites_id": ["11584533864341118564"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp10140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZB6JECyIxKAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
