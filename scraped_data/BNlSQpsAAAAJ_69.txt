The aims of this study were to determine the effect that a large rhizosheath has on the phosphorus (P) acquisition by wheat and to investigate the genetic control of rhizosheath size in wheat grown on acid soil.Near-isogenic wheat lines differing in rhizosheath size were evaluated on two acid soils. The soils were fertilized with mineral nutrients and included treatments with either low or high P. The same soils were treated with CaCO3 to raise the pH and detoxify Al3+. Genotypic differences in rhizosheath size were apparent only when soil pH was low and Al3+ was present. On acid soils, a large rhizosheath increased shoot biomass compared with a small rhizosheath regardless of P supply. At low P supply, increased shoot biomass could be attributed to a greater uptake of soil P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7629521374907091330", "cites_id": ["7629521374907091330"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/67/12/3709/2884886", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gkmWfUSB4WkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
