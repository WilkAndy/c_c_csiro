In this study, we investigated the spatial sensitivity of maize (Zea mays L.) roots to Al. A divided-chamber technique indicated that only exposure of the terminal 10 to 15 mm of the root to Al resulted in inhibition of growth. Application of Al to all but this apical region of the root had little or no effect on growth for 24 h and caused minimal damage to the root tissue. Small agar blocks infused with Al were then applied to discrete areas of the apex of maize roots to determine which section (root cap, meristem or elongation zone) was more important to Al-induced inhibition of growth. The terminal 2\u00b70 to 3\u00b70 mm of root (root cap and meristem) must be exposed to Al for inhibition. Application of Al to the 3\u00b70 mm of root proximal to this terminal zone (elongation zone) resulted in damage to the root tissue but no significant inhibition of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 831, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12198243886439539747", "cites_id": ["12198243886439539747"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/44/2/437/450482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IyTPhi_eSKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 8, "1994": 8, "1995": 23, "1996": 20, "1997": 28, "1998": 21, "1999": 19, "2000": 28, "2001": 47, "2002": 30, "2003": 20, "2004": 28, "2005": 31, "2006": 29, "2007": 37, "2008": 26, "2009": 45, "2010": 37, "2011": 34, "2012": 34, "2013": 45, "2014": 26, "2015": 28, "2016": 25, "2017": 31, "2018": 20, "2019": 16, "2020": 27, "2021": 26, "2022": 18, "2023": 5}}
