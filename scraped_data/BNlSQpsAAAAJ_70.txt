The two populations screened included recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from Chuan-Mai 18/Vigour 18 and doubled-haploid lines from Kukri/Janz. Glasshouse-grown plants were harvested at the five-leaf stage. Seven QTLs for shoot biomass were identified in the RILs, with the largest on chromosome 7A accounting for 7.4% of the phenotypic variance. RILs from the upper tail had larger embryos than RILs from the lower tail. Tail lines were then grown in non-limiting P and the results indicated that early vigour and the capacity to access P contributed to the initial distribution. The influence of early vigour on P nutrition was examined further with advanced vigour lines (AVLs). The AVLs accumulated more shoot biomass, maintained lower shoot P concentrations, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6864857069394278579", "cites_id": ["6864857069394278579"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/66/22/7089/2893271", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:szgTDyLfRF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
