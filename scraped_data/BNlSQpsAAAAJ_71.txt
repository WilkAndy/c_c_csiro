The present study was carried out to investigate whether lanthanides could stimulate malate efflux from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) roots, as has been found for trivalent aluminium (Al) cations. Excised root apices treated with 100\u2003\u00b5m of each of seven different lanthanide elements (lanthanum, praseodymium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, erbium, and ytterbium) stimulated malate efflux, with five\u2010 to fifty\u2010fold more malate being released from an Al\u2010tolerant wheat line than from a near\u2010isogenic Al\u2010sensitive line. As erbium stimulated the greatest malate efflux of the lanthanides tested, this response was characterized further. The characteristics of the erbium\u2010activated efflux were similar to the Al\u2010activated efflux described previously suggesting that both of these ions activate the same transport mechanism.
