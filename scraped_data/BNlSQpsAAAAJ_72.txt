The release of simple carboxylic anions such as citrate, malate and oxalate have been implicated in mechanisms of aluminium (Al) tolerance and improved acquisition of soil phosphorus. These metabolites are likely to cross cell membranes as multivalent anions and recent evidence indicates that anion-permeable channels facilitate this flow in the Al-dependent efflux of malate and citrate from wheat and maize, respectively. However, the genes encoding these anion channels, or any other protein that facilitates the release of citrate, malate or oxalate have not been isolated. This is an obstacle for the application of biotechnology to combat Al toxicity and to improve P-acquisition efficiency in plants. We discuss several strategies aimed at isolating genes that facilitate organic anion release from plant roots."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15754901681653805905", "cites_id": ["15754901681653805905"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022314010798", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UfMtPpunpNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
