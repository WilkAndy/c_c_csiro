In both systems, a stimulation in Ca2+ efflux (up to 100 nmol m\u22122 s\u22121, from an influx of \u223c40 nmol m\u22122 s\u22121) was detected as the H+ or K+ concentration was progressively increased in the bathing solution (pH 7.0 to 4.6 or K+ 0.2 to 10mol m\u22123, respectively). A Ca2+ influx of similar size occurred following the reverse changes. These fluxes decayed exponentially with a time constant of about 10 min. The threshold pH for Ca2+ efflux (pH 5.2) is similar to a reported pH threshold for acid\u2010induced wall extensibility in a closely related characean species. Application of NH4+ to intact cells caused prolonged H+ efflux and also transient Ca2+ efflux. We attribute all these net Ca2+ fluxes to exchange in the wall with H+ or K+.
