In contrast to bread wheat, TaMATE1B conferred greater aluminium tolerance than TaALMT1.Durum wheat (tetraploid AABB, Triticum turgidum) is a species that grows poorly on acid soils due to its sensitivity of Al3+. By contrast, bread wheat (hexaploid AABBDD, T. aestivum) shows a large variation in Al3+ tolerance which can be attributed to a major gene (TaALMT1) located on chromosome 4D as well as to other genes of minor effect such as TaMATE1B. Genotypic variation for Al3+ tolerance in durum germplasm is small and the introgression of genes from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6718447683777072204", "cites_id": ["6718447683777072204"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-015-2661-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TAyUkZK4PF0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
