Two contrasting cultivars, ROMA (Al tolerant) and POTCHETSTRM (Al sensitive), were selected to study shorter term responses to Al stress. POTCHETSTRM had higher callose synthase activity, lower \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucanase activity and more callose deposition in the root apices during Al treatment compared with ROMA. We monitored the expression of 12 genes involved in callose synthesis and degradation and found that one of these, SbGlu1 (Sb03g045630.1), which encodes a \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucanase enzyme, best explained the contrasting deposition of callose in ROMA and POTCHETSTRM during Al treatment. Full\u2010length cDNAs of SbGlu1 was prepared from ROMA and POTCHETSTRM and expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana using the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6936142953433067250", "cites_id": ["6936142953433067250"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.12472", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8u60UkQhQmAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
