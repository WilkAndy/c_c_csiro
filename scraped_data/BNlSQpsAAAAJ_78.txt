The protein localizes to the plasma membrane and facilitates malate efflux from cells when constitutively expressed in barley plants and Xenopus oocytes. This study investigated the function of HvALMT1 further by identifying its tissue\u2010specific expression and by generating and characterizing RNAi lines with reduced HvALMT1 expression. We show that transgenic plants with 18\u201330% of wild\u2010type HvALMT1 expression had impaired guard cell function. They maintained higher stomatal conductance in low light intensity and lost water more rapidly from excised leaves than the null segregant control plants. Tissue\u2010specific expression of HvALMT1 was investigated in developing grain and during germination using transgenic barley lines expressing the green \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11017582929740759153", "cites_id": ["11017582929740759153"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ppl.12234", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cQCbCk1R5pgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
