The response was five to tenfold higher in Al-tolerant seedlings than Al-sensitive seedlings and the capacity for Al-stimulated malate efflux was found to co-segregate with Al tolerance in a pair of near-isogenic wheat lines differing in Al-tolerance at a single dominant locus. We have investigated this response further using excised root apices. Half-maximal efflux of malate from apices of Al-tolerant seedlings was measured with 30 \u03bcM Al in 0.2 mM CaCl2, pH 4.2, while saturating rates of 2.0 nmol\u00b7apex\u22121\u00b7h\u22121 occurred with concentrations above 100 \u03bcM Al. The stimulation of malate efflux by Al was accompanied by an increase in K+ efflux which appeared to account for electroneutrality.
