The major gene for Al tolerance in barley is HvAACT1 (HvMATE) on chromosome 4H which encodes a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) protein. The HvAACT1 protein facilitates the Al-activated release of citrate from root apices which protects the growing cells and enables root elongation to continue. A 1 kb transposable element-like insert in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of HvAACT1 is associated with increased gene expression and tolerance and a PCR-based marker is available to score for this insertion.We screened a wide range of barley genotypes for Al tolerance and identified a moderately tolerant Chinese genotype named CXHKSL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3223213152641747226", "cites_id": ["3223213152641747226"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-016-2551-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GgmU9kgnuywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 11, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
