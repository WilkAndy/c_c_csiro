Both compounds display a greater potency against IKK.out(half maximal inhibition (IC50) values of 8.7 \u03bcM for NPPB and 5.3 \u03bcM for niflumic acid with [K+]o= 10 mM) than against IClCl.out(IC50 values of 150 and 100 \u03bcM respectively). Single-channel studies using detached patches show that these blockers reduce the percentage of time that IKK.out out channels are in their open state. The data show that caution is necessary when using these compounds on intact cells to ascribe physiological functions to anion channels in plant membranes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1728190267293613677", "cites_id": ["1728190267293613677"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/PP9960527", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bb5SSuTD-xcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
