This study examined the function of OsALMT4 from rice (Oryza sativa). We show that OsALMT4 is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) OsALMT4 released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1220774880983793649", "cites_id": ["1220774880983793649"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/175/4/1745/6116950", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8T_CS0kQ8RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
