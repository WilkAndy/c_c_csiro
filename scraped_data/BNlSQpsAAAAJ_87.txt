The beneficial effects of the microbial inoculants currently used in agriculture are inconsistent or short-lived because their persistence in soil and on roots is often poor. A complementary approach could use root exudates to recruit beneficial microbes directly from the soil and encourage inoculant proliferation. However, it is unclear whether the release of common organic metabolites can alter the root microbiome in a consistent manner and if so, how those changes vary throughout the whole root system. In this study, we altered the expression of transporters from the ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER and the MULTIDRUG AND TOXIC COMPOUND EXTRUSION families in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17745690703784990440", "cites_id": ["17745690703784990440"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/187/4/2279/6325518", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6FYOpaxbRfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
