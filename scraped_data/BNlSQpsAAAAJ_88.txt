We tested the hypothesis that these Al-activated ion fluxes would induce changes in the membrane potential (Vm) and that these responses would differ between wheat genotypes that differ in Al tolerance. Within minutes of exposing wheat roots to 50 \u03bcm AlCl3, a significant depolarisation was measured in the Al-tolerant ET8 genotype but not in a near-isogenic, Al-sensitive genotype, ES8. We investigated the ion movements that may be responsible for these changes in Vm by measuring real-time fluxes of Cl\u2013, H+ and K+ at the root apices of wheat seedlings using the non-invasive microelectrode ion flux estimation (MIFE) technique. Addition of 50 \u03bcm AlCl3 to the bathing solution stimulated an increase in K+ efflux and H+ influx in ET8 but not in ES8.
