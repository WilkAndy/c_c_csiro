Acid soils pose many stresses to plants but the major factor affecting plant growth is soluble aluminium with Al3+ being the most toxic form. Al3+ damages root cells at sites in the apoplast and in the cytosol and these rapidly inhibit root growth. Plants have evolved mechanisms that either avoid or minimize these damaging interactions by excluding Al3+ from the roots and leaves or by efficiently detoxifying any Al3+ that enters the cytosol. The genes conferring these resistance mechanisms have now been identified in some important crop species such as wheat, barley, sorghum and rice. Rapid progress in this field over the last decade provides exciting opportunities for increasing the Al3+ resistance of food crops through marker-assisted selection and genetic engineering."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18240339186097039207,563667428048163186", "cites_id": ["18240339186097039207", "563667428048163186"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1079/9781845939953.0171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z6fzKdmzIv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
