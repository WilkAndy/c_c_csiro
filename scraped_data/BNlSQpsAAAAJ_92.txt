Most genotypic variation for acid soil-tolerance in wheat is linked with the Al3+-activated efflux of malate anions from roots which is controlled by TaALMT1 on chromosome 4DL. Recent studies have also linked TaALMT1 with tolerance to high pH solutions and alkaline soils. This study tested the hypothesis that an Al3+-resistant allele of TaALMT1 also confers tolerance to alkaline conditions.The near-isogenic wheat lines, ET8 (Al3+-resistant) and ES8 (Al3+-sensitive), have different alleles of the TaALMT1 gene and contrasting resistance to Al3+ toxicity. Growth of these lines was compared in acid and alkaline soils with contrasting mineralogy and in a range of high pH hydroponic solutions of varying composition.No \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2528980754260835293", "cites_id": ["2528980754260835293"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-017-3549-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3TuEzZi-GCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
