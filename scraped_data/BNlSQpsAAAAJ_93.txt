The aim of this study was to enhance the Al3+ tolerance of an elite durum cultivar by introgression of a chromosomal fragment from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) that possesses an Al3+ tolerance gene.A 4D(4B) substitution line of durum wheat \u2018Langdon\u2019 was backcrossed to \u2018Jandaroi\u2019, a current semi-dwarf Australian durum. In the second backcross, using \u2018Jandaroi\u2019 as the recurrent parent, a seedling was identified where TaALMT1 on chromosome 4D was recombined with the Rht-B1b locus on chromosome 4B to yield an Al3+-tolerant seedling with a semi-dwarf habit. This seedling was used in a third backcross to generate homozygous sister lines with contrasting Al3+ tolerances.
