In these acid soils, aluminum (Al) toxicity is the primary factor limiting crop production via Al-induced inhibition of root growth. The physiological and molecular basis for Al tolerance is still poorly understood. Thus, we need a more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying Al tolerance if we are going to be able to develop more Al tolerant crop plants for improved cultivation on acid soils. In this paper, we used molecular, genetic, and physiological methods to study Al tolerance in the model plant species, Arabidopsis. We investigated the role of a gene that was a close relative of a recently identified wheat Al tolerance gene, ALMT1, in Arabidopsis Al tolerance. We showed that the related Arabidopsis gene encoded a transport protein that is the Al-activated malate efflux transporter that is critical for Arabidopsis Al tolerance. However, we also found that this gene does not vary in different lines of Arabidopsis that differ widely in Al tolerance. These findings show that this gene plays a key role in Arabidopsis Al tolerance but does not explain the genetic variation for this trait in Arabidopsis. These findings are important, as they indicate that there must be a novel gene that possibly interacts with this malate transporter and is responsible for the genetic variation for Al tolerance in different lines of Arabidopsis.Technical Abstract: Aluminum (Al) tolerance in Arabidopsis is a genetically complex trait yet is mediated by a single physiological mechanism based on Al-activated root malate efflux. We investigated a possible molecular determinant for Arabidopsis Al \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12189049300071583416", "cites_id": ["12189049300071583416"], "pub_url": "https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=189612", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uI59EMIzKKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1}}
