Many of the genes controlling these processes have been identified and their responses to Al treatment described in detail. This study investigated how the major Al resistance traits of wheat and rye are transferred to triticale (x Tritosecale Wittmack) which is a hybrid between wheat and rye. We generated octoploid and hexaploid triticale lines and compared them with the parental lines for their relative resistance to Al, organic anion efflux and expression of some of the genes encoding the transporters involved. We report that the strong Al resistance of rye was incompletely transferred to octoploid and hexaploid triticale. The wheat and rye parents contributed to the Al-resistance of octoploid triticale but the phenotypes were not additive. The Al resistance genes of hexaploid wheat, TaALMT1, and TaMATE1B, were more successfully expressed in octoploid triticale than the Al resistance genes in rye tested, ScALMT1 and ScFRDL2. This study demonstrates that an important stress-tolerance trait derived from hexaploid wheat was expressed in octoploid triticale. Since most commercial triticale lines are largely hexaploid types it would be beneficial to develop techniques to generate genetically-stable octoploid triticale material. This would enable other useful traits that are present in hexaploid but not tetraploid wheat, to be transferred to triticale."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5230559169060906258", "cites_id": ["5230559169060906258"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01334/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EqWJANqtlkgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 1}}
