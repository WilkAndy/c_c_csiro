Chimeric proteins from TaALMT1 and AtALMT1 (Ta::At, At::Ta) were previously analyzed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Those studies showed that Al could activate malate efflux from the Ta::At chimera but not from At::Ta. Here, functions of TaALMT1, AtALMT1 and the chimeric protein Ta::At were compared in cultured tobacco BY-2 cells. We focused on the sensitivity and specificity of their activation by trivalent cations. The activation of malate efflux by Al was at least two-fold greater in the chimera than the native proteins. All proteins were also activated by lanthanides (erbium, ytterbium, gadolinium, and lanthanum), but the chimera again released more malate than TaALMT1 or AtALMT1. In Xenopus oocytes, Al, ytterbium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "BNlSQpsAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6523828356244662571", "cites_id": ["6523828356244662571"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273616301122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K2mVRVNLiVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
