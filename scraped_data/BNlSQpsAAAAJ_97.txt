Root systems are not homogeneous organs but are comprised of different root types of various ages and anatomies that perform different functions. Relatively little is known about how this variation influences the distribution and abundance of microorganisms on roots and in the rhizosphere. Such information is important for understanding how root\u2013microbe interactions might affect root function and prevent diseases. This study tested specific hypotheses related to the spatial variation of bacterial and fungal communities on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots grown in contrasting soils. We demonstrate that microbial communities differed significantly between soil type, between host species, between root types, and with position along the root axes.
