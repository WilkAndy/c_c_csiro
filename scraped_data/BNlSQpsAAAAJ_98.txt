The root\u2013microbiome has a major impact on plant health through interactions on growth and development, facilitation of nutrient uptake and ability to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses. Renewed interest in plant\u2013microbe interactions has been driven by the availability of more precise molecular and analytical techniques that allow the detailed description and understanding of the dynamics of rhizosphere and endosphere communities. A better understanding of the succession of the root microbiome, i.e. how the microbiome changes in relation to crop growth, provides new opportunities for capturing the potential benefits from positive root\u2013microbiome interactions.
