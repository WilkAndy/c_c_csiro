As TEMPO2 is the only program available that can analyse multiple pulsar datasets simultaneously it will become an integral part of pulsar timing array projects which aim to detect the signatures of gravitational radiation in pulsar timing residuals. In this paper we describe the basic functionality of TEMPO2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12338379674524360147", "cites_id": ["12338379674524360147"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1009-9271/6/S2/35/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:053sQ_G6OqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
