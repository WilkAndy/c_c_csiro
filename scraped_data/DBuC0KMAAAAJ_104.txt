Our results bring the total number of pulsars in 47 Tucanae to 25. These pulsars were discovered by reprocessing archival observations from the Parkes radio telescope. We reprocessed the data using a standard search procedure based on the presto software package as well as using a new method in which we incoherently added the power spectra corresponding to \u223c1100 h of observations. The newly discovered PSR J0024\u22127204aa, has a pulse frequency of \u223c541 Hz (corresponding to a \u223c1.84 ms period), which is higher than any other pulsars currently known in the cluster and ranks 12th amongst all the currently known pulsars. The dispersion measure of this pulsar, 24.941(7) cm\u22123 pc, is the highest in the cluster. The second discovered pulsar, PSR J0024 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13217464304689429938", "cites_id": ["13217464304689429938"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/459/1/L26/2589562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sj1riMHdbbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
