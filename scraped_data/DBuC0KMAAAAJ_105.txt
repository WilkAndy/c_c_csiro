We have searched the literature to find papers announcing the discovery of pulsars or giving improved parameters for them. Data from the papers have been entered into a new pulsar catalog that can be accessed via a web interface or from the command line (on Solaris or Linux machines). The user may request over 120 different parameters, select pulsars of interest, generate custom variables and choose between different ways of displaying or tabulating the data. Full bibliographic references are available for all observed parameters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=948978632908942388", "cites_id": ["948978632908942388"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2004IAUS..218..139H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NCz56QlzKw0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
