Sect. 1 of this paper reviews the historical development of gravitational wave astronomy from Einstein\u2019s first prediction to our current understanding the spectrum. It is shown that detection of signals in the audio frequency spectrum can be expected very soon, and that a north-south pair of next generation detectors would provide large scientific benefits. Sect. 2 reviews the theory of gravitational waves and the principles of detection using laser interferometry. The state of the art Advanced LIGO detectors are then described. These detectors have a high chance of detecting the first events in the near future. Sect. 3 reviews the KAGRA detector currently under development in Japan, which will be the first laser \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16464636506342293771", "cites_id": ["16464636506342293771"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11433-015-5748-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CwF2TKsjfuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 14, "2017": 14, "2018": 10, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
