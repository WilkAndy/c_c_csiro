We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise models for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar time-scale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected time-scale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based time-scales are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:PyEswDtIyv0C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7338376673881414788", "cites_id": ["7338376673881414788"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/491/4/5951/5612203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hNy2WrQm12UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 16, "2023": 9}}
