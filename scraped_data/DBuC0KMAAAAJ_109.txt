Here we review the status of the three primary PTA projects and the joint International Pulsar Timing Array project. We discuss current results related to ultra-low-frequency gravitational wave searches and highlight opportunities for the near future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5540092980335429721", "cites_id": ["5540092980335429721"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-abstract/4/5/707/4566535", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WUiHgzZd4kwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
