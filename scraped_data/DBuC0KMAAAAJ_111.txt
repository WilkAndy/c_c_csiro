The measurements include contributions from a number of astrophysical and instrumental processes, which can either be deterministic or stochastic. It is necessary to develop robust statistical and physical models for these noise processes because incorrect models diminish sensitivity and may cause a spurious gravitational wave detection. Here we characterize noise processes for the 26 pulsars in the second data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array using Bayesian inference. In addition to well-studied noise sources found previously in pulsar timing array data sets such as achromatic timing noise and dispersion measure variations, we identify new noise sources including time-correlated chromatic noise that we attribute to variations in pulse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6217095631303004701", "cites_id": ["6217095631303004701"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/478/5957533", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HdJyfomPR1YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 14, "2022": 20, "2023": 9}}
