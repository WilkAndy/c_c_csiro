PSRs J1552\u22124937 and J1843\u22121448 are isolated objects with spin periods of 6.28 and 5.47 ms, respectively. PSR J1727\u22122946 is in a 40-d binary orbit and has a spin period of 27 ms. The 4.43-ms pulsar J1813\u22122621 is in a circular 8.16-d binary orbit around a low-mass companion star with a minimum companion mass of 0.2 M\u2299. Combining these results with detections from five other Parkes multibeam surveys, gives a well-defined sample of 56 pulsars with spin periods below 20 ms. We develop a likelihood analysis to constrain the functional form which best describes the underlying distribution of spin periods for millisecond pulsars. The best results were obtained with a lognormal distribution. A gamma distribution is less favoured, but still compatible with the observations.
