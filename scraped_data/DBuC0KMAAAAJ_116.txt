Recent observations, however, have added a new twist to this familiar plot: an elongated, radially oriented radio feature seen in projection against the SNR face. Utilizing the high resolution and sensitivity available with the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra, and XMM-Newton, we have obtained optical emission line images and spatially resolved X-ray spectral maps for this intriguing SNR. Our findings present the SNR itself as a remnant in the middle to late stages of its evolution. X-ray emission associated with the radio linear feature strongly suggests it to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). A small X-ray knot is discovered at the outer tip of this feature. The feature's elongated morphology and the surrounding wedge-shaped X-ray enhancement strongly suggest a bow shock PWN \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11216885027092701086", "cites_id": ["11216885027092701086"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/431349/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nh9CpoBhqpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
