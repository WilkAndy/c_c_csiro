The long-term scintillation, which shows orbital and annual variations, allows us to measure parameters that are difficult to measure with pulsar timing alone. These include: the orbital inclination i, the longitude of the ascending node \u03a9, and the pulsar system transverse velocity. We use the annual variations to resolve the previous ambiguity in the sense of the inclination angle. Using the correct sense, and a prior probability distribution given by a constraint from pulsar timing (i = 73 \u00b1 3\u00b0), we find \u03a9 = 24.8 \u00b1 1.8\u00b0 and we estimate the pulsar distance to be \u2009kpc. This then gives us an estimate of this pulsar\u2019s proper motion of \u03bc\u03b1cos\u2009\u03b4 = 2.9 \u00b1 1.0\u2009mas\u2009yr\u22121 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16943912458361401789", "cites_id": ["16943912458361401789"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/485/3/4389/5372441", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vXHysZveJOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 8}}
