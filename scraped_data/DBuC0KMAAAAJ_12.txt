Each ephemeris was obtained by analysing archival data stored at Jodrell Bank Observatory. This data archive contains over 5600 yr of pulsar rotational history with individual data\u2010spans of up to 34 yr. A new method has been developed to mitigate the effects of timing noise by whitening the pulsar timing residuals. This whitening is applied before standard fitting procedures are followed to measure the astrometric and dispersion measure (DM) parameters of a pulsar. We show that the values obtained using this new technique are consistent with other methods, and that the new timing solutions are, in general, significantly more precise than those in earlier publications. We consider the second derivative of the frequency \u03bd of pulsars, , and the DM gradient, d(DM)/dt, in detail. The  values are obtained by fitting to timing residuals that have not been whitened and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 484, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=307286752515554733", "cites_id": ["307286752515554733"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/353/4/1311/977600", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rX3fX6yzQwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 15, "2006": 28, "2007": 27, "2008": 19, "2009": 36, "2010": 32, "2011": 34, "2012": 28, "2013": 24, "2014": 22, "2015": 19, "2016": 38, "2017": 24, "2018": 17, "2019": 37, "2020": 28, "2021": 17, "2022": 28, "2023": 6}}
