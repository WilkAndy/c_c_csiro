The observations are obtained using the Parkes 64-m and 12-m radio telescopes by Australian and international high school students. These students learn the basis of radio astronomy and undertake small projects with their observations. The data are fully calibrated and obtained with the state-of-the-art pulsar hardware available at Parkes. The final data sets are archived and are currently being used to carry out studies of 1) pulsar glitches, 2) timing noise, 3) pulse profile stability over long time scales and 4) the extreme nulling phenomenon. The data are also included in other projects such as gamma-ray observatory support and for the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. In this paper we describe the current status of the project and present the first scientific results from the Parkes 12-m radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8565254498354817834", "cites_id": ["8565254498354817834"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/pulseparkes-project-a-new-observing-technique-for-longterm-pulsar-monitoring/7A9694CB4791FE8E812B79A6DAC4B111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KmtB6ZXl3XYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
