If the phase transition temperature is on the MeV scale, the power spectrum of the induced stochastic gravitational waves peaks around nanohertz frequencies, and can thus be probed with high-precision pulsar timing observations. We search for such a stochastic gravitational wave background with the latest data set of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We find no evidence for a Hellings-Downs spatial correlation as expected for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Therefore, we present constraints on first-order phase transition model parameters. Our analysis shows that pulsar timing is particularly sensitive to the low-temperature (T\u223c 1\u2013100 MeV) phase transition with a duration (\u03b2/H*)\u2212 1\u223c 10\u2212 2\u2212 10\u2212 1 and therefore can be used to constrain the dark and QCD phase transitions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5373046939609950794", "cites_id": ["5373046939609950794"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.251303", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SmrzVLnlkEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 18, "2023": 15}}
