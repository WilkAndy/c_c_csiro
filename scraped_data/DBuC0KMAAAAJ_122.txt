The primary goals for PTAs are to detect (and subsequently study) ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves, to develop a pulsar-based time standard and to improve solar system planetary ephemerides. FAST will have the sensitivity to observe known pulsars with significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios and will discover a large number of currently unknown pulsars. We describe how FAST will contribute to PTA research and show that jitter-and timing-noise will be the limiting noise processes for FAST data sets. Jitter noise will limit the timing precision achievable over data spans of a few years while timing noise will limit the precision achievable over many years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10785698867850949994", "cites_id": ["10785698867850949994"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/19/2/20/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:arWWqPl_rpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
