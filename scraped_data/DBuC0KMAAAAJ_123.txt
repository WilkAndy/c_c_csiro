It was recently demonstrated that single-pulse emission is responsible for limiting the timing stability of the brightest of millisecond pulsars. We report on an analysis of more than a million single pulses from PSR J0437\u22124715 and present various statistical properties such as the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) distribution, timing and polarimetry of average profiles integrated from sub-pulses with chosen S/N cut-offs, modulation properties of the emission, phase-resolved statistics of the S/N and two-dimensional spherical histograms of the polarization vector orientation. The last of these indicates the presence of orthogonally polarized modes (OPMs). Combined with the dependence of the polarization fraction on the S/N and polarimetry of the brightest pulses \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16720733846077774042", "cites_id": ["16720733846077774042"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/441/4/3148/1224297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2hhRv9f6C-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
