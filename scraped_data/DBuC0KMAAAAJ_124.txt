Regular observations of these pulsars may allow gravitational waves with frequencies \u223c10\u22129 Hz to be detected. A \u2018pulsar timing array\u2019 is therefore complimentary to other searches for gravitational waves using ground-based or space-based interferometers that are sensitive to much higher frequencies. In this review we describe (1) the basic methods for using an array of pulsars as a gravitational wave detector, (2) the sources of the potentially detectable waves, (3) current limits on individual sources and a stochastic background, and (4) the new project recently started using the Parkes radio telescope."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14173309216865354578", "cites_id": ["14173309216865354578"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/pulsars-and-gravitational-wave-detection/E50734387C1D69F33BFD4AE39AFF3A0B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UoMHq6O1scQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
