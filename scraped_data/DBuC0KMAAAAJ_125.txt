Central to the technique is the assumption that the detected radio pulses can be used to accurately measure the rotation of the pulsar. Here, we report on a broadband variation in the pulse profile of the millisecond pulsar J1643\u2212 1224. A new component of emission suddenly appears in the pulse profile, decays over four months, and results in a permanently modified pulse shape. Profile variations such as these may be the origin of timing noise observed in other millisecond pulsars. The sensitivity of pulsar-timing observations to gravitational radiation can be increased by accounting for this variability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12608951225546496351", "cites_id": ["12608951225546496351"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/828/1/L1/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X9nspFX--64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
