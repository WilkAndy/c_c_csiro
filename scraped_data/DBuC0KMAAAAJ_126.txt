The degree of arc curvature depends on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse velocity with respect to the line of sight. We report the observation of annual and orbital variations in the curvature of scintillation arcs over a period of 16 yr for the bright millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437\u2212 4715. These variations are the signature of the relative transverse motions of Earth, the pulsar, and the scattering medium, which we model to obtain precise measurements of parameters of the pulsar's binary orbit and the scattering medium itself. We observe two clear scintillation arcs in most of our> 5000 observations, and we show that they originate from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6785942526009826972", "cites_id": ["6785942526009826972"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abbd40/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nF4IIcaCLF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
