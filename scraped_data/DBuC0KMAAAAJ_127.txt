The pulse has three distinct emission components, which vary with frequency across our 1.0\u20131.5 GHz observing band. We measure the peak flux density to be> 0.065 Jy and the corresponding fluence> 0.2 Jy ms. Based on the observed dispersion measure of 1812 cm\u2212 3 pc, we infer a redshift of\u223c 1.9. From this, we estimate the peak luminosity and isotropic energy to be\u2272 2\u00d7 10 43 erg s\u2212 1 and\u2272 2\u00d7 10 40 erg, respectively. With only one FRB from the survey detected so far, our constraints on the event rate are limited. We derive a 95% confidence lower limit for the event rate of 900 FRBs per day for FRBs with fluences> 0.025 Jy ms. We performed follow-up observations of the source with FAST for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1601858705985713630", "cites_id": ["1601858705985713630"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab8e46/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3jWljgHyOhYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
