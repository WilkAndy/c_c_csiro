The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) is an implementation of the PTA concept based on observations with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. A sample of 20 ms pulsars is being observed at three radio-frequency bands, 50 cm (~700 MHz), 20 cm (~1400 MHz), and 10 cm (~3100 MHz), with observations at intervals of two to three weeks. Regular observations commenced in early 2005. This paper describes the systems used for the PPTA observations and data processing, including calibration and timing analysis. The strategy behind the choice of pulsars, observing parameters, and analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 481, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=127349593500007781", "cites_id": ["127349593500007781"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/parkes-pulsar-timing-array-project/9204C28386CBEF6310DCFB8E7EA8EF28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zb3b0sdvxAEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 27, "2014": 38, "2015": 51, "2016": 47, "2017": 28, "2018": 39, "2019": 48, "2020": 58, "2021": 53, "2022": 70, "2023": 22}}
