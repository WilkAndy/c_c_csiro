With a total of 20 glitches in 20 yr, it is one of the most frequently glitching pulsars of the\u223c 1750 known pulsars. Glitch amplitudes are very variable with fractional increases in rotation rate ranging from 10\u2212 9 to 10\u2212 6. Interglitch intervals are also very variable, but no relationship is observed between interval and the size of the preceding glitch. There is a persistent increase in, opposite in sign to that expected from slowdown with a positive braking index, which may result from changes in the effective magnetic dipole moment of the star during the glitch."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15929657953338350982", "cites_id": ["15929657953338350982"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/384/3/1063/988118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hl01doKDEd0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
