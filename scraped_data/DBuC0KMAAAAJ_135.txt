In contrast to the indirect constraints obtained from other techniques, pulsar timing observations provide a direct constraint on the black-hole merger rate. This is possible since pulsar timing is sensitive to the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by these sources in the final stages of their evolution. We find that upper bounds calculated from the recently published Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data are just above theoretical predictions for redshifts below 10. In the future, with improved timing precision and longer data spans, we show that a non-detection of GWs will rule out some of the available parameter space in a particular class of SMBH binary merger models. We also show that if we can time a set of pulsars to 10 ns timing accuracy, for example, using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10756681361867996928", "cites_id": ["10756681361867996928"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/730/1/29/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AP80ELVoR5UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
