We tested and used three pipelines, two (P1 and P2 hereafter) searched for the periodic signature of pulsars whereas the other one was used to search for bright single pulses (P3 hereafter). A pulsar candidate was discovered in the observation on the 22nd August, 2017, and later confirmed by the Parkes radio telescope on the 10th September, 2017. This pulsar, named PSR J1900-0134, was the first pulsar discovered by FAST. The pulsar has a pulse period of 1.8 s and a dispersion measure (DM) of 188 pc cm\u2212 3. The search for radio pulsars is one of the main science pursuits for FAST [2]. With the growing population of pulsars, we are finding pulsars exhibiting interesting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16334146956906262188", "cites_id": ["16334146956906262188"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11433-018-9354-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rO5sgx2MruIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 12, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
