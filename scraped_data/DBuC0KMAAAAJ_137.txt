Using sensitive single-pulse detections from FAST and long-term timing observations from the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, we probed phenomena on both long and short timescales. The FAST observations covered a wide frequency range from 270 to 800 MHz, enabling individual pulses to be studied in detail. The pulsar exhibits at least four profile components, short-term nulling lasting from 4 to 450 pulses, complex subpulse drifting behaviors and intermittency on scales of tens of minutes. While the average band spacing P 3 is relatively constant across different bursts and components, significant variations in the separation of adjacent bands are seen, especially near the beginning and end of a burst. Band shapes and slopes are quite variable, especially for the trailing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13465100257687010006", "cites_id": ["13465100257687010006"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab1849/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1np03Fel3boJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
