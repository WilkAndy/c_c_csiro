We detect radio emission from 2MASSW J0004348\u2212404405 increasing the number of radio loud ultracool dwarfs to 22. We also observe radio emission from 2MASS J10481463\u22123956062 and 2MASSI J0339352\u2212352544, two sources with previous radio detections. The radio emission from the three detected sources shows no variability or flare emission. Modelling this quiescent emission we find that it is consistent with optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission from a magnetosphere with an emitting region radius of (1\u20132)R*, magnetic field inclination 20\u00b0\u201380\u00b0, field strength \u223c10\u2013200 G, and power-law electron density \u223c104\u2013108 cm\u22123. Additionally, we place upper limits on four ultracool dwarfs with no previous radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12808100429680408569", "cites_id": ["12808100429680408569"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/457/2/1224/968844", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-fegBnuDv7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
