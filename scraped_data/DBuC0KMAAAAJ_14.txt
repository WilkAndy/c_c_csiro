We consider backgrounds whose characteristic strain spectra may be described as a power-law dependence with frequency. Such backgrounds include an astrophysical background produced by coalescing supermassive black-hole binary systems and cosmological backgrounds due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings. Using the best available data, we obtain an upper limit on the energy density per unit logarithmic frequency interval of \u03a9 h 2\u2264 1.9\u00d7 10-8 for an astrophysical background that is 5 times more stringent than the earlier limit of 1.1\u00d7 10-7 found by Kaspi and colleagues. We also provide limits on a background due to relic gravitational waves and cosmic strings of \u03a9 h 2\u2264 2.0\u00d7 10-8 and \u03a9 h 2\u2264 1.9\u00d7 10-8, respectively.
