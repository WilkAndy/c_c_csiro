Since its discovery more than a decade ago, data have been taken at several frequencies with instruments at the Green Bank, Parkes, Lovell and Westerbork telescopes. We measure scattering time-scales in the pulse profiles and dispersion measure changes as a function of binary orbital phase and present evidence that both of these vary as would be expected due to a wind from the companion star. Using pulse arrival times that have been corrected for the observed periodic dispersion measure changes, we find a timing solution spanning from 1997 November to 2011 March. This includes measurements of the advance of periastron, , and the change in the projected semimajor axis of the orbit, , and sets constraints on the orbital geometry. From these constraints, we estimate that the pulsar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16935002299944239394", "cites_id": ["16935002299944239394"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/425/3/2378/988822", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IoGZxt02BesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
