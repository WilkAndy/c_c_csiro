Here, we present the widest-band radio observations to date of an ultracool dwarf, DENIS-P J104814. 9\u2212 395604, in four 2 GHz bandwidths between wavelengths of 1 cm and 10 cm. These data were obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array using the new Compact Array Broadband Backend instrument. We detected a stable negatively sloped power-law spectrum in total intensity, with spectral index \u03b1= 1.71\u00b10.09. Circular polarization fractions between 0.25 and 0.4 were found at the low-frequency end of our detection band. We interpret these results as indicative of gyrosynchrotron emission. We suggest that the radio emission originates from beyond the corotation radius, R C, of the star. Adopting this model, we find R C between 1.2 R \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16026706010924312431", "cites_id": ["16026706010924312431"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/735/1/L2/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b-fCLDRMat4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
