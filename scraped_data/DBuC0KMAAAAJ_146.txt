Pulsar timing data collected in dense monitoring campaigns can also be used to study the stars themselves, their binary companions, and the intervening ionized interstellar medium. Timing observations are extraordinarily sensitive to changes in path-length between the pulsar and the Earth, enabling precise measurements of the pulsar positions, distances and velocities, and the shapes of their orbits. Here we present a timing analysis of 25 pulsars observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) project over time spans of up to 24\u2009yr. The data are from the second data release of the PPTA, which we have extended by including legacy data. We make the first detection of Shapiro delay in four Southern pulsars (PSRs J1017\u22127156, J1125\u22126014, J1545\u22124550, and J1732 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11027140412653337328", "cites_id": ["11027140412653337328"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/2/2137/6348112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8HqO8MdFCJkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 16, "2023": 10}}
