We also incorporate models for temporal variations in both pulse width and in the separation in phase of the main pulse and interpulse. We perform the analysis with both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods. In the latter case, we introduce a new parametrization of the posterior that is extremely efficient in the low signal-to-noise regime and can be readily applied to a wide range of scientific problems. We apply this methodology to a series of simulations, and to between seven and nine years of observations for PSRs J1713+0747, J1744\u22121134 and J1909\u22123744 with frequency coverage that spans 700\u20133600 Mhz. We use a smooth model for profile evolution across the full frequency range, and compare smooth and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7598409090071924934", "cites_id": ["7598409090071924934"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/466/3/3706/2738742", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xhDWL8_4cmkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
