It is found that the observed variations are dominated by changes in the Faraday rotation occurring in the Earth\u2019s ionosphere. Two ionospheric models are used to correct for the ionospheric contribution and it is found that one based on the International Reference Ionosphere gave the best results. Little or no significant long-term variation in interstellar RM was found with limits typically about 0.1 rad\u2009m\u22122\u2009yr\u22121 in absolute value. In a few cases, apparently significant RM variations over timescales of a few 100 days or more were seen. These are unlikely to be due to localised magnetised regions crossing the line of sight since the implied magnetic fields are too high. Most probably they are statistical fluctuations due to random spatial and temporal variations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18109201964003853326", "cites_id": ["18109201964003853326"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-011-0756-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DoRBVj3PUPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
