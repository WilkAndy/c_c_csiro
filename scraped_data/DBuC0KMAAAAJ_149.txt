Pulsar timing positions are referenced to a solar-system ephemeris, whereas VLBI positions are referenced to distant quasars. Here, we compare pulsar positions from published VLBI measurements with those obtained from pulsar timing data from the Nanshan and Parkes radio telescopes in order to relate the two reference frames. We find that the timing positions differ significantly from the VLBI positions (and also differ between different ephemerides). A statistically significant change in the obliquity of the ecliptic of 2.16 \u00b1 0.33 mas is found for the JPL ephemeris DE405, but no significant rotation is found in subsequent JPL ephemerides. The accuracy with which we can relate the two frames is limited by the current uncertainties in the VLBI reference source positions and in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13378050583817872583", "cites_id": ["13378050583817872583"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/469/1/425/3103049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x-SrQyBiqLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
