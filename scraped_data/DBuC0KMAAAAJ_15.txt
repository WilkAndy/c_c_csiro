In particular, arrays of pulsars with rotational periods of the order of milliseconds can be used to detect correlated signals such as those caused by gravitational waves. Three such \u2018pulsar timing arrays\u2019 (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past decades and collectively form the \u2018International\u2019 PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we describe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs, i.e. of the first IPTA data set. We describe the available PTA data, the approach presently followed for its combination and suggest improvements for future PTA research. Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as underestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have often been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and inhomogeneous data set \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 418, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=186142412833807340", "cites_id": ["186142412833807340"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/458/2/1267/2589038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7NuXyolPlQIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 16, "2017": 44, "2018": 55, "2019": 70, "2020": 59, "2021": 75, "2022": 71, "2023": 27}}
