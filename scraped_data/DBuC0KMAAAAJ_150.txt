PSR J1717+ 4308A, or M92A, has a pulse frequency of 316.5 Hz (3.16 ms) and a dispersion measure of 35.45 pc cm\u2212 3. The pulsar is a member of a binary system with an orbital period of 0.20 days around a low-mass companion that has a median mass of\u223c 0.18 M\u2299. From observations so far, at least two eclipsing events have been observed in each orbit. The longer one lasted for\u223c 5000 s in the orbital phase range 0.1\u20130.5. The other lasted for\u223c 500 s and occurred between 1000 and 2000 s before or after the longer eclipsing event. The lengths of these two eclipsing events also change. These properties suggest that J1717+ 4308A is a\" red-back\" system with a low-mass main-sequence or sub-giant companion.
