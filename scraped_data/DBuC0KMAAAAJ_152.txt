It also lists the orbital elements of binary pulsars, and some commonly used parameters derived from the basic measurements. The catalogue includes all published rotation-powered pulsars, including those detected only at high energies. It also includes Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) for which coherent pulsations have been detected. However, it excludes accretion-powered pulsars such as Her X-1 and the recently discovered X-ray millisecond pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4530970953881869219", "cites_id": ["4530970953881869219"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016yCat....102034M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o9u9kRM-4T4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
