Interpolation of the pulse phase between existing measurements is also often required, for example when folding X-ray or gamma-ray observations according to the radio pulse phase. Until now these procedures have been done using various ad hoc methods. The purpose of this paper is to show how to interpolate or predict the pulse phase optimally using statistical models of the various noise processes and the phase measurement uncertainty."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6679405243436846477", "cites_id": ["6679405243436846477"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/424/1/244/1008133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jU3vDa4DslwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
