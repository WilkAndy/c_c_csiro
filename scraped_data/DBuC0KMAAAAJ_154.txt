Using the\" Cholesky\" timing analysis method we have determined positions and proper motions for 48 pulsars, 24 of which are improved positions compared to previously published values. We also present the first published proper motions for nine pulsars and improved proper motions for 21 pulsars using the pulsar timing and position-comparison method. The pulsar rotation parameters are derived and are more accurate than previously published values for 36 pulsars. Glitches are detected in three pulsars: PSRs J1722\u2212 3632, J1852\u2212 0635, and J1957+ 2831. For the first two, the glitches are large, with \u0394\u03bd g/\u03bd> 10\u2212 6, and they are the first detected glitches in these pulsars. PSR J1722\u2212 3632 is the second oldest pulsar, with a large glitch.
