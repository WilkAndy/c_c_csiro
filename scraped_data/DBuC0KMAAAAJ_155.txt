These pulsars were discovered using an ultrawide bandwidth receiver in drift-scan observations made during the commissioning phase of FAST, and were then confirmed and timed using the 64-m Parkes Radio Telescope. Each pulsar has been observed over a span of at least one year. Highlighted discoveries include PSR J0344\u22120901, which displays mode-changing behaviour and may belong to the class of so-called swooshing pulsars (alongside PSRs B0919+06 and B1859+07); PSR J0803\u22120942, whose emission is almost completely linearly polarized; and PSRs J1900\u22120134 and J1945+1211, whose well-defined polarization angle curves place stringent constraints on their emission geometry. We further discuss the detectability of these pulsars by earlier surveys \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7441658111014458007", "cites_id": ["7441658111014458007"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/495/3/3515/5837094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l9Lr1p8URmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 8}}
