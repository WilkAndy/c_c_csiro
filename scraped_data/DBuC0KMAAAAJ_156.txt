Red timing noise \u2013 the stochastic wandering of pulse arrival times with a red spectrum \u2013 is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars and has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of timing noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise spectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, fc, potentially aiding the hunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by calculating minimum observation times, Tmin(fc), over which the gravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau. We do this in two ways: (1) in a model-independent manner, and (2) by using the superfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how neutron star parameters can be constrained. We show that the superfluid turbulence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6060824058210178673", "cites_id": ["6060824058210178673"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/449/3/3293/2893063", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cVbCi15fHFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
