It was initially developed by George Hobbs and Russell Edwards as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project. Tempo2 is based on the original Tempo (ascl: 1509.002) code and can be used (from the command-line) in a similar fashion. It is very versatile and can be extended by plugins."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9517979465025990692", "cites_id": ["9517979465025990692"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ascl.soft10015H/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JDBWIOWnFoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
