These data sets include the Lorimer burst (FRB 010724), which it pre-dates and which we also re-detect. The new burst has a much higher dispersion measure of 1187\u2009cm\u22123\u2009pc. The burst is one of the broadest found to date, the second earliest FRB known, and the ninth FRB discovered with a dispersion measure larger than 1000\u2009cm\u2009pc. Our discovery indicates that there are likely to be more burst events still to be found in the existing Parkes data archive."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16777367682705719902", "cites_id": ["16777367682705719902"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/484/1/L147/5347959", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XgLLYQQv1egJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
