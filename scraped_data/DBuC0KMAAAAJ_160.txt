These observations have allowed us to investigate the stability of the phased array feed beam weights over time, to demonstrate that pulsars can be timed over long periods using phased array feed technology and to detect and study the most recent glitch event that occurred on 2016 December 12. The beam weights are shown to be stable to 1% on time scales on the order of three weeks. We discuss the implications of this for monitoring pulsars using phased array feeds on single dish telescopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17219186382135830578", "cites_id": ["17219186382135830578"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/one-year-of-monitoring-the-vela-pulsar-using-a-phased-array-feed/C4F8C952F6E640ACF4C35D6ED50BC4DA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MihzjMjW9u4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
