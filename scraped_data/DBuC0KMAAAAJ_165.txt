We develop an accurate and efficient approach to compute Pulsar Timing Array signals due to gravitational waves from inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries in relativistic eccentric orbits. Our approach employs a Keplerian-type parametric solution to model third post-Newtonian accurate precessing eccentric orbits while a novel semianalytic prescription is provided to model the effects of quadrupolar order gravitational wave emission. These inputs lead to a semianalytic prescription to model such signals, induced by nonspinning black hole binaries inspiraling along arbitrary eccentricity orbits. Additionally, we provide a fully analytic prescription to model Pulsar Timing Array signals from black hole binaries inspiraling along moderately \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8367356790836458578", "cites_id": ["8367356790836458578"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.043022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UnTCSqvSHnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
