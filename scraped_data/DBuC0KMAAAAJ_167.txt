The students analyze their observations of radio pulsars and share their results with students in other schools. The data they obtain are also used by professional astronomers to support ongoing mainstream science projects. PULSE@ Parkes provides students with an opportunity to use an iconic Australian major national facility, experience a real observation session and interact with professional astronomers. The embedded education research program seeks to determine the true value of the observing experience and whether students engage with the extensive online project materials. This project is the first stage of a long-term plan to develop effective and stimulating education activities that utilize the wealth of data that will be produced by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12762792086938495547", "cites_id": ["12762792086938495547"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2008ASPC..400..190H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O6oibMiLHrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
