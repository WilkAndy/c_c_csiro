Two methods, the frequentist method and the Bayesian method, are used and the results are compared. We demonstrate that the two methods can be applied to young pulsar data sets that exhibit large amounts of timing noise with steep spectral exponents and give consistent results. The measured positions also agree with very long baseline interferometric positions. Proper motions for four pulsars are obtained for the first time, and improved values are obtained for five pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9722464700412606595", "cites_id": ["9722464700412606595"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/460/4/4011/2609171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gzheGSIi7YYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
