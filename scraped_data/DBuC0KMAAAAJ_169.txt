Here we describe the ongoing observing projects, the expected sources of gravitational waves, the processing of the data and the implications of current results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9792579048993361429", "cites_id": ["9792579048993361429"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-17251-9_20", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FY4uAsM65ocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
