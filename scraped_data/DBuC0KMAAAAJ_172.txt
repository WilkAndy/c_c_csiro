We found no evidence of a radio pulsar in our periodicity search and derived 8\u03c3 upper bounds on the flux density of any such source of Jy at 1.4\u2009GHz and Jy at 3\u2009GHz. Four candidate transient events were detected with greater than 7\u03c3 significance, with dispersion measures (DMs) in the range \u2009150\u2013840\u2009 cm\u22123 pc. For two of them, we found a second pulse at slightly lower significance. However, we cannot at present conclude that any of these are associated with a pulsar in SNR\u20091987A. As a check on the system, we also observed PSR\u2009B0540\u221269, a young pulsar that also lies in the LMC. We found eight giant pulses at the DM of this pulsar. We discuss the implications of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8425832240107352453", "cites_id": ["8425832240107352453"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/479/2/1836/5037951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hfGhyMeR7nQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
