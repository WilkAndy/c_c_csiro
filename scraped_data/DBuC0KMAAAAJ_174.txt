Here we review the status of the three primary PTA projects and the joint International Pulsar Timing Array project. We discuss current results related to ultra-low-frequency gravitational wave searches and highlight opportunities for the near future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5838691436498853528", "cites_id": ["5838691436498853528"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwx126/31566772/nwx126.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mB6hQe0yB1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
