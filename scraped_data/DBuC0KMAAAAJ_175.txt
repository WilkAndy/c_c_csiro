These fields are similar to those of the anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), which growing evidence suggests are \u201cmagnetars\u201d. The lack of AXP-like X-ray emission from these radio pulsars (and the non-detection of radio emission from the AXPs) creates new challenges for understanding pulsar emission physics and the relationship between these classes of apparently young neutron stars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13758589980237459400", "cites_id": ["13758589980237459400"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/two-radio-pulsars-with-magnetar-fields/4FB1990FB03EDD82609783405902FE7F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yG9N3rBU8L4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2}}
