These include the first observations of this pulsar in the 3 GHz frequency band, along with simultaneous observations in the 700 MHz band, and new observations around 1400 MHz. We show that the pulsar signal is not eclipsed in the 3 GHz band and observe the known eclipses in the lower-frequency bands. We find that the observed pulse signal becomes depolarized during particular orbital phases and postulate that this depolarization occurs because of rotation-measure fluctuations resulting from turbulence in the stellar wind responsible for the eclipses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13294264779345500717", "cites_id": ["13294264779345500717"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aadee0/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LRrgemG3frgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
