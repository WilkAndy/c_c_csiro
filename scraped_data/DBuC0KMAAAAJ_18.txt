Observations were obtained using the 76-m Lovell radio telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory over the past 36 years. These data sets have allowed us to carry out the first large-scale analysis of pulsar timing noise over time-scales of >10 yr, with multiple observing frequencies and for a large sample of pulsars. Our sample includes both normal and recycled pulsars. The timing residuals for the pulsars with the smallest characteristic ages are shown to be dominated by the recovery from glitch events, whereas the timing irregularities seen for older pulsars are quasi-periodic. We emphasize that previous models that explained timing residuals as a low-frequency noise process are not consistent with observation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 331, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14162926760277982925", "cites_id": ["14162926760277982925"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/402/2/1027/1103951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zT4-ntnSjMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 12, "2011": 21, "2012": 28, "2013": 19, "2014": 15, "2015": 36, "2016": 29, "2017": 28, "2018": 25, "2019": 24, "2020": 28, "2021": 25, "2022": 25, "2023": 13}}
