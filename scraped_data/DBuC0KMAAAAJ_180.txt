We studied the polarization properties, their energy distribution, and their times of arrival. This is only possible with the high sensitivity available using FAST. There is no indication that PSR J1022+ 1001 exhibits giant pulse, nulling, or traditional mode changing phenomena. The energy in the leading and trailing components of the integrated profile is shown to be correlated. The degree of both linear and circular polarization increases with the pulse flux density for individual pulses. Our data indicates that pulse jitter leads to an excess noise in the timing residuals of 67 ns when scaled to one hour, which is consistent with Liu et al. We have unsuccessfully trialed various methods to improve timing precision through the selection of specific single pulses. Our work demonstrates that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=879217352936087329", "cites_id": ["879217352936087329"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abd326/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IV8dMoabMwwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
