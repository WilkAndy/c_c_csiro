However, it was pointed out by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) collaboration that the same models used in recent analyses resulted in strong evidence for a common-spectrum process in simulations where none is present. In this work, we introduce a methodology to distinguish pulsar power spectra with the same amplitude from noise power spectra of similar but distinct amplitudes. The former is the signature of a spatially uncorrelated pulsar term of a nanohertz gravitational-wave background, whereas the latter could represent ensemble pulsar noise properties.
