The pulsars were discovered at a frequency of 500-MHz using the ultrawide-band (UWB) receiver in drift-scan mode, as part of the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS). We carried out the timing campaign with the 100-m Effelsberg radio-telescope at L-band around 1.36\u2009GHz. Along with 11 FAST pulsars previously reported, FAST seems to be uncovering a population of older pulsars, bordering and/or even across the pulsar death-lines. We report here two sources with notable characteristics. PSR J1951+4724 is a young and energetic pulsar with nearly 100 per\u2009cent of linearly polarized flux density and visible up to an observing frequency of 8\u2009GHz. PSR J2338+4818, a mildly recycled pulsar in a 95.2-d orbit with a Carbon\u2013Oxygen white dwarf (WD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3021990534115491365", "cites_id": ["3021990534115491365"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/508/1/300/6367149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jf6LLGFE8CkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
