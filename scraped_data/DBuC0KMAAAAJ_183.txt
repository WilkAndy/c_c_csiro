Here we discuss circularly polarized emissions produced by propagation effects in the magnetosphere of fast spinning magnetars. We argue that the polarization-limiting region is well beyond the light cylinder, suggesting that wave mode coupling effects are unlikely to produce strong circular polarization for fast spinning magnetars. Cyclotron absorption could be significant if the secondary plasma density is high. However, high degrees of circular polarization can only be produced with large asymmetries in electrons and positrons. We draw attention to the non-detection of circular polarization in current observations of known repeating FRBs. We suggest that the circular polarization of FRBs could provide key information on their origins and help \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7297435459655838020,16416285456009105459", "cites_id": ["7297435459655838020", "16416285456009105459"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac193d/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RCkgGOOyRWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
