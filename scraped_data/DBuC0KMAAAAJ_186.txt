For an all-sky photometric microlensing survey, we determine the number of lensing events caused by  potentially observable radio pulsars to be $\\sim 0.2\\{\\rm y}{{{\\rm r}}^{-1}} $ for 10 10 background stellar sources. We expect a few detectable events per year for the same number of background sources from an astrometric microlensing survey. We show that such a study could lead to precise measurements of radio pulsar masses. For instance, if a pulsar distance could be constrained through radio observations, then its mass would be determined with a precision of . We also investigate the timescale distributions for neutron star events, finding that they are much shorter than had been previously thought. For photometric events toward the Galactic center that last\u223c 15 days, around 7% will have a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18136349491849996677", "cites_id": ["18136349491849996677"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/802/2/120/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hSkOuMVBsfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
