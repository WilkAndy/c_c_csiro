The mass of dark matter candidates can span a wide range, and its coupling with the Standard Model sector remains uncertain. All these unknowns make the detection of dark matter extremely challenging. Ultralight dark matter, with m\u223c 10\u2212 22 eV, is proposed to reconcile the disagreements between observations and predictions from simulations of small-scale structures in the cold dark matter paradigm while remaining consistent with other observations. Because of its large de Broglie wavelength and large local occupation number within galaxies, ultralight dark matter behaves like a coherently oscillating background field with an oscillating frequency dependent on its mass. If the dark matter particle is a spin-1 dark photon, such as the U (1) B or U (1) B\u2212 L gauge boson, it can induce an external oscillating force and lead to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10144007158267727569", "cites_id": ["10144007158267727569"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L012022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0U6R48PAxowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
