The pulsar is in a black widow system that was discovered by the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS). By coincidence, a bright scintillation maximum was simultaneous with the eclipse in our observation, which allowed for precise measurements of flux density variations, as well as dispersion measure (DM) and polarization. We found that there are quasi-periodic pulse emission variations with a modulation period of\u223c 22 s during the ingress of the eclipse, which could be caused by plasma lensing. No such periodic modulation was found during the egress of the eclipse. The linear polarization of the pulsar disappears before the eclipse, even before there is a visually obvious change in DM. We also found that the pulse scattering may play an important role \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4363906444822908652", "cites_id": ["4363906444822908652"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac365c/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7A61ZMq1jzwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 6}}
