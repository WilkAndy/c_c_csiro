The radio emission for these pulsars switches off for year-long durations. Our new observations have enabled us to improve the determination of the on\u2013off timescales and the spin-down rates during those emission states. In general our results agree with previous studies of these pulsars, but we now have significantly longer data spans. We have identified two unexpected signatures in the data. Weak emission was detected in a single observation of PSR J1832+ 0029 during an off emission state. For PSR J1841\u2212 0500, we identified a quasi-periodic fluctuation in the intensities of the detectable single pulses, with a modulation period between 21 and 36 pulse periods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16270706691634258428", "cites_id": ["16270706691634258428"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab9302/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_GFut4cpzeEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
