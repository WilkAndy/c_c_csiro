We provide details of a new method for detecting a stochastic background of gravitational waves using pulsar timing data. Our results show that regular timing observations of 40 pulsars each with a timing accuracy of 100 ns will be able to make a direct detection of the predicted stochastic background from coalescing black holes within 5 years. With an improved prewhitening algorithm, or if the background is at the upper end of the predicted range, a significant detection should be possible with only 20 pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 315, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11823810312464445930", "cites_id": ["11823810312464445930"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/431220/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6jELftWcFqQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 15, "2007": 13, "2008": 15, "2009": 24, "2010": 27, "2011": 26, "2012": 31, "2013": 29, "2014": 19, "2015": 20, "2016": 15, "2017": 17, "2018": 18, "2019": 14, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
