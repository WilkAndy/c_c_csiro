It utilizes a 13-beam receiver operating in the 20-cm band on the Parkes 64-m radio telescope and is much more sensitive than any previous large-scale survey. Most of the 608 pulsars discovered so far are relatively distant and many are young, with 37 having a characteristic age of less than 10^5 years. At least one of these is associated with a supernova remnant and four other probable associations are suggested. Several multibeam pulsars have high values of the parameter Edot/d^2 and are within the position error contours of unidentified EGRET gamma-ray sources. These possible associations will be tested with the advent of new gamma-ray telescopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10535093250274675394", "cites_id": ["10535093250274675394"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0112166", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wso8an4rNJIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
