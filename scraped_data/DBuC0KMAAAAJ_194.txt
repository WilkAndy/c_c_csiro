The class of \u201cmillisecond pulsars\u201d (MSPs) have remarkably stable pulse periods, with a stability over long intervals comparable to that of the best atomic frequency standards. Timing observations of such pulsars in binary systems with another star have been used to make the most stringent tests of general relativity in strong gravitational fields. Observations of many MSPs, widely distributed across the sky and forming a \u201cpulsar timing array\u201d (PTA), have been used to set limits on the strength of the gravitational-wave background at nanohertz frequencies. These limits are beginning to constrain current ideas about the formation and evolution of supermassive binary black holes in the cores of distant galaxies. PTA observations can also be used to define a \u201cpulsar timescale\u201d that can limit or measure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3596280361391885990", "cites_id": ["3596280361391885990"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59909-0_30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pg56Te-N6DEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
