As reviewed in this paper, these data sets are been processed to 1) develop a pulsar-based time standard, 2) search for errors in the solar system planetary ephemeris and 3) detect gravitational waves. It is expected that the data sets will significantly improve in the near future by combining existing observations and by using new telescopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2534145024898356366", "cites_id": ["2534145024898356366"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/pulsar-timing-arrays-status-and-techniques/17BCBEB682B1711896FEF6A677961A75", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jtRjQnkXKyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
