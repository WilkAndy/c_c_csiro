Their nature is uncertain and most have not yet been associated with any known astrophysical object. One possibility is that they are radio pulsars. To test this hypothesis we undertook observations of 16 of these sources with the Parkes Radio Telescope. Our results limit the radio emission to a pulsed flux density of less than 0.21 mJy (assuming a 50 per cent duty cycle). This is well below the flux density of the IFRS. We therefore conclude that these IFRS are not radio pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18050326123839063614", "cites_id": ["18050326123839063614"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/415/1/845/989976", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PoZhk_mjf_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
