The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants. After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41 per cent using interferometers and the remaining 1 per cent using optical telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse velocities, respectively) derived from these measurements are somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the normal and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1325, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9064986177667932094", "cites_id": ["9064986177667932094"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/360/3/974/1000605", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vh-5deZMzX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 14, "2006": 47, "2007": 58, "2008": 62, "2009": 46, "2010": 62, "2011": 59, "2012": 59, "2013": 60, "2014": 49, "2015": 54, "2016": 63, "2017": 79, "2018": 92, "2019": 107, "2020": 99, "2021": 125, "2022": 123, "2023": 64}}
