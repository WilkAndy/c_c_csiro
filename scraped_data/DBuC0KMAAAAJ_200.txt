Drift-scan pulsar surveys will be carried out during this period using an ultra-wide-band receiver system (covering\u223c 270 to 1620 MHz). We describe a method for accounting for the changes in the telescope beam shape and the pulsar parameters when searching for pulsars over such a wide bandwidth. We applied this method to simulated data sets of pulsars in globular clusters that are visible to FAST and found that a representative observation would have a sensitivity of\u223c 40 \u03bcJy. Our results showed that a single drift-scan (lasting less than a minute) is likely to find at least one pulsar for observations of four globular clusters. Repeated observations will increase the likely number of detections. We found that pulsars in\u223c 16 clusters are likely to be found if the data from 100 drift-scan observations of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5716294629725987236", "cites_id": ["5716294629725987236"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/16/10/151/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pGFK9K1bVE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
