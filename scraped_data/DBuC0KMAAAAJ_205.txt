Precise positional and rotational parameters have been obtained from observations spanning between 6 and 34 years for over 300 of these pulsars. The parameters were determined by fitting a timing model to whitened pulse arrival times. In this paper, the technique used to whiten the timing residuals is summarised and the astrometric measurements are compared to proper motions determined earlier with interferometers. This novel approach has led to the first proper motion measurements for 111 pulsars and improved results for 15 pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1251381751162059955", "cites_id": ["1251381751162059955"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s7xrlBLNXREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
