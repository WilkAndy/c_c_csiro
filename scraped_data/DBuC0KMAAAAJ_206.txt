The timing campaigns were carried out with FAST and Arecibo over 3 yr. 11 of the 12 pulsars are in neutron star\u2013white dwarf binary systems, with orbital periods between 2.4 and 100 d. 10 of them have spin periods, companion masses, and orbital eccentricities that are consistent with the theoretical expectations for MSP\u2013Helium white dwarf (He WD) systems. The last binary pulsar (PSR J1912\u22120952) has a significantly smaller spin frequency and a smaller companion mass, the latter could be caused by a low orbital inclination for the system. Its orbital period of 29 d is well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6391601231059927444", "cites_id": ["6391601231059927444"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/518/2/1672/6643338", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lMFGm3SHs1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
