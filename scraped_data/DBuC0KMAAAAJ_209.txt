Using the world's most powerful radio telescopes, three major international collaborations have collected 10-year high precision timing data for tens of millisecond pulsars. In this paper we give an overview on pulsar timing experiments, gravitational wave detection in the nanohertz regime, and recent results obtained by various timing array projects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11537110776647792573", "cites_id": ["11537110776647792573"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06438", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vTdsCCANHKAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
