Divided into two major parts, the thesis describes development work for, and results from, the Parkes multibeam pulsar survey followed by an analysis of observations of a large number of pulsars by the radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank observatory. The survey observations and initial processing of the Parkes multibeam pulsar survey have been completed; the positional and rotational parameters for 120 new pulsar discoveries made during the survey are discussed in this thesis. A statistical analysis of 370 discoveries follows, mentioning in particular PSR J1830-1135, the second most slowly rotating radio pulsar so far detected, with a 6.2-second period, and PSR J1734-3333, with the second highest known surface magnetic field strength of 5.2 x 10e13 Gauss.
