The ultralight dark matter with mass m\u223c 10\u2212 23 eV will induce a periodic oscillation in gravitational potentials with a frequency in the nanohertz band, leading to observable effects in the arrival times of radio pulses from pulsars. Unlike scalar dark matter, pulsar timing signals induced by the vector dark matter are dependent on the oscillation direction of the vector fields. In this work, we search for ultralight vector dark matter in the mass range of [2\u00d7 10\u2212 24, 2\u00d7 10\u2212 22] eV through its gravitational effect in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) second data release. Since no statistically significant detection is made, we place 95% upper limits on the local dark matter density as \u03c1 VF\u2272 5 GeV/cm 3 for m\u2272 10\u2212 23 eV.
