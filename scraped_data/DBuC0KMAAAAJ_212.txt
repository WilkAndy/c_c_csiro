The spectral properties of this common-noise process are consistent with expectations for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries. However, recent simulation analyses based on Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data indicate that such a detection may arise spuriously. In this paper, we use simulated pulsar timing array data sets to further test the robustness of the inference methods for spectral and spatial correlations from a GWB. Expanding on our previous results, we find strong support (Bayes factors exceeding 105) for the presence of a common-spectrum noise process in data sets where no common process is present, under a wide range of timing noise prescriptions per pulsar. We show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:c1e4I3QdEKYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1573435287830311608", "cites_id": ["1573435287830311608"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/1/410/6654889", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uLIw0A731RUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
