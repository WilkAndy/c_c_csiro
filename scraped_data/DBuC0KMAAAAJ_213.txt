The recently localized FRB 20190520B is extremely active, has the largest confirmed host dispersion measure, and is only the second FRB source associated with a compact, persistent radio source (PRS). The main tracer of the magneto-ionic environments is the rotation measure (RM), a path-integral of the line-of-sight component of magnetic field strength (B) and electron density, which does not allow a direct probe of the B-field configuration. Here we report direct evidence for a B-field reversal based on the observed sign change and extreme variation of FRB 20190520B's RM, which changed from  rad m to  rad m between June 2021 and January 2022. Such extreme RM reversal has never been observed before in any FRB nor in any astronomical object. The implied short-term change of the B-field configuration in or around the FRB could be due to the vicinity of massive black holes, or a magnetized companion star in binary systems, or a young supernova remnant along the line of sight."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10622776258936197368", "cites_id": ["10622776258936197368"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08151", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-FBYwrmua5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
