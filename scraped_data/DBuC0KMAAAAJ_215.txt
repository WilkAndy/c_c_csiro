Polarized FRBs originate in highly magnetized environments. We report observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B spanning 17 months, which show that the FRB\u2019s Faraday rotation is highly variable and twice changes sign. The FRB also depolarizes below radio frequencies of about 1 to 3 gigahertz. We interpret these properties as being due to changes in the parallel component of the magnetic field integrated along the line of sight, including reversing direction of the field. This could result from propagation through a turbulent magnetized screen of plasma, located 10\u20135 to  parsecs from the FRB source. This is consistent with the bursts passing through the stellar wind of a binary companion of the FRB source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8924039655693767150", "cites_id": ["8924039655693767150"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abo6526", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
