Specifically, we focus on publicly verifiable randomness (PVR), in which the same sequence of trusted and verifiable random numbers is obtained by multiple parties. PVR is a critical building block for many processes and algorithms (including cryptography, scientific trials, electoral audits and international treaties). However, current approaches (based on number theory) may soon become vulnerable to quantum computers, motivating a growing demand for PVR based on natural physical phenomena. In this context, we explore pulsars as a potential physical PVR source. We first show that bit sequences extracted from the measured flux densities of a bright millisecond pulsar can pass standardised tests for randomness. We then quantify three illustrative methods of bit-extraction from pulsar flux density sequences, using simultaneous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7258225446803333541", "cites_id": ["7258225446803333541"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133722000038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:peFpkJZlumQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
