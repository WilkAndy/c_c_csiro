These observations were performed using the Parkes 64 m radio telescope with the Ultra-Wideband Low receiver system, which covers 704\u20134032 MHz. We confirm that PSR J1803\u2212 3002A is an isolated MSP located near the cluster center and probe the emission properties of the pulsar over the wide observed band. The mean pulse profile consists of three components, with the outer components becoming more prominent at higher frequencies, and a mean spectral index for the pulsed emission of\u2212 1.66\u00b10.07 over the observed band. The fractional linear and circular polarization increase with increasing frequency, which is unusual for pulsars. We determine a Faraday rotation measure of\u2212 107\u00b16 rad \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13072316729031956568", "cites_id": ["13072316729031956568"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abca40/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WJhYEc4yarUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
