Precise observations of millisecond pulsars over a period of  will provide the sensitivity required to detect ultra\u2010low frequency GWs if they are at the level predicted by current models. Such GWs may be detected as a single burst event or from slowly evolving individual supermassive black\u2010hole binary systems. Additionally, models of galaxy mergers, the inflationary era and cosmic strings all predict the existence of a potentially detectable stochastic GW background. This paper reviews the current status of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project and describes the detectable gravitational wave sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=732721065433841105", "cites_id": ["732721065433841105"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2840390", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0T2hSO0lKwoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3}}
