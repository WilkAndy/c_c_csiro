This sample is being used to determine 1) new pulsar-supernova remnant associations, 2) pulsar birth velocities (and hence the physical origin of the\" kicks\" that provide the pulsar birth velocities) and 3) those pulsars that were born well above the typical pulsar progenitor region of the Galaxy. We provide an overview of this project and report on new and updated results that are being obtained from this large sample of pulsar velocities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=559840023933257327", "cites_id": ["559840023933257327"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004cosp...35.1152H/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b4aWHYnzxAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
