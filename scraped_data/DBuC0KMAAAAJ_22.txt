The survey has discovered more than 600 new pulsars so far, including many that are young and exotic. In this paper we report the discovery of 200 pulsars for which we present positional and spin-down parameters, dispersion measures, flux densities and pulse profiles. A large number of these new pulsars are young and energetic, and we review possible associations of \u03b3-ray sources with the sample of about 1300 pulsars for which timing solutions are known. Based on a statistical analysis, we estimate that about 19 \u00b1 6 associations are genuine. The survey has also discovered 12 pulsars with spin properties similar to those of the Vela pulsar, nearly doubling the known population of such neutron stars.
