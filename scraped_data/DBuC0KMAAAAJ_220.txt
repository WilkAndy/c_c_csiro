We measured pulse scattering time-scales up to 0.2\u2009ms close to the eclipse and showed that it scales with the dispersion measure (DM) excess roughly as \u03c4 \u221d \u0394DM2. Our observations provide the first evidence of strong scattering due to multipath propagation effects in the eclipsing material. We show that Kolmogorov turbulence in the eclipsing material with an inner scale of \u223c100\u2009m and an outer scale of the size of the eclipse region can naturally explain the observation. Our results show that the eclipsing material in such systems can be highly turbulent and suggest that scattering is one of the main eclipsing mechanisms at around 1.4\u2009GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:zdjWy_NXXwUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6931658052938684840", "cites_id": ["6931658052938684840"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/2/1794/6566357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qNniDUYyMmAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
