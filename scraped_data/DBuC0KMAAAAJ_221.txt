It summerizes the header information in a PSRFITS file, reproduces some of fv's (ascl: 1205.005) functionality, and allows the user to obtain detailed information about the file. It can determine whether the data is search mode or fold mode and plot the profile, color scale image, frequency time, sum in frequency, and 4-pol data, as appropriate. pfits can also read in a search mode file, dedisperses, and frequency-sums (if requested), and offers an option to output multiple dispersed data files, among other tasks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6234561656637729447", "cites_id": ["6234561656637729447"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ascl.soft04013H/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p6opasuchVYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
