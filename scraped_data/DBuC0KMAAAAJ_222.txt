The wide frequency range of the UWL receiver (704\u20134032 MHz), along with the well-calibrated system, allowed us to obtain flux density measurements and polarization pulse profiles. The mean pulse profiles have significant linear and circular polarization, allowing for determination of the Faraday rotation measure for each pulsar. Precise measurements of the dispersion measures show a significant deviation in the value for pulsar D compared to earlier results. Searches for new pulsars in the cluster are ongoing and we have determined optimal bands for such searches using the Parkes UWL receiver system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8876542432394882246", "cites_id": ["8876542432394882246"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab5218/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xiyU9E_QL3sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
