These objects are known as pulsars. A pulsar is the remnant of a massive star that has reached the end of its own life and exploded in a supernova. These objects are extreme. Pulsars have a mass greater than that of our Sun. All this mass is squeezed into an object about 20km across (i.e., the size of a city) and they have a magnetic field strength billions of times greater than that of the Earth."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=169186798799766632", "cites_id": ["169186798799766632"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/ielapa.123837282996873", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aEQlQ38SWQIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
