Observations for 74 radio pulsars have been made regularly at an observing frequency of 1540 MHz as part of the Urumqi Observatory timing program, which commenced in 1999 November at the 25-m Urumqi Nanshan telescope. Currently 284 pulsars are monitored with an average interval between observations of\u223c 9 days. The dedispersion is provided by a 2\u00d7 128\u00d7 2.5 MHz filterbank/digitiser system. Accurate and updated periods, period derivatives and positions have been obtained for the majority of the 74 pulsars with timing observations spanning more than one year. For datasets spanning more than one year we have obtained improved positions, proper motions and velocities. Comparing our measurements of period and period derivative with earlier observations, we conclude that, long-term period and period \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3411226635737953339", "cites_id": ["3411226635737953339"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1009-9271/6/S2/33/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O_SCP40cVy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
