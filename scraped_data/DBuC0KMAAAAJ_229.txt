In this study, we search for continuous waves: gravitational wave signals produced by individual supermassive black hole binaries in the local universe. We consider binaries on circular orbits and neglect the evolution of orbital frequency over the observational span. We find no evidence for such signals and set sky averaged 95 per\u2009cent upper limits on their amplitude h95. The most sensitive frequency is 10 nHz with h95 = 9.1 \u00d7 10\u221215. We achieved the best upper limit to date at low and high frequencies of the PTA band thanks to improved effective cadence of observations. In our analysis, we have taken into account the recently discovered common red noise process, which has an impact at low frequencies. We also find that the peculiar noise features present in some pulsars data must be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12087182467752862005", "cites_id": ["12087182467752862005"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/521/4/5077/49780328/stad812.pdf", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
