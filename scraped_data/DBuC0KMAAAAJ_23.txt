Here we report the discovery of 120 new pulsars and subsequent timing observations, primarily using the 76-m Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. The main features of the sample of 370 published pulsars discovered during the multibeam survey are described. Furthermore, we highlight two pulsars: PSR J1734\u22123333, a young pulsar with the second highest surface magnetic field strength among the known radio pulsars, Bs= 5.4 \u00d7 1013 G, and PSR J1830\u22121135, the second slowest radio pulsar known, with a 6-s period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 265, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9547621587050066322", "cites_id": ["9547621587050066322"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/335/2/275/1044821", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:knH4eT_3f4QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 17, "2004": 24, "2005": 19, "2006": 14, "2007": 10, "2008": 19, "2009": 13, "2010": 8, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 21, "2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 15, "2020": 6, "2021": 12, "2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
