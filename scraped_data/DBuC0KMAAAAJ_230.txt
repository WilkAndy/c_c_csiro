The enormous data volumes produced by recent high-time resolution, radio-telescope surveys imply that efficient algorithms are required for a discovery. Such algorithms are usually tuned to detect specific, known sources. Existing data sets therefore likely contain unknown astronomical sources, which will remain undetected unless algorithms are developed that can detect a more diverse range of signals. We present the Single-dish PARKES data sets for finding the uneXpected (SPARKESX), a compilation of real and simulated high-time resolution observations. SPARKESX comprises three mock surveys from the Parkes \u2018Murriyang\u2019 radio telescope. A broad selection of simulated and injected expected signals (such as pulsars and fast radio bursts), poorly characterized signals (plausible flare star signatures), and \u2018unknown unknowns \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:unp9ATQDT5gC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14838966359045134053", "cites_id": ["14838966359045134053"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/516/4/5832/6695105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5VbbiEiZ7s0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
