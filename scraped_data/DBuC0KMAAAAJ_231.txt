The measured orbital period, 1.97 days, is the longest among all eclipsing binaries in globular clusters (GCs) and consistent with that of the coincident X-ray source U18, previously suggested to be a\" hidden MSP.\" Our XMM-Newton observations during NGC 6397B's radio-quiescent epochs detected no X-ray flares. NGC 6397B is either a transitional MSP or an eclipsing binary in its initial stage of mass transfer after the companion star left the main sequence. The discovery of NGC 6397B potentially reveals a subgroup of extremely faint and heavily obscured binary pulsars, thus providing a plausible explanation for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9175165465656017873", "cites_id": ["9175165465656017873"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac81c3/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0cPb_2C8VH8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
