Sometimes the radio pulse is undetectable, at other times the pulsed emission is weak, and for short durations the emission can be very bright. In order to improve our understanding of these state changes, we have identified archival data sets from the Parkes radio telescope in which the bright emission is present, and find that the emission never switches from the bright state to the weak state, but instead always transitions to the\" off\" state. Previous work had suggested the identification of the\" off\" state as an extreme manifestation of the weak state. However, the connection between the\" off\" and bright emission reported here suggests that the emission can be interpreted as undergoing only two emission states: a\" bursting\" state consisting of both bright pulses and nulls, and the weak emission state."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8670078337993845468", "cites_id": ["8670078337993845468"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab5d38/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3Kru9k9OUngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
