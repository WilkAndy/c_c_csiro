They can be used to detect irregularities in the atomic timescale used as a reference for the timing observations, thereby establishing a pulsar-based timescale which is independent of the reference timescale. The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) project has been timing 20 millisecond pulsars at 2\u20133 week intervals using the Parkes 64-m radio telescope since 2005. The PPTA data set has been analysed together with earlier timing data from Parkes using TT (TAI) as the reference timescale. The resulting timescale which we call PT (PPTA10) has deviations from TT (TAI) which closely match the differences between TT (BIPM10) and TT (TAI). This both demonstrates the practicality of a pulsarbased timescale and verifies that TT (BIPM10) is an improvement on TT (TAI)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16268798272929021412", "cites_id": ["16268798272929021412"], "pub_url": "http://syrte.obspm.fr/jsr/journees2011/pdf/manchester.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5D1sXNVhxuEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
