The project is ongoing and we currently observe approximately every three weeks. The data have led to numerous scientific results on topics as diverse as the solar wind, gravitational waves, measuring the masses of planetary systems in our solar system, atomic time scales, the interstellar medium and the pulsar emission mechanism. In this paper we provide an historical overview of the project and highlight the major discoveries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16561321633605530704", "cites_id": ["16561321633605530704"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0977", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ULQMtkei1eUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
