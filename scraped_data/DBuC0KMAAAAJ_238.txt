No gravitational\u2010wave signal was detected. We showed that, because of the variable data spans and noise levels across the 20 time series, only a few pulsars contribute to estimating the gravitational\u2010wave signal. This prohibits the calculation of a 95% confidence upper bound on the amplitude of the gravitational\u2010wave background."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15099960449321211314", "cites_id": ["15099960449321211314"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3615082", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:shU9kAbWjdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
