Here we present an analysis of the variations in DM for 20 millisecond pulsars. We show how they affect pulsar timing residuals and how they can be corrected. We also show that our new model of the solar wind electron density implemented into the TEMPO2 pulsar timing package is more accurate than previous models. This paper summarises the work presented in [1, 2]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15339726552633776962", "cites_id": ["15339726552633776962"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2840391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QhtduQao4dQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
