Two of these objects are part of an ongoing timing study at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). PSR J1756-2251 is a double-neutron star (DNS) binary system. It is similar to the original Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar system PSR B1913+ 16 in its orbital properties, thus providing another important opportunity to test the validity of General Relativity, as well as the evolutionary history of DNS systems through mass measurements. PSR J1802-2124 is part of the relatively new and unstudied\" intermediate-mass\" class of binary system, which typically have spin periods in the tens of milliseconds, and/or relatively massive (> 0.7 solar masses) white dwarf companions. With our GBT observations, we have detected the Shapiro delay in this system, allowing us to constrain the individual masses of the neutron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5277811176827510068", "cites_id": ["5277811176827510068"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AAS...208.0408F/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NN1jYk2NPkkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
