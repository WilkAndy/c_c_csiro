This pulsar's period, second largest among radio pulsars, and magnetic field, highest among all known radio pulsars, are indistinguishable from those of some Anomalous X-ray Pulsars, which are known to be magnetars. This discovery proves that inferred magnetic field cannot be the sole parameter determining whether a neutron star will exhibit magnetar-like properties. This discovery creates new challenges for understanding the emission mechanisms of and the relationship between these two manifestations of young neutron stars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1999647226324105317", "cites_id": ["1999647226324105317"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003HEAD....7.2009K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZbgkyY4swBsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
