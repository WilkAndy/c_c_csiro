Our observations were carried out using the ultra-wide-bandwidth receiver installed on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), as part of the pilot program for the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS). For three pulsars (PSRs J0426+4933, J0815+4611, J1529+40), we detected single pulses for the first time. Four pulsars [PSRs J0426+4933, J0815+4611, J1529+40, J1945\u22120040 (B1942\u201300)] were observed to undergo subpulse drifting. Notable features include bimodal behaviour in the nulling of PSR J0034\u22120721 (B0031\u201307). For this pulsar, short-duration (\u227210 period) null events were shown to be frequency-dependent, whereas long-duration null events were frequency-independent. The driftings of the pulse components for this pulsar overlapped in time, and the integrated profiles \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/521/2/2298/7078950", "cites_per_year": {}}
