The facility offers a powerful view of the southern hemisphere radio spectrum and supports world-leading research by Australian and international astronomers. Decades after the Culgoora Radioheliograph made fundamental discoveries about solar radio bursts, a new generation of radio telescopes in Australia are providing unique measurement capabilities to address outstanding questions in Heliophysics.
