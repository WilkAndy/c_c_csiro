Here we present the analysis of a 3 yr data set of 35 ms pulsars observed with the UWL by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, using wide-band timing methods. The two key differences compared to typical narrowband methods are (1) generation of two-dimensional templates accounting for pulse shape evolution with frequency and (2) simultaneous measurements of the pulse time of arrival (TOA) and dispersion measure (DM). This is the first time that wide-band timing has been applied to a uniform data set collected with a single large fractional bandwidth receiver, for which such techniques were originally developed. As a result of our study, we present a set of profile evolution models and new timing solutions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca535/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9ctz07yw-EsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
