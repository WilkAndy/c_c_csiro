In the most updated pulsar catalog, 24% of the listed radio pulsars have no flux density measurement at any frequency. Here, we report the first flux density measurements, spectral indices, pulse profiles, and correlations of the spectral index with pulsar parameters for 19 pulsars employing the Ultra-Wideband Low receiver system installed on the Parkes radio telescope. The results for spectral indices of 17 pulsars are in the range between\u2212 0.6 and\u2212 3.10. The polarization profiles of thirteen pulsars are shown. There is a moderate correlation between the spectral index and spin frequency. For most pulsars detected, the signal-to-noise ratio of pulse profile is not high, so DM, Faraday rotation measure, and polarization cannot be determined precisely. Twenty-nine pulsars were not detected in our observations. We discuss the possible explanations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/ac712b/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BDXUSocv3pYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
