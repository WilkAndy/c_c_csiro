In the first part of this paper, we show that ADC jitter noise, in the presence of strong, band-limited input signals, impacts the noise-floor performance of high-resolution ADCs which has a particularly harmful effect on pulsar radio astronomy. Furthermore, many of the current wide bandwidth RF ADCs typically rely on precise time-interleaving of several lower-rate ADCs to achieve high output resolution at the full Nyquist rate (see e.g. [3], [4]). In the second part of this paper, we present a new adaptive technique to mitigate the residual effects of time-interleaving artefacts from high-performance ADCs caused when strong, band-limited RFI is present at the converter input."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9814198/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uCKJsI29_JUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
