In the current pulsar catalogue, 27% of radio pulsars have no flux density measurement in the 20 cm observing band. Here, we present the first measurements of the flux densities in this band for 32 pulsars observed using the Parkes radio telescope and provide updated pulse profiles for these pulsars. We have used both archival and new observations to make these measurements. Various schemes exist for measuring flux densities. We show how the flux densities measured vary between these methods and how the presence of radio-frequency-interference will bias flux density measurements"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01077", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:18FVUyufsUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
