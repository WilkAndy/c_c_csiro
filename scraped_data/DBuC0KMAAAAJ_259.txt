Any error in the SSE will affect all pulsars, therefore pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are a suitable tool to search for such errors and impose independent constraints on relevant physical parameters. We employ the first data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array to constrain the masses of the planet-moons systems and to search for possible unmodelled objects (UMOs) in the Solar system. We employ 10 SSEs from two independent research groups, derive and compare mass constraints of planetary systems, and derive the first PTA mass constraints on asteroid-belt objects. Constraints on planetary-system masses have been improved by factors of up to 20 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ldr.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/2442", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O7771wYloSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
