There are currently just over 200 known pulsars with spin frequencies greater than 20 Hz, which therefore are within this band. In this paper, we describe the latest results from the ongoing search for gravitational waves from these known pulsars using data from the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). As this search looks for objects with known positions and spinevolutions, it can use long time spans of data in a fully coherent way to dig deeply into the detector noise. Here we use data from the entire two-year run of the three LIGO detectors, entitled Science Run 5 (S5), during which the detectors reached their design sensitivities (Abbott et al. 2009b). This run started on 2005 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 245, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7660251955258916778", "cites_id": ["7660251955258916778"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/713/1/671/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qv8yS5GuTmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 23, "2011": 45, "2012": 37, "2013": 31, "2014": 29, "2015": 20, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
