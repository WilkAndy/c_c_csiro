Timing was performed using the 42ft telescope and Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank (UK), the 26m telescope at Hartebeesthoek (South Africa), the Parkes radio telescope (Australia), the Nancay Decimetric Radio Telescope (France), the Arecibo Observatory (Puerto Rico) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Of these, 122 have been targeted in previous campaigns (Aasi+ 2014, J/ApJ/785/119), while 78 are new to this search."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017yCat..18390012A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
