They can be used to tie between referece frame based on solar system ephemerids and distant quasars with high accuracy. In this paper, we have collect the pulsar positions with VLBI measurement and obtain the pulsar timing position form Nanshan and Parkes data archive. We derive the rotation matrix between JPL DE and ICRF reference frame."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016cosp...41E2036W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
