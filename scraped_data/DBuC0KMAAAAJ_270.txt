Error in the Solar System ephemeris will induce a signal with spatial dipolar signature in pulsar timing residuals. Pulsar timingarray (PTA) observations give an independent method of searching for errors in the Solar System ephemeris and estimating the accuracy of the ephemeris. Here we develop a search algorithm for such error in the solar system ephemeris and apply the algorithm to data from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory DE421 planetary ephemeris. No significant ephemeris error was detected with our data set."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IAUGA..2241441W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
