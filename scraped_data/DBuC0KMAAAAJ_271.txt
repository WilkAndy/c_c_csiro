The program caters for a range of student ability and introduces students to hands-on observing and radio astronomy. Students are guided by professional astronomers, educators and PhD students during an observing session. They have ample time to interact with the scientists and discuss astronomy, careers and general scientific questions. Students use a web-based module to analyse pulsar properties. All data from the program are streamed via a web browser and are freely available from the online archive and may be used for open-ended student investigations. The data are also used by the team for ongoing pulsar studies with two scientific papers published to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IAUGA..2254038H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
