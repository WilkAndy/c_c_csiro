It is widespread in pulsars, especially in young pulsars. A better understanding of pulsar timing noise will lead to many important results. 280 pulsars have been monitored regularly with high observing cadence using the 25-m Nanshan radio telescope at the Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory since 2002. These data sets allow us to carry out a large-scale analysis of pulsar timing noise over time-scales of> 10 yr. In this paper, we present some initial analysis of timing noise for these pulsars. Quasi-periodic features are observed in the timing residuals of many pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IAUGA..2251996W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
