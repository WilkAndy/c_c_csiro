The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array project (PPTA) currently observes 23 pulsars with the Parkes Radio Telescope, largely in the southern sky, with the primary goal of searching for gravitational waves. The pulsars in the sample show large variations in flux density due to refractive scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM). These flux variations cause timing uncertainty to vary by more than an order of magnitude. A better understanding of flux-density variations associated with the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for optimizing observing strategy and increase the sensitivity of the PPTA to gravitational waves. Flux-density variations can also potentially be caused by magnetospheric state changes. We use flux density time series and structure functions to examine both the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AAS...22534617S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
