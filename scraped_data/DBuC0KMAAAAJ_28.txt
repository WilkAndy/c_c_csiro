In this paper, we provide timing solutions, flux densities and pulse profiles for 180 of these new discoveries. Two pulsars, PSRs J1736\u22122843 and J1847\u22120130, have rotational periods P > 6 s and are therefore among the slowest rotating radio pulsars known. Conversely, with P= 1.8 ms, PSR J1843\u22121113 has the third-shortest period of pulsars currently known. This pulsar and PSR J1905+0400 (P= 3.8 ms) are both solitary. We also provide orbital parameters for a new binary system, PSR J1420\u22125625, which has P= 34 ms, an orbital period of 40 d and a minimum companion mass of 0.4 solar masses. The 10\u00b0-wide strip along the Galactic plane that was surveyed is known to contain 264 radio pulsars that were discovered prior to the multibeam pulsar survey. We have redetected almost all of these pulsars and provide new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 239, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15527950626061135777", "cites_id": ["15527950626061135777"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/352/4/1439/1078009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oa8t5NJcftcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 11, "2005": 10, "2006": 18, "2007": 14, "2008": 12, "2009": 12, "2010": 9, "2011": 22, "2012": 10, "2013": 18, "2014": 13, "2015": 14, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 13, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
