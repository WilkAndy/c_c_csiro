This is important for future wide-band receiver systems and for improving the sensitivity of the P456 data sets to gravitational waves. To better develop and test our technique, we propose long tracks of PSR J1713+ 0747 to study the frequency evolution of pulse profile and its stability. Such studies will not only help us optimize our algorithm and evaluate its feasibility, but will also improve our understanding of the radiation mechanism of pulsars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6420D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
