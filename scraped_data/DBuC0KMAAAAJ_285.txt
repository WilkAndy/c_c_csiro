Fast radio transients are millisecond bursts of radio emission coming from cosmological distances, of which five are currently known. New discovery made in our searches will enabling better characterisation of this unexpected population of objects. We will also search for intermittent pulsars, which have duty cycles of 0.1 to 0.2 and time scales of weeks to months that were likely missed in previous surveys."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6122S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
