Given an 8-year timing RMS of 30ns, it is regarded as one of the best precision clocks in the PTA. However, sources of timing noise visible on timescales longer than the usual 20-30min biweekly observation may nonetheless be present. Data from the campaign were taken contiguously with the Parkes, Arecibo, Green Bank, GMRT, LOFAR, Effelsberg, WSRT, Lovell, and Nancay radio telescopes. The combined pulse times-of-arrival provide an estimate of the absolute noise floor, in other words, what unaccounted sources of timing noise impede an otherwise simple sqrt (N) improvement in timing precision, where N is the number of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22311404D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
