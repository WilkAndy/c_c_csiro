However, at seemingly random intervals the pulsar completely switches off and no radio emission can be detected. A large number of short observations already exist for this pulsar, but no long observations have been carried out with modern instrumentation. We propose observations with the dual-band 10/50cm receiver and the 20cm multibeam receiver in order to elucidate this unusual intermittent behaviour."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5664H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
