The data from some PULSE@ Parkes observations are used to support the FERMI Gamma ray mission, other observations supplement the P456 Pulsar Timing Array project and the remainder were chosen in order to make a detailed analysis of pulsar timing irregularities and intermittency."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5644H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
