At a typical observing wavelength, this delay can vary by tens of microseconds on 5-yr time-scales, far in excess of signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by a gravitational wave background. Measurement of these delay variations is not only crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an unparalleled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at astronomical unit (au) scales.In this paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength-independent red noise, \u2018simple\u2019 algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can attenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust method for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it to observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.
