In fact, when I was fairly young I wanted to be a biologist except I could never learn all the words and names for everything. When I was prob ably in high-school, I was in America, and there was a big planetarium there which certainly sparked my interest in astronomy. And then I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester, and on the way to Manchester you take the train past the Jodrell Bank Radio Telescope, which is a huge seventy-six metre telescope that certainly makes you look out the window. That got my interest in radio astronomy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1656459776161106636&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
