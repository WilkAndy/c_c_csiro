Such gravitational wave memory signals are detectable by pulsar timing arrays as a glitch event that would seem to occur simultaneously for all pulsars. In this paper, we describe an initial algorithm which can be used to search for gravitational wave memory signals. We apply this algorithm to the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array data set. No significant gravitational wave memory signal is founded in the data set."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/search-for-the-gravitational-wave-memory-effect-with-the-parkes-pulsar-timing-array/99643ADEDA69E0A3CB3941F8369C8F15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bu6-im8VndYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
