Its circularly polarised radio pulses are explained by a recent model, which has consequences for the frequency-time dependence, polarisation and spectra of the pulses which may be tested with the ATCA. We propose to perform these tests."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4600B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
