Pulsar Timing arrays could have the sensitivity, using existing facilities, to detect the rumble of the very lowest frequency gravitational waves. Independent absolute VLBI positions will remove one of the major contaminants of the timing signals. We will demonstrate a method to measure the precise absolute positions and proper motions with VLBI for two pulsars from the PPTA that are not in current astrometric programs. These pulsars have Southern declinations and are complementary to VLBA observational programs, including our own. We will use a new, advanced method to compensate for ionospheric errors which provide improved astrometry. In particular, we will use multiple calibrators to solve for the 2D spatial structure of the residuals, a method which we have been developing to address the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4743D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
