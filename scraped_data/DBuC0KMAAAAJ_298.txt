We are able to measure the pulsars' proper motions and derive an estimate for their space velocities. The measured two-dimensional velocities are in the range 70-210 km s (-1), consistent with those measured for other MSPs. We also use all the available proper motion information for isolated and binary MSPs to update the known velocity distribution for these populations. As found by earlier works, we find that the velocity distribution of binary and isolated MSPs are indistinguishable with the current data. Four of the pulsars in our observing program are highly recycled with low-mass white dwarf companions and we are able to derive accurate binary parameters for these systems. For three of these binary systems, we are able to place initial constraints on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ldr.lafayette.edu/handle/10385/1779", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EDFDNNLn9cwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
