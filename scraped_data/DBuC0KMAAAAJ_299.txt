At higher resolution, however, its inner jet exhibits stunningly periodic knots of enhanced radio emission spaced at intervals of~ 1 arcsecond. Based on previous X-ray and radio observations of the jet, the implied spacing of the knots is up to several 10's of kpc, with an implied periodicity of several thousand to several hundred-thousand years. We propose observations which will perform high-fidelity imaging of the substructures in the radio jet of PKS0637-752. We aim to precisely measure possible smaller-scale periodicities hinted at in previous observations, and spectral index and polarisation measurements of the structures. These observations will provide a strong statement on whether a binary supermassive black hole could be responsible for the observed periodicities, and on whether jet shock and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4434B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
