We have developed tempo2, a new pulsar-timing package that contains propagation and other relevant effects implemented at the 1-ns level of precision (a factor of \u223c100 more precise than previously obtainable). In contrast with earlier timing packages, tempo2 is compliant with the general relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and hence uses the International Celestial Reference System, Barycentric Coordinate Time and up-to-date precession, nutation and polar motion models. tempo2 provides a generic and extensible set of tools to aid in the analysis and visualization of pulsar-timing data. We provide an overview of the timing model, its accuracy and differences relative to earlier work. We also present a new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 1144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1018059631280519726", "cites_id": ["1018059631280519726"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/369/2/655/3101501", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LvqjOtffIA4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 24, "2009": 36, "2010": 47, "2011": 63, "2012": 81, "2013": 62, "2014": 67, "2015": 93, "2016": 76, "2017": 77, "2018": 82, "2019": 93, "2020": 102, "2021": 85, "2022": 91, "2023": 46}}
