In this paper we describe the project, explain how the data are collected and processed and describe current research. Our current data sets are able to place an upper bound on the gravitational wave background that is the most stringent to date."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16681796421522475141", "cites_id": ["16681796421522475141"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/30/22/224007/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hcg6IHalgecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 16, "2015": 20, "2016": 16, "2017": 10, "2018": 19, "2019": 20, "2020": 27, "2021": 37, "2022": 37, "2023": 16}}
