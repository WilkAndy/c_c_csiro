We are investigating the possibility of a pulsar backend for the ATCA capable of processing 2GHz baseband signals that form a tied array beam. Such a system would be nearly an order of magnitude more sensitive than existing systems at Parkes. Here, we propose to carry out pilot observations with the ATCA by recording baseband pulsar data using the VLBI system. We also propose simultaneous observations with Parkes, in order to provide independent,'control'measurements. These observations will thoroughly test the calibration procedures and the feasibility of pulsar timing with the tied array mode of the ATCA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4432R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
