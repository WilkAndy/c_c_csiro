This stability allows such pulsars to be used for numerous applications such as searching for gravitational waves or for developing a pulsar-based time standard. In general, millisecond pulsars are located at high Galactic latitudes, whereas most pulsar surveys are carried out near the Galactic plane. Searching for radio pulsars in gamma-ray sources has been proven to be an effective means to discover new millisecond pulsars. We propose to search for pulsars in 195 southern Fermi sources (Dec<-30 degree). In contrast to previous surveys we intend to use the 50cm receiver. In this current proposal, we propose to carry out test search observations of 19 known Fermi radio pulsars to verify the hardware and software pipeline and study the radio-frequency-interference environment. The observations will also be used to study the radio spectra of profile components of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4440X/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
