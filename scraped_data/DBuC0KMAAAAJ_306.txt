However, most of our knowledge originates from targeted observations of small samples, which are strongly biased to source which are peculiar at other wavelengths. In the absence of unbiased searches, it is very difficult to predict what will be found by SKA and its pathfinders such as ASKAP. We are proposing to use ATCA for a deep survey, following a similar observing strategy and technical details, as the ATLAS project, but this time focusing in a region more appropriate for stellar work. The proposed survey would have the best potential to enlarge the stellar radio emitting population, without suffering of selection criteria, providing new insights for a better comprehension of the physics of particular classes of stellar systems and of plasma processes in a wider context. As much as important, results from such \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.3992U/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
