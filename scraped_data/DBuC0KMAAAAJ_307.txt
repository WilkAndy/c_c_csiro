However, as violent solar flares happen, images captured in EUV wave bands may have saturation in active regions, resulting in signal loss. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model to restore the lost signal in saturated regions by referring to both unsaturated/normal regions within a solar image and statistical probability model of massive normal solar images. The proposed model, namely mixed convolution network (MCNet), is established over conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) and the combination of partial convolution (PC) and validness migratable convolution (VMC). These two convolutions were originally proposed for image inpainting. In addition, they are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3528995068373762770&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pirmWzdHMtIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
