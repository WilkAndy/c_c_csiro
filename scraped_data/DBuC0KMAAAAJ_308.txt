We measure the proper motion for each pulsar, infer 2-D space velocities, and update velocity distribution investigations of the MSP population, finding that binary and isolated MSPs have indistinguishable velocity distributions. We constrain binary inclination angles and hence masses for 2 of the pulsars in our sample. We use all the known wide-orbit pulsar--white-dwarf binaries to update previous limits on violation of the Strong Equivalence Principle and on a parameter describing violation of Lorentz invariance and momentum"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21713905S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
