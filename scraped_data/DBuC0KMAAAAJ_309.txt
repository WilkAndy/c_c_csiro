These techniques are often not sensitive to specific types of pulsar, such as millisecond pulsars or pulsars in fast binaries. An alternative approach is to try detecting pulsars in radio continuum surveys, but with the exception of a few notable cases, the majority of previous attempts using this method have been unsuccesful. However, the few pulsars succesfully detected via this method have been of high scientific interest, and with the rapid approach of the new and powerful instruments such as the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), which will be conducting new, highly sensitive radio continuum surveys with wide sky coverage, there is reason to pursue methods of pulsar detection in radio continuum. In this thesis, we present an investigation into these methods, presented in two parts. The first of these details the investigation of a selection of infrared-faint radio sources (IFRS), detected in radio continuum as part of the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) as to their possible identity as pulsars, and concludes with a non-detection of any pulsars. The second section investigates in further detail the suitability of the values of spectral index, fractional linear polarisation and fractional circular polarisation as means by which pulsar candidates can be selected from two of the the radio continuum surveys to be performed on ASKAP, EMU and POSSUM. It is concluded that of these candidate criteria, only circular polarisation presents any real prospect for future application in detecting pulsars in radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/student/theses/2010/cameron_thesis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yn6p29kRO2QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
