In order to fully exploit the scientific promises of our discoveries it is essential to perform continued timing observations. It is crucial that the observing sessions be spaced at three-to-five week intervals. The pulsars will be visible during LST 10: 00-19: 00 and the project should be scheduled within this interval."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3675E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
