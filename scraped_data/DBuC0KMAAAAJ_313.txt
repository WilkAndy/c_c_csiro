This star provides a unique laboratory for studying coherent radio emission mechanisms in a stellar environment. Observations taken for this proposal will allow us to determine whether the pulses are formed out a continuous emission process or discrete flares and thereby constrain the emission mechanism."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3100H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
