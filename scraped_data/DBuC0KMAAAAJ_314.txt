This object is composed of a hypergiant (Wray 977) and a slow spinning X-ray pulsar (GX301-2). The recent ATCA observations of centimeter emission (Pestalozzi et al. 2009, this was the first detection of radio emission towards BP Cru) suggested that radio emission consists of two components, a transient non-thermal one and a persistent thermal one, probably arising from the large stellar wind of Wray 977. As stellar winds often show a positive spectral index, we ask to observe BP Cru at 13 and 7 mm, where we expect fluxes of around 1 mJy. Any detection will allow us to probe the inner parts of the wind and characterise the structure of the stellar wind of BP Cru. For this detection experiment we require 11 hours of observations with ATCA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3298P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
