Ultracool dwarfs are the coolest stars, and include the sub-stellar brown dwarfs. Transient radio emission, as periodic pulses and isolated flares on timescales of minutes, along with quiescence, was recently discovered from some ultracool dwarfs, with significantly higher luminosities than predicted by physical models. The emission is thought to be magnetospheric and non-thermal. The pulses and flares are 100% circularly-polarised and coherent. Here, through ATCA observations of 15 targets within 10 pc, we will characterise the incidence of transient and quiescent emission, and correlate these results with physical stellar properties such as rotation and magnetic activity. The transient emission frequency is thought to be proportional to the local magnetic field strength: wide band 6/3 cm dynamic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3254R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
