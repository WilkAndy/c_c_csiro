The aims of this proposal are to study the 1) long-term timing behaviour, 2) temporal stability of the emission and 3) wide-band dynamic spectra of known stellar radio transients (known as\" stellar pulsars\"). We have therefore selected the five stellar pulsars that can be observed from the ATCA and are already known to be regular emitters of pulsed radio radiation. Their emission will be monitored over a timescale of months."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3205H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
