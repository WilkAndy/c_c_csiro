The radio emission appears at all orbital phases, but the spectral shape varies with the orbital phase. The latter fact suggest the existence of two components, a (thermal) persistent one and a periodic one, probably of non-thermal nature. The present experiment aims to clarify the magnitude of both components and to measure their degree of polarisation. This will give invaluable insights into the emission mechanisms and the accretion processes in BP Cru. We require 60 hours of simultaneous observations at 5 and 8 GHz with extended configurations, to be spread in 10 epochs between April 1 and May 6, 2010."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3222P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
