The SKA Science Case has been developed by an international team of astronomers and physicists, and one of the Key Science Projects is\" Probing Strong-field Gravity with Pulsars and Black Holes.\" Specific ways in which the SKA will probe gravity include 1. Conducting a survey for binary supermassive black holes. With milliarcsecond angular resolution capabilities, the SKA will find binary supermassive black holes with (projected) separations as small as a few parsecs. These are the progenitors of the population of merging supermassive black holes that will be probed with LISA, and the SKA will provide crucial constraints on this population. 2. Detecting and studying gravitational waves from in-spiraling supermassive black hole binaries.
