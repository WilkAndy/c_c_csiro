Numerous flaring events, some periodic, have lately surfaced, with only few identified with known objects such as magnetic stars. Periodic, non-thermal, highly circularly-polarised pulses and unusually strong quiescence have been recently detected from three late-type quickly-rotating (~ 2hr periods) ultracool dwarf stars (> M7) at centimetric wavelengths. This violates empirical relations and quantifiers of dwarf-star surface activity. Measurements of dwarf-star kiloGauss magnetic fields have led to emission models based on dipole fields and incoherent gyrosynchrotron or coherent electron-cyclotron maser mechanisms. We propose to observe two such similar objects at 1cm and 7mm (LP944-20 and DENIS1048-3956) that are known to flare but without detected periodicities. No observations of high-frequency emission from any magnetic star \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2480R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
