The data sets contain some of the most precise pulsar observations ever made. The presentation will provide an overview of the project and describe the main project aims that include: detecting gravitational waves, improving the terrestrial time scale and improving the planetary ephemeris."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009IAU...261.1103H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
