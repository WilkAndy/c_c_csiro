During processing some unexpected infrared-faint radio sources (IFRS sources) were discovered. The nature of these sources is not understood, but it is possible that some of these sources may be pulsars within our own galaxy. We propose to observe the IFRS sources with steep spectral indices using standard search techniques to determine whether or not they are pulsars. A pulsar detection would 1) remove a subset of the IFRS sources from the ATLAS sample so they would not need to be observed with large optical/IR telescopes to find their hosts and 2) be intrinsically interesting as the pulsar would be a millisecond pulsar and/or have an extreme spatial velocity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2019H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
