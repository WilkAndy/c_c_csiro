A complete new reprocessing is underway, which will greatly increase the sensitivity to highly-accelerated pulsars in very tight binary systems containing other neutron stars or even black holes. So far 13 new pulsars have been discovered using this system. The primary aim of this proposal is to conduct confirming observations of new candidates, followed by a timing programme which is essential to fully exploit the scientific benefits of any new discoveries. It is important that the observations be spaced approximately one month apart, as described in the science case. The sources will primarily be visible during the 08: 00-23: 00 LST range and the project should be scheduled within this interval."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2301E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
