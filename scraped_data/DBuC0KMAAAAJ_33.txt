This background produces low-frequency noise in the pulse arrival times that would have a characteristic spectrum common to all pulsars and a well-defined spatial correlation. Recently the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves collaboration (NANOGrav) found evidence for the common-spectrum component in their 12.5 yr data set. Here we report on a search for the background using the second data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. If we are forced to choose between the two NANOGrav models\u2014one with a common-spectrum process and one without\u2014we find strong support for the common-spectrum process. However, in this paper, we consider the possibility that the analysis suffers from model misspecification. In particular, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 213, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7977286473663184607", "cites_id": ["7977286473663184607"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac17f4/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3_44RsgDtW4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 16, "2022": 124, "2023": 73}}
