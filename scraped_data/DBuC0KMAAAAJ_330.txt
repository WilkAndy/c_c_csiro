Reobservation of 37 pointings, affected either by strong radio frequency interferences or by loss in sensitivity due to a fault in the parallactification of the 21-cm Multibeam receiver, is infact required in order to have a complete and uniform coverage of the selected area, crucial to fulfil the aims of this survey. Fourteen new pulsars have been to date discovered in the already observed portion of the survey, nine of which have a coherent timing solution. The five remaining objects, plus any that might be discovered in the last pointings to be observed, still require about a year of monthly timing observations, being only recently discovered. We hence require a total of 45 hours in this semester for a final tidying of the Perseus Arm Survey."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2132L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
