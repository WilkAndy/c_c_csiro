Recent surveys have uncovered a huge range of unexpected phenomena including the discovery of radio pulsations from the fast-rotating magnetic star CU Virginis and the M9 dwarf star TVLM 513-46546. We plan a targeted search for periodic bursts of radio emission from various types of stars. Here we propose a pilot study by targeting two highly-magnetic white dwarf systems and CU Virginis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1781H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
