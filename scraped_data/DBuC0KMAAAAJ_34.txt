We analyse and where possible combine high-precision timing data for 65 millisecond pulsars which are regularly observed by these groups. A basic noise analysis, including the processes which are both correlated and uncorrelated in time, provides noise models and timing ephemerides for the pulsars. We find that the timing precisions of pulsars are generally improved compared to the previous data release, mainly due to the addition of new data in the combination. The main purpose of this work is to create the most up-to-date IPTA data release. These data are publicly available for searches for low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:QyXJ3EUuO1IC", "num_citations": 208, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15038684838208508003", "cites_id": ["15038684838208508003"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/490/4/4666/5586597", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y5B4li4ktNAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 45, "2021": 70, "2022": 63, "2023": 29}}
