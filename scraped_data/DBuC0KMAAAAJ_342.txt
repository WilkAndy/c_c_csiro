This system provides an unprecedented laboratory for testing the timing predictions of strong-field gravitational theories and for investigating the interactions of the emissions of the two pulsars through eclipse and profile studies. We review the recent observations of this remarkable object, including the most precise test to date of general relativity in the strong-field regime."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-6544-6.pdf#page=69", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OtwSbWa2f5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
