The data will later become part of the GLAST mission support observations and the P456 Pulsar Timing Array project. This trial program will allow us to develop technical methods and the educational pedagogy for future student access of ATNF telescopes including ASKAP and eventually the SKA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1035H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
