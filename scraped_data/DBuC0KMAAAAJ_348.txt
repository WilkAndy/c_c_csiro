In fact, the very high orbital inclination gives the possibility of using the radio beams from pulsar A as a probe for investigating the region close to the surface of pulsar B, while relativistic effects modify the system geometry in a timescale suitable for comparing predictions of various models with observation. We present the status of the multi\u2010wavelength observations performed in the 3 years since the discovery and discuss short and long term perspectives for the study of the magnetosphere of pulsar B."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2774915", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bmZ3z52aPCoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
