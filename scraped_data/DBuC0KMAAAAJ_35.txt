We report on a reprocessing of all 40\u2003000 beams with a number of algorithms, including conventional frequency\u2010domain searches and an acceleration search for fast binary pulsars. The very large volume of results coupled with the need to distinguish new candidates from known pulsars and their many harmonics, often with multiple detections from different search algorithms, necessitated the development of a new graphical selection tool tightly linked to a web\u2010based results data base. We discuss and demonstrate the benefits of these software systems, which are specifically designed for large survey projects. The results of this processing have been encouraging. We have discovered 128 new pulsars, including 11 binary and 15 millisecond pulsars; in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 208, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7425425049772016883", "cites_id": ["7425425049772016883"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/355/1/147/3101503", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:88Tyvb1oDGcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 8, "2006": 20, "2007": 8, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 10, "2012": 12, "2013": 21, "2014": 14, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 15, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
