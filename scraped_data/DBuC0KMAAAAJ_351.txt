However recent ATCA observations at 6cm and 3cm have shown it to have a steep non-thermal spectrum, suggesting that it is a very young supernova remnant (SNR), probably the youngest known in our Galaxy. In this case, the central emission would be interpreted as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). We propose a search for a central pulsar which could drive this PWN. If confirmed this would be the youngest known pulsar, opening up unprecedented opportunities for study of pulsar and SNR evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..825M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
