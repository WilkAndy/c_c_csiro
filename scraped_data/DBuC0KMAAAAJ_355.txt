Two of these objects are part of an ongoing timing study at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). PSR J1756-2251 is a double-neutron star (DNS) binary system. Its orbital properties show it to be a similar system to PSR B1913+ 16, the original binary pulsar system discovered by Hulse and Taylor. Mass measurements of this system thus provide another important opportunity to test the validity of General Relativity, and to study the evolutionary history of DNS systems. PSR J1802-2124 is part of the relatively new and unstudied\" intermediate-mass\" class of binary pulsars. These typically spin with periods in the tens of milliseconds, and often have relatively massive (> 0.7 solar masses) white dwarf companions. GBT observations over the past two years have enabled us to detect the Shapiro delay in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AAS...20911502F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
