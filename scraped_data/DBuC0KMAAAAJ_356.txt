We propose frequent monitoring of the period of about 35 mostly young pulsars to provide a database for high-energy, ATCA and LBA observations of pulsars and to investigate variations in their period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..550M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
