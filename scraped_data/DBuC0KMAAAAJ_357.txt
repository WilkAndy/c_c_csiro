Timing observations are an essential to fully exploit the scientific benefits of these discoveries. It is imperative that the observations be spaced approximately once per month apart, as described in the science case. The sources will be visible during the 12: 00-20: 00 LST range and the project should be scheduled within this interval."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..563K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
