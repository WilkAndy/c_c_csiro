This experiment will complete the deep low latitude survey of the galactic plane strip visible from Parkes, providing an invaluable basis to any statistical study of the pulsar population and in particular improving the knowledge of the poorly known radial distribution of the pulsars in the outer regions of the Galaxy disk. Given the survey parameters and the sky coverage, this search will lead to the discovery of few tens of sources, with a good discovery rate (twice higher than for the two most recent large-scale searches performed at Parkes) and with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..310L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
