The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants. After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41% using interferometers and the remaining 1% using optical telescopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006yCat..73600974H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
