Results are also included, for the brighter pulsars, from the 30-m MkII telescope also situated at Jodrell Bank. The earliest TOAs for 18 pulsars (between the years 1968 and 1981) were obtained from observations using the NASA Deep Space Network (Downs & Reichley, 1983ApJS... 53.. 169D)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005yCat..73531311H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
