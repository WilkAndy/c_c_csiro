The consequences of these injections are far-reaching. SNe provide most of the hot gas component of the ISM, and through collective inputs to structures such as superbubbles (SBs), can transfer hot gas into a galaxy halo. The energy and heavy elements influence future generations of star formation in a galaxy and have a profound effect on galaxy evolution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AAS...205.7005W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
