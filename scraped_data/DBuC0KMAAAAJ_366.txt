This is higher than that inferred for the well-known``Anomalous X-ray Pulsar,''1E 2259+ 586, which is thought to be a magnetar. Here we report on a serendipitous Chandra X-ray Observatory detection of this pulsar. We show that the pulsar's X-ray luminosity is consistent with that expected simply from initial cooling of a young neutron star. Thus, in spite of the apparently magnetar-strength field in this radio pulsar, it shows no evidence for any magnetar-like emission. We discuss the implications for the magnetar model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004HEAD....8.1105K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
