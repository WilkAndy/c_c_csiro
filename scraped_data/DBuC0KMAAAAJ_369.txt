It uses a 13-beam receiver system operating at 1.4 GHz on the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. It has much higher sensitivity than any previous similar survey and is finding large numbers of previously unknown pulsars, many of which are relatively young and energetic. On the basis of an empirical comparison of their properties with other young radio pulsars, some of the new discoveries are expected to be observable as pulsed \u03b3-ray sources. We describe the survey motivation, the experiment characteristics and the results achieved so far."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1419462", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iyrPGQdVrHYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
