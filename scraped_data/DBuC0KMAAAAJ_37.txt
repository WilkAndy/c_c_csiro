Subsequent timing observations showed the pulsar to have an orbital period of 7.67 hr and an eccentricity of 0.18. They also revealed a significant advance of periastron, 2 fdg 585\u00b10 fdg 002 yr-1. Assuming this is entirely due to general relativity implies a total system mass (pulsar plus companion) of 2.574\u00b10.003 M\u2609. This mass and the significant orbital eccentricity suggest that this is a double neutron star system. Measurement of the gravitational redshift, \u03b3, and an evaluation of the Shapiro delay shape, s, indicate a low companion mass of less than 1.25 M\u2609. The expected coalescence time due to emission of gravitational waves is only~ 1.7 Gyr, substantially less than a Hubble time. We note an apparent correlation between spin period and eccentricity for normally evolving \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 206, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=198219253338723234", "cites_id": ["198219253338723234"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/427776/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:otPlVlw3wAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 17, "2006": 22, "2007": 20, "2008": 25, "2009": 13, "2010": 11, "2011": 12, "2012": 5, "2013": 17, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
