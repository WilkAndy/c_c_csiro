Of these, at least eight have been identified as members of binary systems. Three are reported on elsewhere: PSR J1811-1736 is a double-neutron star system with a 104-ms pulsar in an eccentric 19-day orbit (Lyne et al 2000, MNRAS, 698, 702); PSR J1141-6545 is a young 394-ms pulsar in a relativistic, eccentric, 5-hr orbit with a 1 M sun white-dwarf companion (Kaspi et al 2000, ApJ, in press); and PSR J1740-3052 is a 570-ms pulsar in a 231-day eccentric orbit with a companion of mass at least 11 M sun, possibly a late-type star (Stairs et al, this meeting). This paper concerns itself with the remaining 5 systems. Pulsars J1232-6501, J1435-6100, J1454-5846, J1810-2005, and J1904+ 0412 are all old,``recycled''pulsars, with characteristic ages greater than about 1 Gyr. As a group they differ from the usual millisecond pulsar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000AAS...197.8313C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
