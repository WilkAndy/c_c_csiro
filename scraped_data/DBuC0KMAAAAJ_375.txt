Until now this has been done using various ad hoc methods. The purpose of this paper is to show how this can be done optimally using statistical models of the various noise processes affecting the timing residuals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11552245926646378021&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Je61v3bSUaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
