This document provides input into the response by describing the science-case for the use of the 10-50CM receiver at Parkes for the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) observations. This document concentrates on the PPTA and makes use of analyses carried out for the specific PPTA pulsars, but similar arguments will apply for other high-precision pulsar timing experiments at Parkes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/memos/AT39.3_130.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
