In the model of a triaxial ellipsoid star, a deformation (possibly from shear strains in the solid part (s) of the star, or from magnetic stresses) can appear as a time-varying quadrupole moment as the star rotates. The observed loss of rotational energy, known as the spin-down luminosity (given by E= Izz\u2126| \u2126|= 4\u03c02Izzfrot| frot|, where Izz is the moment of inertia around the principal axis (aligned with the rotation axis), frot is the rotation frequency, and frot is the rotational frequency derivative) provides a huge reservoir of energy. Along with magnetic dipole radiation some fraction of this reservoir is potentially dissipated through gravitational wave emission (see Shklovskii 1969; Ostriker & Gunn 1969; Ferrari & Ruffini 1969; Melosh 1969 for four contemporaneous calculations of gravitational wave emission from soon after pulsars were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11891521146908471969", "cites_id": ["11891521146908471969"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/785/2/119/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oXKGqHorB6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 13, "2015": 36, "2016": 27, "2017": 37, "2018": 13, "2019": 20, "2020": 13, "2021": 17, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
