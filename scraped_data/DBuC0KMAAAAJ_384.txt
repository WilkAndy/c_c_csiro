With a novel line feed design, this concept is capable of delivering unprecedentedly wide fields-of-view (~ 100deg 2) with good spatial (~ 5arcsec) resolution. With current uncertainties surrounding the LOFAR project, it may also be appropriate to consider extending the HYFAR design to provide a potential low-cost alternative to the LOFAR high frequency band \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9827564210801289886&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nionwJSFYogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
