They are also known to have much higher mean orbital velocities and accelerations than those of other binary pulsars. The system is therefore a good candidate for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. We report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. These tests use the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars. By measuring relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital motion, we find that the \u201cpost-Keplerian\u201d parameter s agrees with the value predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, the most precise test yet obtained. We also show that the transverse velocity of the system's center of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 1045, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8241988029677197660", "cites_id": ["8241988029677197660"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1132305", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XFnu73FsYXIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 4, "2007": 30, "2008": 34, "2009": 66, "2010": 42, "2011": 47, "2012": 68, "2013": 76, "2014": 79, "2015": 57, "2016": 84, "2017": 75, "2018": 67, "2019": 76, "2020": 70, "2021": 70, "2022": 53, "2023": 39}}
