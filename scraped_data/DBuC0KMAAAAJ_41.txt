Pulsar observers are well aware that this assumption often breaks down and causes severe errors in estimating the parameters of the timing model and their uncertainties. Ad hoc methods for minimizing these errors have been developed, but we show that they are far from optimal. Compensation for temporal correlation can be done optimally if the covariance matrix of the residuals is known using a linear transformation that whitens both the residuals and the timing model. We adopt a transformation based on the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, but the transformation is not unique. We show how to estimate the covariance matrix with sufficient accuracy to optimize the pulsar timing analysis. We also show how to apply this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 186, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4341009160028130142", "cites_id": ["4341009160028130142"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/418/1/561/966106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xosx1tRcPjwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 13, "2013": 18, "2014": 16, "2015": 24, "2016": 19, "2017": 6, "2018": 17, "2019": 11, "2020": 27, "2021": 15, "2022": 12, "2023": 7}}
