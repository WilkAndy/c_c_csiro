SMBH population models, however, provide specific predictions for the properties of the gravitational-wave background (GWB) from binary SMBHs in merging galaxies throughout the universe. Using observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, we constrain the fractional GWB energy density (\u03a9GW) with 95% confidence to be \u03a9GW(H0/73 kilometers per second per megaparsec)2 < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22129 (where H0 is the Hubble constant) at a frequency of 2.8 nanohertz, which is approximately a factor of 6 more stringent than previous limits. We compare our limit to models of the SMBH population and find inconsistencies at confidence levels between 46 and 91%. For example, the standard galaxy formation model implemented in the Millennium Simulation Project is inconsistent with our limit with 50% probability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 178, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7482898982623023818", "cites_id": ["7482898982623023818"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1238012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ypJghfqY2GcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 36, "2015": 48, "2016": 14, "2017": 13, "2018": 19, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
