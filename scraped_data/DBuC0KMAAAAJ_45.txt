Such cataclysmic, transient, and extragalatic events are not however the only potential sources of observable gravitational waves. Galactic neutron stars offer a more local, and continuous, quasi-monochromatic source of gravitational radiation. Although intrinsically far weaker than the transient sources that have been observed, their continuous nature allows their signals to be found buried deep in the noise by coherently integrating over the long observing runs of the gravitationalwave observatories.The subset of known pulsars, identified through electromagnetic observations, provides an important possible source of continuous gravitational waves. They are often timed with exquisite precision, allowing their rotational phase evolution, sky \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11378157230253208581", "cites_id": ["11378157230253208581"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa677f/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BfTIg7dV550J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 23, "2018": 41, "2019": 41, "2020": 15, "2021": 29, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
