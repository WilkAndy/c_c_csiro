In our reference search for a power-law strain spectrum of the form , we found strong evidence for a spectrally similar low-frequency stochastic process of amplitude  and spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.5 \u00b1 0.5, where the uncertainties represent 95 per\u2009cent credible regions, using information from the auto- and cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in the array. For a spectral index of \u03b1 = \u22122/3, as expected from a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries, the recovered amplitude is .
