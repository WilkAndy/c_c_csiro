Any error in the conversion to the barycentric TOAs leads to a systematic variation in the observed timing residuals; specifically, an incorrect planetary mass leads to a predominantly sinusoidal variation having a period and phase associated with the planet's orbital motion about the Sun. By using an array of pulsars (PSRs J0437\u2212 4715, J1744\u2212 1134, J1857+ 0943, J1909\u2212 3744), the masses of the planetary systems from Mercury to Saturn have been determined. These masses are consistent with the best-known masses determined by spacecraft observations, with the mass of the Jovian system, 9.547921 (2)\u00d7 10\u2212 4 M\u2609, being significantly more accurate than the mass determined from the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft, and consistent with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 143, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1090199073892858564", "cites_id": ["1090199073892858564"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/720/2/L201/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xPrXFUgqIQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 12, "2014": 18, "2015": 17, "2016": 15, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
