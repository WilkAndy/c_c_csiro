This was demonstrated recently by the discovery of a previously unknown type of source,, varying on timescales of minutes to hours. Here we report a search for radio sources that vary on much shorter timescales. We found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having durations between 2 and 30\u2009ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4\u2009min to 3\u2009h with radio emission typically detectable for <1\u2009s per day. From an analysis of the burst arrival times, we have identified periodicities in the range 0.4\u20137\u2009s for ten of the eleven sources, suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Despite the small number of sources detected at present, their ephemeral nature implies a total Galactic population significantly exceeding that of the regularly pulsing radio pulsars.
