With a 16-yr data span, the results enable precision tests of theories of gravity for strongly self-gravitating bodies and also reveal new relativistic effects that have been expected but are now observed for the first time. These include effects of light propagation in strong gravitational fields which are currently not testable by any other method. In particular, we observe the effects of retardation and aberrational light bending that allow determination of the spin direction of the pulsar. In total, we detect seven post-Keplerian parameters in this system, more than for any other known binary pulsar. For some of these effects, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Xz60mAmATU4C", "num_citations": 137, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8055145309914177694", "cites_id": ["8055145309914177694"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.041050", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nqCWO_ufyW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 72, "2023": 64}}
