A comprehensive description of the pulsar observing systems employed at the telescope since 2004 is provided, including the calibration methodology and an analysis of the stability of system components. We attempt to provide full accounting of the reduction from the raw measured Stokes parameters to pulse times of arrival to aid third parties in reproducing our results. This conversion is encapsulated in a processing pipeline designed to track provenance. Our data products include pulse times of arrival for each of the pulsars along with an initial set of pulsar parameters and noise models. The calibrated pulse profiles \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11708654999996312498", "cites_id": ["11708654999996312498"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/parkes-pulsar-timing-array-project-second-data-release/6F6DF02ED3B1D8FCAFBB0E259ABB2402", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sqth-K9_faIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 14, "2021": 42, "2022": 53, "2023": 16}}
