We measure a proper motion of 67 mas yr-1, implying a transverse velocity of v= 385 km s-1. We derive an age of the pulsar and S147 of only 30\u00b14 kyr, which is a factor of 20 times less than the pulsar's characteristic age of \u03c4 c= 620 kyr. This age implies an initial spin period of P 0= 139 ms, close to the present pulse period and a factor of several larger than what is usually inferred for birth periods. Implications for recent X-ray detections of this pulsar are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11145392706180061164", "cites_id": ["11145392706180061164"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/378082/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7JcXjp1jrJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 17, "2005": 10, "2006": 8, "2007": 12, "2008": 6, "2009": 11, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
