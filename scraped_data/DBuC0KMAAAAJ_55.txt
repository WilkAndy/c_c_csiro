Such signals could be produced by individual supermassive binary black hole systems in the early stage of coalescence. We phase up the pulsar timing array data set to form, for each position on the sky, two data streams that correspond to the two GW polarizations and then carry out an optimal search for GW signals on these data streams. Since no statistically significant GWs were detected, we place upper limits on the intrinsic GW strain amplitude h0 for a range of GW frequencies. For example, at 10\u22128 Hz our analysis has excluded with 95\u2009per\u2009cent confidence the presence of signals with h0 \u2265 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221214. Our new limits are about a factor of 4 more stringent than those of Yardley et al. based on an earlier \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1375134197526526119", "cites_id": ["1375134197526526119"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/444/4/3709/1029897", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:p3gPUkR1FRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 24, "2016": 12, "2017": 11, "2018": 19, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
