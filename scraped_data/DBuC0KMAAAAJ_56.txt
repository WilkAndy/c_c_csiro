As the first precisely localized source, FRB 121102 (refs. \u2013) has been extensively observed and shows non-Poisson clustering of bursts over time and a power-law energy distribution\u2013. However, the extent of the energy distribution towards the fainter end was not known. Here we report the detection of 1,652 independent bursts with a peak burst rate of 122\u2009h\u22121, in 59.5 hours spanning 47 days. A peak in the isotropic equivalent energy distribution is found to be approximately 4.8 \u00d7 1037 erg at 1.25 GHz, below which the detection of bursts is suppressed. The burst energy distribution is bimodal, and well characterized by a combination of a log-normal function and a generalized Cauchy function.
