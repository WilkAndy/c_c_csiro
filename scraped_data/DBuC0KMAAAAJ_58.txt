Our analysis includes a detailed study of the effects of fitting a pulsar timing model to non-white timing residuals. Pulsar timing is sensitive at nanoHertz frequencies and hence complementary to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We place a sky-averaged constraint on the merger rate of nearby (z < 0.6) black hole binaries in the early phases of coalescence with a chirp mass of 1010 M\u2609 of less than one merger every 7 yr. The prospects for future GW astronomy of this type with the proposed Square Kilometre Array telescope are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13662808626466922298", "cites_id": ["13662808626466922298"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/407/1/669/986419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Oh-0ng4MnL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 15, "2012": 15, "2013": 18, "2014": 18, "2015": 13, "2016": 10, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
