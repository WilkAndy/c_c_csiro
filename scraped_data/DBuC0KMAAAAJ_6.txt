Here we introduce the project, review the methods used to search for gravitational waves emitted from coalescing supermassive binary black-hole systems in the centres of merging galaxies and discuss the status of the project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 772, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17257925569895784732", "cites_id": ["17257925569895784732"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/27/8/084013/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HOHEkd53gO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 28, "2011": 36, "2012": 44, "2013": 52, "2014": 60, "2015": 73, "2016": 59, "2017": 41, "2018": 49, "2019": 54, "2020": 57, "2021": 90, "2022": 82, "2023": 41}}
