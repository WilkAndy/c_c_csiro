The objects are highly recycled and are in orbits of many tens of days about low-mass white dwarf companions. The eccentricity of one object, PSR J1853+ 1303, is more than an order of magnitude lower than predicted by the theory of convective fluctuations during tidal circularization. We demonstrate that under the assumption that the systems are randomly oriented, current theoretical models of the core-mass-orbital-period relation for the progenitors of these systems likely overestimate the white dwarf masses, strengthening previous concerns about the match of these models to the data. The new objects allow us to update the limits on the violation of relativistic equivalence principles to 95% confidence upper limits of 5.6\u00d7 10-3 for the strong equivalence principle parameter| \u0394| and 4.0\u00d7 10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5413177635313045404", "cites_id": ["5413177635313045404"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/432526/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nE_sCmF4H0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 8, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 13, "2013": 2, "2014": 13, "2015": 8, "2016": 17, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
