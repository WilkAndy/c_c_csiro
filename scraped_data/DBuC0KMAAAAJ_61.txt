These variations induce jitter noise in pulsar timing observations; understanding the properties of this noise is of particular importance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. We assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecond pulsars that are part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array sample by examining intraobservation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. In 7 of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400\u2009MHz, we find that the brightest observations are limited by intrinsic jitter. We find consistent results, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequency bands. PSR J1909\u22123744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which we estimate to contribute \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1443436350126357741", "cites_id": ["1443436350126357741"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/443/2/1463/1063697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7fwqebYdCBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 24, "2016": 18, "2017": 10, "2018": 13, "2019": 6, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
