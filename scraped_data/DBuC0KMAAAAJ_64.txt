We use Bayesian methodology, performing model selection to determine the optimal description of the stochastic signals present in each pulsar. In addition to spin-noise and dispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise unique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved radio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different observing systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and band-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets. For example, we show that PSR J1643\u22121224 has, in addition to DM variations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs which we interpret as coming from time-variable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7996174060470820449", "cites_id": ["7996174060470820449"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/458/2/2161/2589092", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YV6ORPEd-G4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 15, "2018": 17, "2019": 12, "2020": 13, "2021": 18, "2022": 19, "2023": 4}}
