Such gravitational wave \u2018memory\u2019 (GWM) signals are, in principle, detectable through pulsar timing as sudden changes in the apparent pulse frequency of a pulsar. If an array of pulsars is monitored as a GWM signal passes over the Earth, the pulsars would simultaneously appear to change pulse frequency by an amount that varies with their sky position in a quadrupolar fashion. Here, we describe a search algorithm for such events and apply the algorithm to approximately six years of data from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We find no GWM events and set an upper bound on the rate for events which could have been detected. We show, using simple models of black hole coalescence rates, that this non-detection is not unexpected."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11752952773878234213", "cites_id": ["11752952773878234213"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/446/2/1657/2892038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZTz0LEfgGqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 14, "2016": 12, "2017": 13, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 13, "2021": 20, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
