We construct a distribution describing the binary SMBH population from an existing semi-analytic galaxy formation model. Using realizations of the binary SMBH population generated from this distribution, we simulate pulsar timing data sets with GW-induced variations. We find that the statistics of these variations do not correspond to an isotropic, stochastic GW background. The\" Hellings & Downs\" correlations between simulated data sets for different pulsars are recovered on average, though the scatter of the correlation estimates is greater than expected for an isotropic, stochastic GW background. These results are attributable to the fact that just a few GW sources dominate the GW-induced variations in every Fourier frequency bin of a five-year data set \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16127325135102408020", "cites_id": ["16127325135102408020"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/761/2/84/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VPUBn8PEz98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 15, "2014": 12, "2015": 20, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
