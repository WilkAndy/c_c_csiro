The nature of dark matter is currently unknown, with the mass of possible constituents spanning nearly one hundred orders of magnitude. The ultralight scalar field dark matter, consisting of extremely light bosons with m\u223c 10\u2212 22 eV and often called \u201cfuzzy\u201d dark matter, provides intriguing solutions to some challenges at sub-Galactic scales for the standard cold dark matter model. As shown by Khmelnitsky and Rubakov, such a scalar field in the Galaxy would produce an oscillating gravitational potential with nanohertz frequencies, resulting in periodic variations in the times of arrival of radio pulses from pulsars. The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) has been monitoring 20 millisecond pulsars at two-to three-week intervals for more than a decade. In addition to the detection of nanohertz gravitational \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9335654441117612430", "cites_id": ["9335654441117612430"], "pub_url": "https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.102002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jvmcdEDojoEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 16, "2020": 23, "2021": 17, "2022": 24, "2023": 7}}
