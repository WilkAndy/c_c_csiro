That is, as the peak flux of the pulsar approaches that of the system equivalent flux density, neither greater antenna gain nor increased instrumental bandwidth will improve timing precision. These conclusions proceed from an analysis of the covariance matrix used to characterize residual pulse profile fluctuations following the template-matching procedure for arrival time estimation. We perform such an analysis on 25 h of high-precision timing observations of the closest and brightest millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437\u22124715. In these data, the standard deviation of the post-fit arrival time residuals is approximately four times greater than that predicted by considering the system equivalent flux density, mean pulsar flux and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=447875559174984234", "cites_id": ["447875559174984234"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/418/2/1258/1073751", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KlI0uHIsNwYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 13, "2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
