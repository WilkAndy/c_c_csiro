Around 105 files are from surveys of the sky, the remainder are observations of 775 individual pulsars and their corresponding calibration signals. Survey observations are included from the Parkes 70 cm and the Swinburne Intermediate Latitude surveys. Individual pulsar observations are included from young pulsar timing projects, the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and from the PULSE@Parkes outreach program. The data files and access methods are compatible with Virtual Observatory protocols. This paper describes the data currently stored in the archive and presents ways in which these data can be searched and downloaded."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8267210251848390081", "cites_id": ["8267210251848390081"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/parkes-observatory-pulsar-data-archive/418EC1BC4EDDAC06B432646C8F72911D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wRXkKOwHu3IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
