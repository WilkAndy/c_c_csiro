To date, searches with pulsar timing arrays for GWs from binary SMBHs, in the frequency band \u223c1\u2013100 nHz, include the assumptions that all binaries are circular and evolve only through GW emission. However, dynamical studies have shown that the only way that binary SMBH orbits can decay to separations where GW emission dominates the evolution is through interactions with their environments. We augment an existing galaxy and SMBH formation and evolution model with calculations of binary SMBH evolution in stellar environments, accounting for non-zero binary eccentricities. We find that coupling between binaries and their environments causes the expected GW spectral energy distribution to be reduced with respect to the standard assumption of circular, GW-driven \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14379405098874269285", "cites_id": ["14379405098874269285"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/442/1/56/1225353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZW7Xh8DojccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 9, "2015": 22, "2016": 10, "2017": 16, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
