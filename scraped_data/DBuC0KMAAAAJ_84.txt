PSR J1016-5857 has a rotation period of 107 ms and period derivative of 8.0\u00d7 10-14, implying a characteristic age of 21 kyr and spin-down luminosity of 2.6\u00d7 10 36 ergs s-1. The pulsar is located just outside, and possibly interacting with, the shell supernova remnant G284. 3-1.8. Archival X-ray data show a source near the pulsar position that is consistent with emission from a pulsar wind nebula. The pulsar is also located inside the error box of the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1013-5915, for which it represents a plausible counterpart."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8994247229808756492", "cites_id": ["8994247229808756492"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/323171/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DMfKsjP80XwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 9, "2003": 7, "2004": 19, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
