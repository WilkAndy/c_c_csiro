We interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precession of the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system changing our view of the emission beam. Over those nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more than a factor of 3, reaching a maximum value of nearly 13 in early 2007. Large variations have also been observed in the 1400 MHz mean flux density; this reached a peak of\u223c 20 mJy in mid-2002 but over the past several years has been relatively steady at\u223c 3 mJy. The pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 April using digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variations in both linear and circular polarization. Position angle (PA) variations, both across the pulse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15877469171754493943", "cites_id": ["15877469171754493943"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/710/2/1694/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:92ek2hYaWNwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 13, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
