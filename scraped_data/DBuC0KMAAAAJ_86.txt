These observations, which span roughly 12 yr, were obtained with the 64-m Parkes radio telescope augmented by public domain observations from the Arecibo Observatory. A wide range of signal processing issues unique to pulsar timing and not previously presented in the literature are discussed. These include the effects of quadratic removal, irregular sampling and variable errors which exacerbate the spectral leakage inherent in estimating the steep red spectrum of the gravitational-wave background. These observations are found to be consistent with the null hypothesis that no gravitational-wave background is present, with 76 per cent confidence. We show that the detection statistic is dominated by the contributions of only a few pulsars \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17383764840057909660", "cites_id": ["17383764840057909660"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/414/2/1777/979140", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nLGT1gSKP_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 17, "2013": 19, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
