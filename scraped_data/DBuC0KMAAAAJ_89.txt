The simulation code, which has also been used for solar wind and atmospheric scattering problems, is available from the authors. These simulations reveal an unexpectedly important role of dispersion in combination with refraction. We demonstrate the effect of analyzing observations which are shorter than the refractive scale. We examine time-of-arrival fluctuations in detail: showing their correlation with intensity and dispersion measure, providing a heuristic model from which one can estimate their contribution to pulsar timing observations, and showing that much of the effect can be corrected making use of measured intensity and dispersion. Finally, we analyze observations of the millisecond pulsar J0437\u2212 4715, made with the Parkes radio telescope, that show timing fluctuations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1225105586396436346", "cites_id": ["1225105586396436346"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/717/2/1206/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:epeBOQpzABEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
