Any features that remain in the timing residuals after fitting for the expected pulsar parameters are suggestive of unmodelled physics such as binary companions, free precession or glitch events. In this paper we provide an overview of the features observed in the timing residuals that collectively are referred to as``pulsar timing noise''. We use results obtained from the literature and from the Jodrell Bank observatory archive of timing residuals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10432452900193406118", "cites_id": ["10432452900193406118"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1009-9271/6/S2/31/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:powFpKOEx5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 9, "2009": 11, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
