We have observed this system over a 1 yr interval using the Parkes 64 m radio telescope at three frequencies: 680, 1390, and 3030 MHz. These data, combined with the short survey observation made 2 years earlier, show no evidence for significant changes in the pulse profile of PSR J0737-3039A, the 22 ms pulsar. The limit on variations of the profile 10% width is about 0 fdg 50 yr-1. These results imply an angle \u03b4 between the pulsar spin axis and the orbit normal of\u2272 60, consistent with recent evolutionary studies of the system. Although a wide range of system parameters remain consistent with the data, the model recently proposed by FA Jenet & SM Ransom can be ruled out.
