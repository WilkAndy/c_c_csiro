Ongoing pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments are aimed at measuring the gravitational-wave (GW) emission from binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of galaxy merger remnants. In this paper, using the latest observational estimates for a range of galaxy properties and scaling relations, we predict the amplitude of the GW background generated by the binary SMBH population. We also predict the numbers of individual binary SMBH GW sources. We predict the characteristic strain amplitude of the GW background to lie in the range 5.1 \u00d7 10\u221216 < Ayr < 2.4 \u00d7 10\u221215 at a frequency of (1\u2009yr)\u22121, with 95\u2009per\u2009cent confidence. Higher values within this range, which correspond to the more commonly preferred choice of galaxy merger time-scale, will fall within the expected sensitivity ranges of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15076992086298210421", "cites_id": ["15076992086298210421"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/447/3/2772/2892968", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dTAu0Ws8PNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 18, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
