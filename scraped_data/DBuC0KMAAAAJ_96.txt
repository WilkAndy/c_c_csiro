The first, Sample G, contains pulsars which are detectable in blind searches of \u03b3-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The second, Sample R, contains pulsars detectable in blind radio searches which have spin-down luminosities \u0116> 10 34 erg s\u2212 1. We analyze the fraction of the \u03b3-ray-selected Sample G which have detectable radio pulses and the fraction of the radio-selected Sample R which have detectable \u03b3-ray pulses. Twenty of our 35 Sample G pulsars have already observed radio pulses. This rules out low-altitude polar-cap beaming models if, as is currently believed, \u03b3-ray beams are generated in the outer magnetosphere and are very wide. We further find that, for the highest-\u0116 pulsars, the radio and \u03b3-ray beams have comparable beaming factors \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15700018984243904135", "cites_id": ["15700018984243904135"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/716/1/L85/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hz6_ehWs4dkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 13, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
