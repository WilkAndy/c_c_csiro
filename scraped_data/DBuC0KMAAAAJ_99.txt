PSR J1357-6429, with a spin period of P= 166 ms and spin-down luminosity of 3.1\u00d7 10 36 ergs s-1, was detected during the Parkes multibeam survey of the Galactic plane. We have measured a large rotational glitch in this pulsar, with \u0394P/P=-2.4\u00d7 10-6, similar in magnitude to those experienced occasionally by the Vela pulsar. At a nominal distance of only~ 2.5 kpc, based on the measured free electron column density of 127 cm-3 pc and the electron distribution model of Cordes & Lazio, this may be, after the Crab, the nearest very young pulsar known. The pulsar is located near the radio supernova remnant candidate G309. 8-2.6."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DBuC0KMAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6630569889784827594", "cites_id": ["6630569889784827594"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/423620/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yo4GOy-EBFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 9, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 10, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
