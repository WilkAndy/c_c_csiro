Experimental evidence suggests that if these trends continue, key marine organisms\u2014such as corals and some plankton\u2014will have difficulty maintaining their external calcium carbonate skeletons. Here we use 13 models of the ocean\u2013carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:nS6_t4fuB3kC", "num_citations": 5656, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14322746613310443428,17124490726683731824", "cites_id": ["14322746613310443428", "17124490726683731824"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pE9M3iiexMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 20, "2002": 16, "2003": 33, "2004": 39, "2005": 40, "2006": 81, "2007": 139, "2008": 195, "2009": 277, "2010": 303, "2011": 375, "2012": 366, "2013": 437, "2014": 402, "2015": 396, "2016": 385, "2017": 359, "2018": 366, "2019": 337, "2020": 332, "2021": 265, "2022": 292, "2023": 108}}
