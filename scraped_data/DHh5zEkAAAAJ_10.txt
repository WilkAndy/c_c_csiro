Climate change projection till the end of this century predict a 4 to 7% decline in the dissolve oxygen in the ocean [Bopp et al., 2002; Matear et al., 2000; Plattner et al., 2001; Sarmiento et al., 1998] suggesting the potential for global warming to eventually drive the deep ocean anoxic. To examine the multicentury impact of protracted global warming on oceanic concentrations of dissolved oxygen, we use a climate system model and a low\u2010order oceanic biogeochemical model. The models are integrated for an atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration, which is specified to triple according to a standard scenario from the late nineteenth to the late twenty\u2010first century, and then is subsequently held constant at that elevated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 327, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4900263750528122686", "cites_id": ["4900263750528122686"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002GB001997", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pr_zG-s7AUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 9, "2009": 12, "2010": 17, "2011": 15, "2012": 27, "2013": 21, "2014": 21, "2015": 30, "2016": 19, "2017": 21, "2018": 25, "2019": 22, "2020": 18, "2021": 21, "2022": 25, "2023": 8}}
