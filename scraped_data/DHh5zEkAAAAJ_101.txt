This paper presents the seasonality and spatial variability of surface Chl, nutrients, temperature, light availability in the region. First, we verify that remotely sensed ocean color zonal gradient reflects a real gradient in Chl. From seasonal and spatial patterns in the region, we conclude that neither temperature, macro-nutrients nor light availability can account for the observed large zonal gradient in the surface Chl. Other factors such as iron or ecosystem structure must explain the gradient. We also explore variability in the remote sensed observations during the cruise. At the SAZ east station, there is high mesoscale variability with corresponding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15636940641316711482", "cites_id": ["15636940641316711482"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064511001639", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OiyNS6qSAdkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
