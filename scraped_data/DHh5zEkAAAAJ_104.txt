Ocean warming or circulation alterations induced by climate change has the potential to slowdown the rate of acidification of ocean waters by decreasing the amount of CO2 uptake by the ocean [2]. However, a recent study showed that climate change affected the decrease in pH insignificantly [3]. Here, we examine the sensitivity of future oceanic acidification to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model and find that ocean warming dominates the climate change feedbacks.Our results show that the direct decrease in pH due to ocean warming is approximately equal to but opposite in magnitude to the indirect increase in pH \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12430515540748423493", "cites_id": ["12430515540748423493"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1750-0680-1-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RVFITQYQgqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
