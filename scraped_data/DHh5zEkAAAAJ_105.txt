We explore the validity of the method in the Southern Ocean by directly comparing the CFC\u2010age derived estimates to values obtained using a multiparametric linear regression method over the same period. The agreement in anthropogenic CO2 accumulation between the two independent methods was very good (less than \u00b18%) for waters younger than 30 years. We found waters older than 30 years to significantly overestimate the decadal accumulation when using the CFC\u2010age method. This is mainly due to significant mixing biases when using CFCs to infer ages for these older waters [Sonnerup, 2001]. The CFC\u2010age method assumes a steady state circulation. CFC\u201011 variations on interannual timescales have been found to be relatively large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3939192003549953469", "cites_id": ["3939192003549953469"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003GB002089", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vX2nqUHSqjYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
