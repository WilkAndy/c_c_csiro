To estimate uncertainties, we made standard simulations in a diverse group of seven ocean models. Each model discretizes the ocean into a 3-D array of grid cells, and each includes a standard description of the inorganic ocean carbon cycle. Injection simulations with seven injection sites per run were made separately for three different depths. At 3000 m, all models retained at least 97% of the total injected CO2 at the end of the 100-year injection period; after 500 years, retention efficiency ranged from 48 to 82%. At 1500 m, retention efficiency was less (82-96% after 100 years; 28-57% after 500 years). At 800 m, it was less still (73-83% after 100 years; 15-38% after 500 years). For the 1500-m injection, San Francisco is generally the most efficient site, New York is the least efficient. For the 3000-m injection, differences between sites are smaller. Western boundary sites (New York and Tokyo) increased in efficiency more than other sites. In the 1500-m and 3000-m simulations, injected CO2 is lost mostly from the Southern Ocean, except for CO2 injected at 1500 m at New York, which is lost mostly from the North Atlantic."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3674738098943556152", "cites_id": ["3674738098943556152"], "pub_url": "https://awi.eprints-hosting.org/id/eprint/5296/1/Orr1999a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OPof1tRK_zIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
