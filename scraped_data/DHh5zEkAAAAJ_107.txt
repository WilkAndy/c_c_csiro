The Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) has been recently extended to include land and ocean carbon cycle components in its ACCESS-ESM1 version. A detailed description of ACCESS-ESM1 components including results from pre-industrial simulations is provided in Part 1. Here, we focus on the evaluation of ACCESS-ESM1 over the historical period (1850\u20132005) in terms of its capability to reproduce climate and carbon-related variables. Comparisons are performed with observations, if available, but also with other ESMs to highlight common weaknesses. We find that climate variables controlling the exchange of carbon are well reproduced. However, the aerosol forcing in ACCESS-ESM1 is somewhat larger than in other models, which leads to an overly strong cooling response in the land from about 1960 onwards. The land carbon cycle is evaluated for two scenarios: running with a prescribed leaf area index (LAI) and running with a prognostic LAI. We overestimate the seasonal mean (1.7 vs. 1.4) and peak amplitude (2.0 vs. 1.8) of the prognostic LAI at the global scale, which is common amongst CMIP5 ESMs. However, the prognostic LAI is our preferred choice, because it allows for the vegetation feedback through the coupling between LAI and the leaf carbon pool. Our globally integrated land\u2013atmosphere flux over the historical period is 98\u202fPgC for prescribed LAI and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:SrjOrk_WDzMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16526783829701494909", "cites_id": ["16526783829701494909"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/10/2591/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fQgHmVTuWuUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
