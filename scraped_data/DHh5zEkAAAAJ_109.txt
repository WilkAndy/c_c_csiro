However, the combination of processes that cause an accumulation of carbon within the ocean during glacial periods is still under debate. Here we present simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using the CSIRO Mk3L-COAL (Carbon\u2013Ocean\u2013Atmosphere\u2013Land) earth system model to test the contribution of physical and biogeochemical processes to ocean carbon storage. For the LGM simulation, we find a significant global cooling of the surface ocean (3.2\u202f\u00b0C) and the expansion of both minimum and maximum sea ice cover broadly consistent with proxy reconstructions. The glacial ocean stores an additional 267\u202fPg\u202fC in the deep ocean relative to the pre-industrial (PI) simulation due to stronger Antarctic Bottom Water formation. However, 889\u202fPg\u202fC is lost from the upper ocean via equilibration with a lower atmospheric CO2 concentration and a global decrease in export production, causing a net loss of carbon relative to the PI ocean. The LGM deep ocean also experiences an oxygenation (\u2009>\u2009\u202f100\u202fmmol\u202fO2\u202fm\u22123) and deepening of the calcite saturation horizon (exceeds the ocean bottom) at odds with proxy reconstructions. With modifications to key biogeochemical processes, which include an increased export of organic matter due to a simulated release from iron limitation, a deepening of remineralisation and decreased inorganic carbon export driven by cooler temperatures, we find that the carbon content of the glacial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:3u3nxgfnd-AC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16327182480299437450", "cites_id": ["16327182480299437450"], "pub_url": "https://cp.copernicus.org/preprints/cp-2016-73/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iq068fXNleIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 6}}
