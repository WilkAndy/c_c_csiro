Factors which are expected to be impacted include reproductive health, organism growth and species composition and distribution. Predicting when critical threshold values will be reached is crucial for projecting the future health of marine ecosystems and for marine resources planning and management. The impacts of ocean acidification will be first felt at the seasonal scale, however our understanding how seasonal variability will influence rates of future ocean acidification remains poorly constrained due to current model and data limitations. To address this issue, we first quantified the seasonal cycle of aragonite saturation state utilizing new data-based estimates of global ocean-surface dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity. This seasonality was then combined with earth system model projections under different emissions scenarios (representative concentration pathways; RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) to provide new insights into future aragonite undersaturation onset. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), our results suggest accounting for seasonality will bring forward the initial onset of month-long undersaturation by 17\u202f\u202f10 years compared to annual-mean estimates, with differences extending up to 35\u202f\u202f16 years in the North Pacific due to strong regional seasonality. This earlier onset will result in large-scale undersaturation once atmospheric CO reaches 496\u202fppm in the North Pacific and 511\u202fppm in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18356815652967026057", "cites_id": ["18356815652967026057"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/12/6017/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iQ1u6pOCwP4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
