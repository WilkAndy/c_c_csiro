The CFC age method is best suited to water younger than 30 years where CFC water ages are most reliable. For water younger than 30 years, the CFC\u201012 and CFC\u201011 age method can estimate the global 1980\u20131990 accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 to within 10% and 22%, respectively. With the exception of the Southern Ocean south of 50\u00b0S and the equatorial upwelling areas, these CFC\u2010derived estimates of the water column inventory of anthropogenic CO2 are within 10% of the simulated values. Our results suggest that the CFC age method provides another way of determining the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean. We applied the CFC age method to observed CFC data to estimate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:qqRC41JmxUcC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11594468574562455796", "cites_id": ["11594468574562455796"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2001GB001415", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9JA5Cr3T56AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
