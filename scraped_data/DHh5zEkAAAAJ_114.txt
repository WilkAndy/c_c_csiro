A one-dimensional advection-diffusion model was fitted to the data from each cruise to estimate vertical mixing (Kv) and upwelling velocity (w). With constant Kv and w, the average value of Kv and w was 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 cm2 s\u22121 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 m yr\u22121 respectively for the depth range 0\u2013900 m below the base of the mixed layer. This case produced Kv values that increased with time, and modeled CFC concentrations that were higher than observed in the upper 200 m and lower than observed in the deeper water (200\u2013900 m). Both of these conditions are consistent with Kv values that increased with depth. Fitting the one-dimensional advection-diffusion model to the data with Kv inversely related to the buoyancy frequency reduced the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13379502299368526715", "cites_id": ["13379502299368526715"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jmr/jmr/1997/00000055/00000003/art00004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:exNiIXSKrbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 7, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
