We explored carbon properties inside a large (~190 km diameter) cyclonic eddy that detached from the Subantarctic Front (SAF) south of Tasmania in March 2016. Based on remote sensing, the eddy was present for ~2 months in the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ), an important region of oceanic carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake throughout the annual cycle and carbon subduction (i.e., where mode and intermediate waters form), before it was reabsorbed into the SAF. The eddy was sampled during the middle of its life, 1 month after it spawned. Comparatively, the eddy was ~3\u00b0C colder, 0.5 practical salinity unit fresher, and less biologically productive than surrounding SAZ waters. The eddy was also richer in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and had lower saturation states of aragonite and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Afq3j1Mvmz0C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3725051012581665858", "cites_id": ["3725051012581665858"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GB005669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qqwj5ygKsjMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
