Evidence is accumulating to suggest ocean acidification may directly or indirectly affect many marine organisms and ecosystems, some of which may also hold significant social and economic value to the Australian community. This report card aims to provide a brief overview of the current state of scientific knowledge regarding the process of ocean acidification; current and future projected levels of ocean acidification; and, observed and projected impacts of current and future predicted levels of ocean acidification on marine organisms and ecosystems in the region. This Report Card also briefly discusses potential social and economic implications, policy challenges, and the key knowledge gaps needing to be addressed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15253835969795849496", "cites_id": ["15253835969795849496"], "pub_url": "https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/528669/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GP3BCf-CsNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
