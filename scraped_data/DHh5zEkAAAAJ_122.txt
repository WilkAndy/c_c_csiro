Here we identify and examine large\u2010scale baroclinically unstable waves occurring within waveguides associated with potential density gradients in the subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) oceans where the trade winds and westerlies meet and at depths associated with mode water formation. In contrast to the Northern Hemisphere subtropics, the SH pathways are more extensive allowing large\u2010scale coherent disturbances to communicate information westward from the midlatitudes to the subtropics (South Pacific Ocean) and from the subtropics to the tropics (Indian Ocean). Particular consideration is given to the subtropical South Pacific Ocean as this is a region where resonant interactions between large\u2010scale Rossby waves and significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1006546044126315672", "cites_id": ["1006546044126315672"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014JC009990", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mEQ5Ukv49w0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 1}}
