In this perspective, we use forecasts of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern-Oscillation to outline the impact of bias-correction on skill. Many assessments of skill from hindcasts (past forecasts) are probably overestimates of attainable forecast skill because the hindcasts are informed by observations over the period assessed that would not be available to real forecasts. Differences between hindcast and forecast skill result from changes in model biases from the period used to form forecast anomalies to the period over which the forecast is made. The relative skill rankings of models can change between hindcast and forecast systems because different models have different changes in bias across periods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:vkG2KsohqNgC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=699699864711807198", "cites_id": ["699699864711807198"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23771-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3kCJ3VHVtQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
