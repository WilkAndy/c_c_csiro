Model drift, partially related to insufficient model spin-up, imperfect model physics or bias in surface forcing, can be problematic, leading to contamination of climate change signals. In this study, we adapt a near-global eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model, originally developed for short-range ocean forecasting, for climate studies. The Ocean Forecasting Australia Model version 3 (OFAM3) is spun up for 20 years, with repeated year 1979 forcing and adaptive relaxation (Newtonian nudging) of temperature and salinity in the deep ocean to an observation-based climatology. In addition, surface heat fluxes from the JRA-55 atmospheric reanalysis are adjusted during the spin-up experiment to minimise excessive net heat uptake in the ocean. In the historical experiment, spanning 1979\u20132014, a non-adaptive relaxation is applied by repeating the same relaxation rates derived from the last five years of the spin-up experiment, and the surface heat flux adjustment diagnosed during the spinup experiment is also maintained. We demonstrate that the historical experiment driven by the JRA-55 reanalysis does not have significant drifts (e.g., as shown by simulated global ocean heat content), and also provides an eddy-resolving simulation of the global ocean circulation over the period 1979\u20132014. Decadal changes, such as the strengthening of the subtropical gyre circulation, are also reasonably simulated.
