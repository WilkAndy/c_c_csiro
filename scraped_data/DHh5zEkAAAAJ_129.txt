Total phytoplankton biomass was prescribed from the Sea\u2010viewing Wide Field\u2010of\u2010view Sensor (SeaWiFS) estimates, and we included two phytoplankton types, diatoms and nondiatoms. We set the nondiatoms N/P uptake ratio to 16 while the diatoms N/P and N/Si ratios were determined by fitting the observed seasonal nitrate, phosphate, and silicate cycle in the mixed layer. The best model fit to the observations required an annual N/P utilization ratio of 13.2, but this low N/P ratio still overestimated the nitrate utilization during the summer. We considered three mechanisms for improving the simulated nitrate cycle: (1) seasonal variation in the N/P ratio of the horizontal nutrient supply to the PFZ, (2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6330095404751351855", "cites_id": ["6330095404751351855"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002GB001938", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L3CJejsE2VcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
