This analysis characterizes the abilities of these models to ventilate the ocean on timescales relevant for anthropogenic CO2 uptake. We found a large range in the modeled global inventory (\u00b130%), mainly due to differences in ventilation from the high latitudes. In the Southern Ocean, models differ particularly in the longitudinal distribution of the CFC uptake in the intermediate water, whereas the latitudinal distribution is mainly controlled by the subgrid-scale parameterization. Models with isopycnal diffusion and eddy-induced velocity parameterization produce more realistic intermediate water ventilation. Deep and bottom water ventilation also varies substantially between the models. Models coupled to a sea-ice model systematically provide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 268, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15327100433079930114", "cites_id": ["15327100433079930114"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500301000130", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ag13LqPMtNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 9, "2002": 10, "2003": 17, "2004": 27, "2005": 24, "2006": 23, "2007": 23, "2008": 13, "2009": 15, "2010": 10, "2011": 14, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
