Weather and climate play an important role in modulating wildfire activity. We explore the joint occurrence of global fire weather and meteorological drought using a compound events framework. We show that, for much of the globe, burned area increases when periods of heightened fire weather compound with dry antecedent conditions. Regions associated with wildfire disasters, such as southern Australia and the western USA, are prone to experiencing years of compound drought and fire weather. Such compound events have increased in frequency for much of the globe, driven primarily by increases in fire weather rather than changes in precipitation. El Nio Southern Oscillation is associated with widespread, spatially compounding drought and fire weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, a La Nia signature is evident, whereas El Nio is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:TAkmkrPVePIC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1290450741789192353", "cites_id": ["1290450741789192353"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-022-00248-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ofB70Bya6BEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 16}}
