Exceptionally hot and dry weather conditions, and preceding years of severe drought across Australia, contributed to the severity of the wildfires. Here we present analysis of a very large ensemble of initialized climate simulations to assess the likelihood of the concurrent drought and fire-weather conditions experienced at that time. We focus on a large region in southeast Australia where these fires were most widespread and define two indices to quantify the susceptibility to fire from drought and fire weather. Both indices were unprecedented in the observed record in 2019. We find that the likelihood of experiencing such extreme susceptibility to fire in the current climate was 0.5%, equivalent to a 200 year \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:uk0w_JccWH8C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8954671856619346248", "cites_id": ["8954671856619346248"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-021-00220-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SNn7FZxiRXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 10, "2023": 10}}
