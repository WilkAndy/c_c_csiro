In the Tasman Sea, the SAZ displays a unique and large zonal gradient in the surface chlorophyll concentrations. In situ measurements show higher dissolved iron in the east than in the west which could explain the zonal chlorophyll gradient. To assess and quantify the major sources of iron in this region, we use an eddy-resolving model to simulate the dissolved Fe distribution arising from both the shelf and the dust supply of iron. The simulation showed that dissolved Fe from the shelf is only transported eastward to about 155\u00b0E and the shelf source of dissolved iron is unable to supply iron to the entire Tasman Sea SAZ region even when we assume that there no iron losses. The simulation with the atmospheric source of iron showed that through a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:yyP9NS4UN-AC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=524141746563145547", "cites_id": ["524141746563145547"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064511001627", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S1_ZNyQgRgcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 11, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
