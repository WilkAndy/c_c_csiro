This storage is being enhanced as the water containing the anthropogenic CO2 is being mixed into the deeper ocean at about 30 m yr\u22121. A carbon-cycle model of the North Pacific Ocean is used to produce scenarios for a point source of CO2 discharged off Japan at 1 GtC yr\u22121 at depths varying from 600 to 5,200 m. Probable lapsed time for the disposed CO2 to return to the surface is found to be 20 to 100 years for disposal depths of 600 to 1,200 m respectively. Highly stratified waters, e.g. in the northeast Pacific Ocean, will delay CO2 return because low diffusivity will minimize ventilation of the deeper water the the surface. The neutralization of anthropogenic CO2 in the upper 250 m of the North Pacific is limited by the low reservoir of about 60 GtC of carbonate ions, now being \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3543714830347670219", "cites_id": ["3543714830347670219"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0196890493900315", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yxIo4NzNLTEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
