To account for unresolved mesoscale variability in our simulations, we used summer and winter cruises to determine the magnitude of this variability and estimate its impact on the air\u2013sea fluxes. From our analysis, we propose a regular sampling strategy of every 6\u00b0 in latitude and 10\u00b0 in longitude every 3 months for the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Applying this sampling strategy to the simulation returned an annual mean air\u2013sea flux value within \u00b115% of the total simulated value, when applied now and into the future. Our study highlights several key points for measuring annual mean basin-scale CO2 fluxes: (1) the combination of temporal and spatial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3727547786982924551", "cites_id": ["3727547786982924551"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096706450800430X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ByFpfvboujMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
