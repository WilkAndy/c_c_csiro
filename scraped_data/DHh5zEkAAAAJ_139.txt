The primary focus will be on CO2 scenarios for North Pacific intermediate water (NPIW) and the deep water off the Japanese coast. CO2 chemistry shows that pCO2 values in the intermediate and deep North Pacific waters are already higher than the present atmospheric CO2 level. The factors maintaining high pCO2 in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean are (1) ocean diffusivity, (2) penetration and mixing into deeper water, (3) transport of NPIW, (4) deep Pacific circulation, and (5) the efficiency of the biological pump. Review of recent work on ventilation of deep Pacific waters suggests a mid-depth return flow to Antarctic circumpolar water, increasing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6404480966178080148", "cites_id": ["6404480966178080148"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X97100496", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lIXLn4FJ4VgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
