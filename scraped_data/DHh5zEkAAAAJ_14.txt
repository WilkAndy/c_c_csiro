Model\u2010data comparisons are presented for sea surface temperature and salinity, seasonal mixed layer depth, meridional heat and freshwater transport, 3\u2010D hydrographic fields, and meridional overturning. Considerable variation exists among the OCMIP\u20102 simulations, with some of the solutions falling noticeably outside available observational constraints. For some cases, model\u2010model and model\u2010data differences can be related to variations in surface forcing, subgrid\u2010scale parameterizations, and model architecture. These errors in the physical metrics point to significant problems in the underlying model representations of ocean transport and dynamics, problems that directly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:-qiMcZ-2Z0YC", "num_citations": 260, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7974822251050818869", "cites_id": ["7974822251050818869"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003gb002150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nd3DvJVCrG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 21, "2006": 21, "2007": 23, "2008": 16, "2009": 20, "2010": 14, "2011": 9, "2012": 16, "2013": 19, "2014": 21, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
