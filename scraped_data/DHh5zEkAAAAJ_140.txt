One currently implemented MOC observation system uses temperature and salinity (as well as other) observations along a zonal transect in the North Atlantic. The resulting MOC estimate has, however, a relatively low signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio due to large internal variability and observation errors. Observations of hydrographic tracers that are mechanistically linked to MOC changes may increase the signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio. A MOC slowdown is associated in model simulations with a shoaling of the boundary between North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. This shoaling results in detectable trends in water mass tracers. Here we deploy a virtual observation array into a numerical model starting in model year 2006 to test \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12274966935652427388", "cites_id": ["12274966935652427388"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007JC004113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fGY6dWRxWaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
