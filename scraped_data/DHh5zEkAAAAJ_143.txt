However, the existence of biases in the present\u2010day coupled model SSTs implies that SST future warming patterns may also be biased. Models with large biases in tropical Pacific SST simulate warming that does not align with the observed cold tongue, producing a dynamically unrealistic pattern when added to observed SSTs. We demonstrate that projections of precipitation are highly sensitive to the warming pattern of SSTs by using idealized annually forced atmospheric model experiments. Simple bias adjustment of the warming pattern is applied, leading to precipitation changes that are around 60% weaker in the Western Tropical Pacific.
