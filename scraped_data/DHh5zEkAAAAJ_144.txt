The recent study by Oke and Sakov (2012) uses a combination of historical satellite imagery, and numerical model output to assess the footprint of physical variables in regional observing system. However, in the absence of long integrations of marine biogeochemical models, there are very few tools to interpret the biological dynamics that may be captured by a regional observing system. In this study, a generic approach to assess the biological footprint of regional observing systems is developed. We used the recently reprocessed gridded chlorophyll-a product (NASA OC3M algorithm) to estimate the spatial footprint of the biological observations of the Australian Integrated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3249033608569700571", "cites_id": ["3249033608569700571"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796314002504", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:20AaVtriFi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
