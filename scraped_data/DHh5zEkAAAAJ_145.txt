To assess the models, simulations of natural \u0394 14C  and excess CO2 (defined as the increase in carbon in the ocean caused by the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere) were compared to observations. For both natural \u0394 14C  and excess CO2 the Southern Ocean (SO) was the region most sensitive to model numerics and eddy parameterizations. To produce realistic distributions of \u0394 14C  and excess CO2 the simulated oceanic anthropogenic CO2 uptake tracked the minimum range of the modeled anthropogenic CO2 uptakes. Models with higher uptake estimates produced too much excess CO2 in the ocean and over-ventilated the deepwater of the SO.
