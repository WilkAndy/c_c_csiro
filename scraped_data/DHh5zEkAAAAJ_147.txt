The accompanying effects on the CO2 flux outside the SO are less certain. We performed idealized model simulations to separate the transient effects of SO carbon pumps on nutrients, primary production, and CO2 flux outside the SO. The SO biological carbon pump leads to dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrient reduction at the surface and in the exported water masses, and to a dissolved inorganic carbon increase at depth through the sinking of organic matter. When primary production is suppressed in the SO, only 30% of SO export, 43% of SO net primary production, and 50% of biologically driven SO CO2 flux are compensated outside the SO on a 200\u2010year time scale. In contrast, when the abiotically driven CO2 flux is suppressed, 90% of CO2 outgassing in the SO is compensated by air\u2010sea \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:ax16qXk-rEQC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11533110622299655283", "cites_id": ["11533110622299655283"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GB005977", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c4x0hQHXDaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
