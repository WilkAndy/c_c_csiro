CAFE60v1 has been designed with the intention of simultaneously generating both initial conditions for multiyear climate forecasts and a large ensemble retrospective analysis of the global climate system from 1960 to the present. Strongly coupled data assimilation (SCDA) is implemented via an ensemble transform Kalman filter in order to constrain a general circulation climate model to observations. Satellite (altimetry, sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration) and in situ ocean temperature and salinity profiles are directly assimilated each month, whereas atmospheric observations are subsampled from the JRA-55 atmospheric reanalysis. Strong coupling is implemented via explicit cross-domain covariances between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:cTdzRpWJKHEC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14590797083214042114", "cites_id": ["14590797083214042114"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/13/JCLI-D-20-0974.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AlTHTqTsfMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
