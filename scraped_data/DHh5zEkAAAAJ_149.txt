The study by McCauley et al.(2017) published on the 23 June 2017 is the first large-scale field experiment on the impact of seismic activity on zooplankton. Their study overturns the conventional idea of limited and localised impact on zooplankton. They found that airgun exposure significantly decreased zooplankton abundance, and increased the mortality rate from a natural level of 19% per day to 45% per day (on the day of exposure). These impacts were observed out to the maximum assessed range of 1.2 km. McCauley et al.(2017) state that there is an urgent need to conduct further studies to mitigate, model and understand potential impacts on plankton.Methods: Here we simulate the large-scale impact of a seismic survey on zooplankton, assuming the mortality rate associated with airgun exposure reported by McCauley et al.(2017). Our approach models a hypothetical survey on the edge of the Northwest Shelf during summer. The survey area was 80 km by 36 km in water 300-800 m deep and the survey was conducted over 35 days. To simulate the movement of zooplankton by currents, we 0.5 million particles into a hydrodynamic model (CSIRO\u2019s Ocean Forecast Australia Model). Zooplankton particles could be hit multiple times by the airgun if they were carried by currents into the future survey path. Each particle represents a zooplankton population exhibiting logistic population growth. The greatest limitation in this approach was accurate knowledge of the natural growth and mortality rates of zooplankton \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Fp1gVP7Oym8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4311867318841545109", "cites_id": ["4311867318841545109"], "pub_url": "https://www.appea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SeismicPlankton_FinalReport.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lZEqMnvU1jsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
