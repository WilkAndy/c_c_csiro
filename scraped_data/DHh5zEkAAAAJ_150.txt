Here we develop and apply a diagnostic tool that provides a volumetric stream function in (CA,\u03c30) coordinates to calculate the total diapycnal CA transport in the ocean, where \u03c30 is the surface referenced potential density anomaly. We combine this with air\u2010sea fluxes of CA to infer the internal ocean mixing of CA to obtain a closed globally integrated budget analyses of the ocean's CA transport. This diagnostic separates the contribution from the mean flow, seasonal cycles, trend, surface fluxes, and mixing in the distribution and the accumulation of CA in the ocean. We find that the redistribution of CA from the surface to the interior of the ocean is due to an interplay between circulation and mixing.
