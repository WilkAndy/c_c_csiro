The inverse model used geostrophy and a linear \u03b2-plane vorticity equation as dynamical constraints. The conservation of mass and the steady-state advection\u2013diffusion equations for temperature and salinity were used to form a set of equations from which the reference level velocities and mixing terms were determined. Additional constraints were included in the model by forcing the horizontal velocity from the model to be consistent with bouy data from the near surface."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15097395703373856180", "cites_id": ["15097395703373856180"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/23/4/1520-0485_1993_023_0648_cwtosa_2_0_co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tH0bHWe5hNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 4, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
