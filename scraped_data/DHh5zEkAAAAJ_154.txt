Our ultimate goal is to minimize any impacts associated with the eventual use of ocean carbon sequestration to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The project will continue through March 31, 2002, with a field experiment to take place in the summer of 2001 off the Kona Coast of Hawaii. At GHGT-4 in Interlaken, we presented a paper detailing our plans. The purpose of this paper is to present an update on our progress to date and our plans to complete the project. The co-authors of this paper are members of the project\u2019s Technical Committee, which has been formed to supervise the technical aspects and execution of this project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=761349559535220141", "cites_id": ["761349559535220141"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=472ed7d93d6d4e80b7a5de0b2fa0caf69f228287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rTX__WPbkAoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
