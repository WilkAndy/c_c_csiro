In order to investigate the source of errors in remotely-sensed Chl-a concentration we obtained in situ bio-optical properties, in situ reflectances, satellite-derived reflectances and the Chl-a concentration satellite products of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) Instrument on board Sentinel-3 A in waters off eastern Australia. The mesoscale eddies of these oligotrophic waters provide contrasting phytoplankton communities that allowed us to focus on the effect of phytoplankton size as a source of errors. In these waters, cold-core cyclonic eddies (CE) are dominated by large phytoplankton cells, while small cells dominate warm-core anticyclonic eddies (ACE). The chlorophyll-specific absorption and backscattering from contrasting sites show significant difference due \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:sRzLl6AghiAC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14338695805571935476", "cites_id": ["14338695805571935476"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796320300968", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Kx_kd1H_cYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
