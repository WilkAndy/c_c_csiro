The HNLC conditions become more prominent moving south from the Sub-Antarctic Zone, with surface chlorophyll generally decreasing and nitrate increasing with latitude. Parameter optimisation experiments were performed using simulated annealing to fit a zero-dimensional nitrogen-based four-component ecosystem model to SeaWiFS surface chlorophyll data in the Sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ), Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and Antarctic Zone (AZ). We hypothesise that bioavailability of iron limits phytoplankton growth in this region. A physiological indicator of iron availability was investigated by optimising three of the model parameters defining maximum photosynthetic growth and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3440129844317433430", "cites_id": ["3440129844317433430"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796313001012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vq7C593LvS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
