Injection was made simultaneously at seven separate sites; separate 7-site simulations were made for injection at 800 m, 1500 m, and 3000 m. For injection at 3000 m, all models showed 85% or greater global efficiency in year 2200\u2014that is, 100 years after the end of the specified 100-year injection period; at the same time, the 1500-m injection is 60-80% efficient and 800-m injection is only 42-61% efficient. Most of the CO2 injected at 3000 m was lost from the Southern Ocean (the principal region by which the deep ocean is ventilated); at shallower depths, relatively more was lost sooner, from the northern hemisphere and the tropics. The simulated global injection efficiency at 3000 m is correlated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10239834193240032317", "cites_id": ["10239834193240032317"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080442761502774", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PYT4HvIyG44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
