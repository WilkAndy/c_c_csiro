These transport matrices enable highly efficient calculation of deep-water tracer fields that otherwise require long integrations with forward time-stepping ocean models. Comparisons of matrix solutions for ideal mean water age demonstrate that the transport matrices are reasonably accurate representations of the transport in the parent ocean models.Tracer fields calculated using transport matrices provide simple circulation metrics that can be compared to observations. We compare matrix-computed radiocarbon distributions from two versions of ACCESS ocean models with observations. We find matrices based on both models produce realistic circulations; the radiocarbon distribution based on ACCESS forced with CORE climatology fits observations better in the deep \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:7eciy3tyNvQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1234521249456109167", "cites_id": ["1234521249456109167"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500318300891", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b7aAHYnmIREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
