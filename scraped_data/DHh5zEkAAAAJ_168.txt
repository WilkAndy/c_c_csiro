This paper analyzes sea ice volume in 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model configurations under pre\u2010industrial and historical climate forcings, to compare the relative importance of ice motion and thermodynamic processes. We find that the models' responses to historical forcings is dependent on their sea ice motion formulation; models with low\u2010magnitude sea ice motion tend to have historical trends that are dominated by thermodynamic processes, while sea ice models with higher\u2010magnitude motion have more spatially variable relative contributions from dynamic and thermodynamic processes. Trends at the sea ice edge during the season of sea ice advance are generally dominated by dynamic processes, whereas during retreat thermodynamic trends \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:5MWWCdJses0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10758733575268359993", "cites_id": ["10758733575268359993"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JC014177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OV_wOi-zTpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
