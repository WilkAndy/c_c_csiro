Here, a two size-class phytoplankton biogeochemical model, with a 0D configuration, was used to simulate the surface chlorophyll-a dynamics (simulated surface Chl-a) for cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies off East Australia. An optical model was then used to calculate the inherent optical properties from the simulation and convert them into remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). Subsequently, Rrs was used to produce a satellite-like estimate of the simulated surface Chl-a concentrations through the MODIS OC3M algorithm (simulated OC3M Chl-a). Identical parameter optimisation experiments were performed through the assimilation of the two separate datasets (simulated surface Chl-a and simulated OC3M Chl-a), with the purpose of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:3eH_u9Md8IkC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=558582352430077699", "cites_id": ["558582352430077699"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796317303081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A5dlprB7wAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
