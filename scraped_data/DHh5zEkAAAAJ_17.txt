Unlike most other inference methods, the TTD method does not assume a single ventilation time and avoids the large uncertainty incurred by attempts to correct for the large natural carbon background in dissolved inorganic carbon measurements. The highest concentrations and deepest penetration of anthropogenic carbon are found in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. The estimated total inventory in 1994 is 134 Pg-C. To evaluate uncertainties the TTD method is applied to output from an ocean general circulation model (OGCM) and compared the results to the directly simulated Cant. Outside of the Southern Ocean the predicted Cant closely matches the directly simulated distribution, but in the Southern Ocean the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 231, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16447215184696800715", "cites_id": ["16447215184696800715"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2006.00222.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y3VDxBE_QOQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 14, "2009": 23, "2010": 25, "2011": 16, "2012": 15, "2013": 15, "2014": 6, "2015": 17, "2016": 20, "2017": 15, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 16, "2023": 4}}
