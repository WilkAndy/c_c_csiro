We use 12 years of modeled data from a coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model and an Eulerian\u2010Lagrangian approach to quantify nitrate supply to the GAB and the region between the GAB and the Subantarctic Australian Front (GAB\u2010SAFn), identify phytoplankton growth within the GAB, and ascertain the source of nitrate that fuels it. We find that nitrate concentrations have a decorrelation timescale of \u223c60 days; since most of the water from surrounding oceans takes longer than 60 days to reach the GAB, 23% and 75% of nitrate used by phytoplankton to grow are sourced within the GAB and from the GAB\u2010SAFn, respectively. Thus, most of the nitrate is recycled locally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:pf0VL3QzzAAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4082941622102953853", "cites_id": ["4082941622102953853"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017JC013542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fY8a4MWFqTgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
