These data reveal at least six striking spikes in chlorophyll in October through December, with approximately 2 week periodicity, that coincide with the 5 development of the fall Wyrtki jets during the transition between the summer and winter monsoons. Concurrent meteorological and in situ physical measurements from the mooring reveal that the chlorophyll pulses are associated with intensification of eastward winds at the surface and eastward currents in the mixed layer. These observations are inconsistent with upwelling dynamics as occurs in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 10 since eastward winds that force Wyrtki jet intensification should drive downwelling. The chlorophyll spikes could be explained by two alternative mechanisms:(1) turbulent entrainment of nutrients and/or chlorophyll from across the base of the mixed layer by wind stirring or Wyrtki jet-induced shear instability; or (2) enhanced horizontal advection of high chlorophyll concentrations into the convergent equatorial zone. The first 15 mechanism is supported by the phasing and amplitude of the relationship between wind stress and chlorophyll, which suggests that the chlorophyll spikes are the result of turbulent entrainment driven by synoptic zonal wind events. The second mechanism is supported by satellite chlorophyll observations that reveal a clear connection between the increased chlorophyll concentrations at the mooring location and larger-scale 20 topographic wake effects from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18178692819692422253", "cites_id": ["18178692819692422253"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/69067510/ada9d144cb78642e0fcc20ca66fad977661b.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bQS2_s2wR_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
