One source of uncertainty in retrieved Chl-a products can be related to large photosynthetic cells, characterised by lower mass-specific absorption coefficients due to increased packaging effect. Here, we explore the relationship between phytoplankton size structure and an ocean colour product using optical simulations and in situ observations. Specifically, we use an optical model to explore how phytoplankton cell size and abundance influence phytoplankton absorption and backscattering coefficients and the implication this has for water leaving radiance and the estimated Chl-a derived from satellite ocean colour. The optical model simulations show phytoplankton cell size has a significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:CUz-cjXBMXMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16661645228898870115", "cites_id": ["16661645228898870115"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092479632030155X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y2MZ-g4OOucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
