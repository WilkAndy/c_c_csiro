A matrix formulation of advection\u2010diffusion is used to quantify transport into the ocean interior and from the interior back to the surface. We compute the ocean volumes last ventilated at the surface, as well as the volumes next reexposed to the atmosphere, per unit area, and the distributions of water in transit between key ventilation regions. We find that for the 2090s circulation, Antarctic Bottom Water formation and Antarctic ventilation have collapsed but are compensated by increased mode water formation and ventilation at the poleward edge of the southern subtropical gyres. Reexposure of deep water back to the atmosphere in the Antarctic Southern Ocean is also reduced but compensated by enhanced reexposure in the subpolar Southern Ocean.
