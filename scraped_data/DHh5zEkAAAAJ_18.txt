The optimization is used to directly determine the model parameters required to reproduce the observed data. The optimization routine is formulated in a general manner and is easily modified to include additional information on both the desired model output and the model parameters. From the optimization routine, error analysis of the optimal parameters is provided by the error-covariance matrix which gives both the sensitivity of the model to each model parameter and the correlation coefficients between all pairs of model parameters. In addition, the optimization analysis provides a means of assessing the necessary model complexity required to model the available data. To demonstrate the technique, optimal parameters of three different ecosystem model configurations are determined from nitrate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 226, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13737336290195831419", "cites_id": ["13737336290195831419"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jmr/jmr/1995/00000053/00000004/art00003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e3o0iZLSpL4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 11, "2000": 8, "2001": 14, "2002": 10, "2003": 19, "2004": 6, "2005": 12, "2006": 10, "2007": 8, "2008": 10, "2009": 10, "2010": 10, "2011": 10, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 5, "2015": 13, "2016": 4, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 10}}
