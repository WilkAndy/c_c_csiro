However, due to the complexity of these global climate models they are formulated at relatively low spatial resolution (eg, typically between 1 and 2 degrees). Therefore, they do not provide sufficient spatial resolution to make useful regional climate change projections. Further, these GCMs fail to capture important features of ocean circulation (eg boundary currents and mesoscale eddies) that are important to how climate change will impact marine systems.To produce regional climate change projections, it is necessary to apply downscaling techniques to the GCM output. In the case of the atmosphere, Regional Atmospheric Models (RAMs) have a long history of being used to dynamically downscale global weather predictions to provide regional scale predictions (eg Lo et al., 2008) and now these dynamical downscaling techniques are being modified and applied to make regional climate change projections (Wang et al., 2004). Although dynamical downscaling of GCMs using RAMs is common (Laprise et al., 2008) there are few examples of dynamical downscaling of climate change projections for the ocean environment. The few published studies have focused on small regional seas like the Baltic and North Seas (Adlandsvik 2008; Meier 2006). Our dynamical downscaling effort is much more ambitious in that we will provide downscaled climate change projections for the entire Australian region for both physical and biogeochemical fields (ie Nitrate, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Detritus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9165032450338245793", "cites_id": ["9165032450338245793"], "pub_url": "https://wamsi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/2021/01/Project-2.2-Dynamic-downscaling-of-climate-change-projections.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ocxWhXS8MH8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
