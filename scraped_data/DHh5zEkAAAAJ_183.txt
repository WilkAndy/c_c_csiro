Satellite ocean color algorithms have been used for over 20 years, providing a substantial historical record of global ocean chlorophyll\u2010a variability. Current chlorophyll algorithms perform better in the tropical Pacific than for the globe. Nevertheless, improvements can be made to produce a robust historical record of chlorophyll variability, which is essential to accurately identify ocean\u2010atmosphere carbon fluxes and long\u2010term trends in ocean productivity. We use a large in situ chlorophyll database to tune empirical ocean color algorithms to reduce bias in the equatorial Pacific. Traditional band ratio chlorophyll algorithms (OCx) perform adequately but exhibit errors at low chlorophyll concentrations. A new algorithm, the Ocean Color Index (OCI; Hu et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007395), is more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:lVu93_cgYy4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9572141208937173137", "cites_id": ["9572141208937173137"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JC015498", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kRCU0rYT14QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
