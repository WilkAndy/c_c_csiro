The current human-induced increase of CO2 in the atmosphere (~ 1.1 ppmV/year) is about a hundred times faster than at the most rapid climate transitions of the Quaternary. About half the anthropogenic carbon dioxide has now dissolved into the ocean. A geochemical consequence of this carbon dioxide input is a lowering of pH in the surface ocean and a reduction in the concentration of dissolved carbonate ions, the chemical component used by many marine organisms to produce calcium carbonate shells. With the expected doubling of carbon dioxide over pre-industrial levels within this century, the anticipated drop in carbonate ion will be about three times greater than that experienced during the last deglaciation.A research agenda for understanding the impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems and biodiversity is urgently needed in order to anticipate and prepare for the effects. Crucial unanswered question include: how will ocean acidification affect marine ecosystems? How will calcification rates in carbonate shell producers be altered? Will changes in planktonic production affect higher trophic levels including fish? What are the thresholds in carbonate chemistry beyond which calcifiers like coral can no longer produce carbonate?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10798578526997327305", "cites_id": ["10798578526997327305"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/75188/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yS3W_PRB3JUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
