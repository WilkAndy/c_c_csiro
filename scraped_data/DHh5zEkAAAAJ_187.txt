They concluded that coral calcification is already compromised and predicted further declines through the 21st Century. We took this a step further [McNeil et al., 2004](herein referred to as MMB04) by using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model that takes into account future changes in arag due to rising sea surface temperature (SST), changes in ocean circulation and changes in oceanic biological activity. We also took into account increases in calcification that may be expected due to rising SST by using in-situ evidence. In their response to our paper, Kleypas et al.[2005](herein referred to as K05) seek to discredit our finding that coral reef calcification may increase through the 21st Century."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10163137422984918365", "cites_id": ["10163137422984918365"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/49888619/2005gl02260420161026-6568-1xuftgj.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XbV-vKO3Co0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2}}
