When used in tandem, they provide powerful insight into physical and biogeochemical processes. Here, we detail the implementation of \u03b413C and \u03b415N in the ocean component of an Earth system model. We evaluate our simulated \u03b413C and \u03b415N against contemporary measurements, place the model's performance alongside other isotope-enabled models and document the response of \u03b413C and \u03b415N to changes in ecosystem functioning. The model combines the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark 3L (CSIRO Mk3L) climate system model with the Carbon of the Ocean, Atmosphere and Land (COAL) biogeochemical model. The oceanic component of CSIRO Mk3L-COAL has a resolution of 1.6\u2218 latitude\u2009\u00d7\u20092.8\u2218 longitude and resolves multimillennial timescales, running at a rate of \u223c400 years per day. We show that this coarse-resolution, computationally efficient model adequately reproduces water column and core-top \u03b413C and \u03b415N measurements, making it a useful tool for palaeoceanographic research. Changes to ecosystem function involve varying phytoplankton stoichiometry, varying CaCO3 production based on calcite saturation state and varying N2 fixation via iron limitation. We find that large changes in CaCO3 production have little effect on \u03b413C and \u03b415N, while changes in N2 fixation and phytoplankton stoichiometry have substantial and complex effects. Interpretations of palaeoceanographic records are therefore open to multiple lines of interpretation where multiple processes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:MU1jWE1llqsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12430662263857351864", "cites_id": ["12430662263857351864"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/1491/2019/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uAwS8HeVgqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
