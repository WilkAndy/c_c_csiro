Our analysis suggests that the ocean stored 14.8 petagrams of anthropogenic carbon from mid-1980 to mid-1989 and 17.9 petagrams of carbon from mid-1990 to mid-1999, indicating an oceanwide net uptake of 1.6 and 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, respectively. Our results provide an upper limit on the solubility-driven anthropogenic CO2 flux into the ocean, and they suggest that most ocean general circulation models are overestimating oceanic anthropogenic CO2 uptake over the past two decades."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:_UIRw3K-QSMC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18094518058387538619", "cites_id": ["18094518058387538619"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1077429", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u4IUJE6kHPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 9, "2004": 19, "2005": 9, "2006": 19, "2007": 22, "2008": 16, "2009": 19, "2010": 15, "2011": 14, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 6}}
