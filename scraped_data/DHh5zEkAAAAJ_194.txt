The field of data assimilation is well known in both meteorology and physical oceanography where it routinely provides the tool to make short-term forecasts of weather and upper ocean currents [Ghil and Malanotte-Rizzoli, 1991, Thacker, 1988; Tziperman and Thacker, 1989a]. At present, a comprehensive international program (Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment) is being developed and implemented to build a real time ocean prediction system [                 http://www.usgodae.fnmoc.navy.mil/                                ].
