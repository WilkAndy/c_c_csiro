On monthly intervals, the price of many commodities produced predominantly in tropical regions covary with the dominant mode of climate variability in this region, namely the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, for the spot prices returns of vegetable oils produced in Asia, we develop autoregressive (AR) models with exogenous ENSO indices, where for the first time these indices are generated by a purpose-built state-of-the-art general circulation model (GCM) climate forecasting system. The GCM is a numerical simulation which couples together the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice, with the initial conditions tailored to maximize the climate forecast skill at multiyear timescales in the tropics. To serve as additional benchmarks, we also test commodity forecasts using: (a) no ENSO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:boGf3zyra0UC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3686469972228768231", "cites_id": ["3686469972228768231"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science/article/forecasting-commodity-returns-by-exploiting-climate-model-forecasts-of-the-el-nino-southern-oscillation/DDFF5839AA65ADD1FDCDC2404E690525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5wHXcej4KDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
