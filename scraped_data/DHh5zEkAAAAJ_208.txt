A model that performs well in regards to both those constraints will be more likely to simulate reasonable global injection efficiencies. Nonetheless, efficiencies for a given injection site in coarse resolution models could be biased. For instance, the majority of injection sites will be located on eastern or western boundaries, which have known problems in coarse resolution models. Furthermore, coarse-resolution grids are unable to resolve important subgrid-scale processes (e.g., eddies, boundary currents, convection). Properly accounting for these processes may affect large-scale transport and could alter model predictions of CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16616282285889400187", "cites_id": ["16616282285889400187"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080447049501683", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e60NwrPkmOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
