A common, simple biogeochemical model is utilized in different coarse\u2010resolution ocean circulation models. The model mean (\u00b11\u03c3) downward flux of organic matter across 75 m depth is 17 \u00b1 6 Pg C yr\u22121. Model means of globally averaged particle export, the fraction of total export in dissolved form, surface semilabile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and seasonal net outgassing (SNO) of oxygen are in good agreement with observation\u2010based estimates, but particle export and surface DOC are too high in the tropics. There is a high sensitivity of the results to circulation, as evidenced by (1) the correlation of surface DOC and export with circulation metrics, including chlorofluorocarbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 216, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2463036684274725396", "cites_id": ["2463036684274725396"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006gb002857", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FHLzitB2LiIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 18, "2009": 25, "2010": 18, "2011": 12, "2012": 12, "2013": 23, "2014": 12, "2015": 19, "2016": 6, "2017": 13, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
