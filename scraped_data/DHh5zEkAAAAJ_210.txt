To study the response of the ocean-climate system to this climate perturbation, investigators have integrated ocean-climate models with an atmospheric CO2 concentration that rises over time to double, triple or quadruple the control CO2 level [Bi et al., 2001; Hirst, 1999; Manabe and Stouffer, 1993; Goosse and Renssen, 2001]. The oceanic response in these experiments typically includes widespread surface warming, retreat of sea ice and a general increase in upper ocean stratification, all of which may impact upon the ocean biogeochemistry. The substantial reductions in formation rate and/or density of intermediate and deep water masses that occur in these simulations would likely affect biogeochemical cycling in the ocean and the air-sea exchange of oxygen and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9070124213657601597", "cites_id": ["9070124213657601597"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-2087-2_9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PQa7r-qN330J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
