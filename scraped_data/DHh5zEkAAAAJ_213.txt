Climate change is putting the fundamental needs of ocean dependent Pacific communities at risk, including living space and housing, food and water security, culture, health and wellbeing. Pollution and marine waste, population growth, resource over-exploitation and overfishing, invasive species, damage to key ecosystems, and coastal development are all magnifying the effects of climate change. Flexible management systems and adaption projects which build climate resililence are urgently needed, that are adaptive over time, connect terrestrial and marine systems and link different sectors. Engaging communities is a fundamental part of successful climate change action and the intentional inclusion of social and cultural groups will benefit efforts to build climate resilence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:rmR93V40Y70C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5026800384209874055", "cites_id": ["5026800384209874055"], "pub_url": "http://repository.usp.ac.fj/10794/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h2yg-VDIwkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
