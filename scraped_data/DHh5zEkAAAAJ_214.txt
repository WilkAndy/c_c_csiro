By modifying the future atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the carbon-climate feedbacks will also influence the future trajectory for ocean acidification. Here, we use the CO2 emissions scenarios from 4 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with an Earth System Model to project the future trajectories of ocean 5 acidification with the inclusion of carbon-climate feedbacks. We show that simulated carbon-climate feedbacks can significantly impact the onset of under-saturated aragonite conditions in the Southern and Arctic Oceans, the suitable habitat for tropical coral and the deepwater saturation states. Under higher emission scenarios (RCP8. 5 and RCP6. 0), the carbon-climate feedbacks advance the onset of under-saturation conditions and the reduction in suitable coral reef habitat by a decade or more. 10 The impact of the carbon-climate feedback is most significant for the medium (RCP4. 5) and low emission (RCP2. 6) scenarios. For RCP4. 5 scenario by 2100, the carbon-climate feedbacks nearly double the area of surface water under-saturated respect to aragonite and reduce by 50% the surface water suitable for coral reefs. For RCP2. 6 scenario by 2100, the carbon-climate feedbacks reduce the area suitable for coral reefs by 40% and increase the area of under-saturated surface water by 15 20%. The high sensitivity of the impact of ocean acidification to the carbon-climate feedbacks in the low to medium emissions scenarios is important because our recent commitments to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:cwugQcE3IssC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14371839237016146040", "cites_id": ["14371839237016146040"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14371839237016146040&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eFBeC6QHc8cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
