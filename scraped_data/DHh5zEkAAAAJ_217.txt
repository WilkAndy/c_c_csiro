We show that the AOU systematically overestimates the True Oxygen Utilization (TOU) in 6 coupled circulationbiogeochemical ocean models, due to atmosphere\u2013ocean oxygen disequilibrium in the 5 subduction regions, consistent with prior work. We develop a new approach that we call Evaluated Oxygen Utilization (EOU), which approximates the TOU at least twice as well as AOU in all 6 models, despite large differences in the physical and biological components of the models. Applying the EOU approach to a global observational dataset leads to an estimated biological oxygen consumption rate that is by 25 percent 10 lower than that derived from AOU-based estimates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Dyy3vkn44wwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12361830579332168266", "cites_id": ["12361830579332168266"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas-Oschlies/publication/258758067_A_new_estimate_of_ocean_oxygen_utilization_points_to_a_reduced_rate_of_respiration_in_the_ocean_interior/links/545aa4840cf2c16efbbbc2fc/A-new-estimate-of-ocean-oxygen-utilization-points-to-a-reduced-rate-of-respiration-in-the-ocean-interior.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SrqnhmoLjqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
