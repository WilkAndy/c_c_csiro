During the late 1970\u2019sa climate regime transition preceded a period of strong and sustained El Nino events. Using an ocean general circulation model forced by the constituent mechanical and thermodynamics components of the reanalysed atmosphere we show that the late 1970\u2019s transition coincided with the arrival of a large-scale, sub-surface cold and fresh water anomaly in the central tropical Pacific. An ocean reanalysis for the period 1990-2007 that assimilates subsurface Argo, XBT and CTD data, reveals that disturbances occur due to the subduction of negative surface salinity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:rv71eUSj1K8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14377936698402461309", "cites_id": ["14377936698402461309"], "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2014/EGU2014-1138.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fdZU5z-xiMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
