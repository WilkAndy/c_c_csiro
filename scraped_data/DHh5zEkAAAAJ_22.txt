Time-series observations at 200 and 1000m, and short-term measurements using surface-tethered free-drifting sediment traps also were made intermittently. We present data for fluxes of total mass (dry weight), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), biogenic Si (BSi), and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) in calcium carbonate. Mean monthly fluxes at 3800m showed distinct seasonality with an annual minimum during winter months (December\u2013March), and maximum during summer and fall (April\u2013November). Fluxes of total mass, POC, PIC and BSi showed 4-, 10-, 7- and 5-fold increases between extreme months, respectively.
