Central estimates from both models and data-based methods generally fall within the+/-40% error bars first established by the IPCC in 1990. Greater uncertainty is associated with regional uptake patterns and future uptake. To help evaluate model uncertainties, and to set the stage for improving predictability, we have compared simulations of anthropogenic CO 2 in 12 climatologically forced, coarseresolution ocean models as part of the second phase of the Ocean Carbon-Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (OCMIP), an IGBP/GAIM-JGOFS initiative. Simulated global uptake for the 1980's was 2.0+/-0.4 Pg C/yr (+/-20% about the mean). Agreement between models worsened with time in two different future scenarios: in the first (IPCC scenario S650), atmospheric CO 2 was stabilized at 650 ppm, and in the second (IPCC scenario \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12008987876570360647", "cites_id": ["12008987876570360647"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12008987876570360647&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R-vy7th-qKYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
