Seven models have been used to study the efficiency of the sequestration of CO2 injected artificially into the deep ocean. All models are coarse-resolution. All but the PIUB model are 3-D, the latter being zonally averaged in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian. The circulation field of the AWI model is derived, with an adjoint method, from hydrographic, nutrients and carbon observations. The other models explicitely solve the full or simplified primitive equations. Models differ in their forcing fields (heat and fresh water fluxes, wind stress,...), lateral and vertical mixing, and numerics. Simulation protocols were designed as part of the international project GOSAC (Global Ocean Storage of Anthropogenic Carbon) in conjunction with OCMIP (Ocean Carbon-Cycle Intercomparison Project). For computational efficiency, no marine biota is accounted for. In a first set of experiments (C), models are integrated from a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10662020744440165220", "cites_id": ["10662020744440165220"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10662020744440165220&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZLMzlGAb95MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
