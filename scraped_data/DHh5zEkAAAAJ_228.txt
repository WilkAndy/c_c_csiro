This outgassing varies depending on the El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and decadal climate variability. New production, the amount of phytoplankton net primary production driven by upwelled nitrate, plays a significant role in modulating air\u2010sea CO2 fluxes as the biological carbon pump removes carbon from the surface ocean. We aim to understand how the physical drivers of sea surface temperature and wind speed influence interannual and decadal variability of the equatorial Pacific carbon cycle. In the equatorial Pacific, there are three biogeochemical regimes: the upwelling cold tongue east of 140\u00b0W and south of the equator (3\u00b0N\u201315\u00b0S); the eastern Pacific warm pool north of the equator (3\u00b0\u201315\u00b0N); and the 28.5\u00b0C western Pacific warm pool, west of 140\u00b0W. We find that between 2000 and 2020, air\u2010sea CO2 flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:VoB_afVdn6EC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13789472793805750897", "cites_id": ["13789472793805750897"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GB007121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cYK0OnIMXr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
