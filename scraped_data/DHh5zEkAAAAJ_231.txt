Observational studies show that OA will impact ocean biogeochemical cycles. Here, we use a coupled carbon-climate Earth System Model under the RCP8. 5 emission scenario to evaluate and quantify the first-order 5 impacts of OA on marine biogeochemical cycles and the potential feedback on our future climate over this century. We find that OA impacts have only a small impact on the future atmospheric CO2 (less than 45ppm) and future global warming (less than a 0.25 K) by 2100. While the climate change feedbacks are small, OA impacts may significantly alter the distribution of biological production and remineralization, which 10 would alter the dissolved oxygen distribution in the ocean interior. Our results demonstrate that the consequences of OA will not be through its impact on climate change, but on how it impacts the flow of energy in marine ecosystems, which may significantly impact their productivity, composition and diversity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4200218843401137041", "cites_id": ["4200218843401137041"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/10/17683/2013/bgd-10-17683-2013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kavTy8gsSjoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
