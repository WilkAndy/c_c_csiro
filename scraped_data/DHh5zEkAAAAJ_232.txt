The use of tide-induced vertical viscosity and diffusivity in addition to other large-scale drivers of ocean mixing processes such as wind and current shear leads to moderate improvements and more realistic upper-ocean temperature structures on larger scales. However, parameterized tide-induced mixing in the eddy-admitting model causes too strong mixing in shelf sea areas such as the British Channel/Irish Sea and the East China/Yellow Seas. The overall result from both models is that care must be taken when tidal mixing parameterizations are applied to ocean circulation models. Each individual use of a tidal mixing parameterization requires careful fine-tuning; and its impact on model skill should be considered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1831538460748335744", "cites_id": ["1831538460748335744"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500313001133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gMpesYbuahkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
