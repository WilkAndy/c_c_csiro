Net oceanic uptake of CO2 has roughly doubled between the 1960\u2019s (\u223c 1 Pg C yr\u2212 1) and 2000\u2019s (\u223c 2 Pg C yr\u2212 1), with expectations it will continue to absorb 5 even more CO2 with rising future atmospheric CO2 levels. However, recent CO2 observational analyses along with numerous model predictions suggest the rate of oceanic CO2 uptake is already slowing, largely as a result of a natural decadal-scale outgassing signal. This recent and unexpected CO2 outgassing signal represents a paradigm-shift in our understanding of the oceans role in modulating atmospheric CO2. Current tracer-10 based estimates for the ocean storage of anthropogenic CO2 assume the ocean circulation and biology is in steady state, thereby missing the new and potentially important \u201cnon-steady-state\u201d CO2 outgassing signal. By combining data-based techniques that assume the ocean is in steady-state, with techniques that constrain the net oceanic CO2 uptake signal, we show how to extract the non-steady-state CO2 signal from ob-15 servations. Over the entire industrial era, the non-steady-state CO2 outgassing signal (\u223c 13\u00b110PgC) is estimated to represent about 9% of the total net CO2 inventory change (\u223c 142PgC). However between 1989 and 2007, the non-steady-state CO2 outgassing signal (\u223c 6.3 PgC) has likely increased to be\u223c 18% of net oceanic CO2 storage over that period (\u223c 36 PgC), a level which cannot be ignored.
