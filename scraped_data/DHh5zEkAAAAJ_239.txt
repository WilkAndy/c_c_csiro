The tracer transports calculated from the INDOPAC section were better able to close the tracer budgets in the North Pacific than the Levitus section. The transport calculations showed that highly resolved hydrographic data are necessary to accurately determine the tracer transports, and pointed out the sensitivity of the calculation to errors in the Ekman transports and air-sea exchanges of fresh water. The inverse box model was applied to data generated from the Hamburg LSGOC-biogeochemical model. For this data, the mixing transports of the tracers were important for closing the tracer budgets. Applying the inverse box model to the temperature, salinity, total CO2, alkalinity, phosphate, oxygen, POC, calcite, and 14C fields produced poor results. With the addition of velocity shear information, the inverse box model extracted the correct velocity fields and produced air-sea exchanges and detrital rain rates consistent with the known values from the Hamburg model. A model of the nutrient and carbon cycles in the North Pacific north of 24 N is formulated, and water flow rates, eddy mixing coefficients, particle fluxes and air-sea exchange rates of fresh water, heat, CO2 and 02 are calculated. The model incorporates geostrophy, wind-driven Ekman transports and budget equations for a suite of seven tracers. Geostrophic transports are based on two highly resolved synoptic sections across the North Pacific at 24 N (Roemmich et al., 1991) and 47 N (Talley et al., 1991).
