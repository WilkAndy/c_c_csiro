Different approaches have been used to estimate sea\u2013air CO2 fluxes in this region: synthesis of surface ocean observations, ocean biogeochemical models, and atmospheric and ocean inversions. As part of the RECCAP (REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes) project, we combine these different approaches to quantify and assess the magnitude and variability in Southern Ocean sea\u2013air CO2 fluxes between 1990\u20132009. Using all models and inversions (26), the integrated median annual sea\u2013air CO2 flux of \u22120.42 \u00b1 0.07 Pg C yr\u22121 for the 44\u201375\u00b0 S region, is consistent with the \u22120.27 \u00b1 0.13 Pg C yr\u22121 calculated using surface observations. The circumpolar region south of 58\u00b0 S has a small net annual flux (model and inversion median: \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.07 Pg C yr\u22121 and observations: +0.04 \u00b1 0.02 Pg C yr\u22121), with most of the net annual flux located in the 44 to 58\u00b0 S circumpolar band (model and inversion median: \u22120.36 \u00b1 0.09 Pg C yr\u22121 and observations: \u22120.35 \u00b1 0.09 Pg C yr\u22121). Seasonally, in the 44\u201358\u00b0 S region, the median of 5 ocean biogeochemical models captures the observed sea\u2013air CO2 flux seasonal cycle, while the median of 11 atmospheric inversions shows little seasonal change in the net flux. South of 58\u00b0 S, neither atmospheric inversions nor ocean biogeochemical models reproduce the phase and amplitude of the observed seasonal sea\u2013air CO2 flux, particularly in the Austral Winter. Importantly, no individual atmospheric inversion or ocean biogeochemical model is capable of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 202, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3818250929391722250", "cites_id": ["3818250929391722250"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/4037/2013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ct-yhf0m_TQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 21, "2015": 31, "2016": 29, "2017": 26, "2018": 21, "2019": 19, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 21, "2023": 6}}
