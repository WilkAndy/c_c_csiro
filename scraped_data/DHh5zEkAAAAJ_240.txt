The hottest days in the   Pacific Northwest in the large ensemble have similar large scale and   synoptic patterns to those associated with the observed event.  From   the perspective of a fixed location, the hottest ensemble days are   acutely sensitive to the chance sequencing of a dry period with a   precisely positioned weather pattern.  These days are thus rare and   require very large samples (tens of thousands of years) to capture.   The enduring nature of record-shattering heat records can be   understood through this lens of weather `noise' and sampling.  When   a record-shattering event occurs due to chance alignment of weather   systems in the optimal configuration, any small sample of years   subsequent to the (very unlikely) record \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Qwfv3SoyJx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/acd714/meta", "cites_per_year": {}}
