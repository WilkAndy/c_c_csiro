These extremes significantly impact Australian society, ecosystems, and the economy. Developing robust future Australian climate projections would allow the development of actionable adaptation and mitigation strategies and thereby help build a climate-resilient society. Dynamical and statistical downscaling approaches are used to produce high-resolution regional scale climate data that represent the local to regional scale atmospheric processes and more skilfully simulate some extreme events (eg, extreme rainfall and winds). Dynamical downscaling using Regional Climate Models (RCMs) can provide high-resolution future climate information with physical realism, however it is computationally expensive. Statistical downscaling using machine learning algorithms has been gaining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:QvnCfHfiBIkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFM.A55C..05P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
