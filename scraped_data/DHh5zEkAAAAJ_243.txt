The environmental and ecological impacts of the fires include loss of habitats and the emission of substantial amounts of atmospheric aerosols. Aerosol emissions from wildfires can lead to the atmospheric transport of macronutrients and bio-essential trace metals such as nitrogen and iron, respectively. Previous works suggested that the oceanic deposition of wildfire aerosols can relieve nutrient limitations and, consequently, enhance marine productivity, but direct observations are lacking. Here we use satellite and autonomous biogeochemical Argo float data to evaluate the effect of 2019\u20132020 Australian wildfire aerosol deposition on phytoplankton productivity. We find widespread and long-lasting phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean downwind of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:4givWmz5LegC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-9414.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
