Several studies have attempted to link individual dust events with surface chlorophyll responses but generally, they do not find a clear correspondence between dust deposition and its impact on chlorophyll. In this work, we use a biogeochemical model to show that the atmospheric deposition of Fe in high-latitude seas, rather than creating instantaneous phytoplankton responses, replenish the upper mixed layer of the ocean during the pre-bloom period, from winter to early summer. The Fe accumulated at the surface boosts the phytoplankton bloom of the following summer, resulting in surface chlorophyll accumulations of up to 3 times larger than the years without atmospheric deposition. We used this mechanism to explain the strong \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:9tJtKg94vZsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..22.7809L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
