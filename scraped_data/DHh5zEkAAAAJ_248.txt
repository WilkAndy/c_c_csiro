Specifically, it summarises the current state of climate processes research in Australia, identifies gaps, and provides options for moving the area forward into the next decade.The report is founded on two major initiatives. First, it presents the results of a large community survey on climate research in general and climate processes research specifically. In doing so, it refines the results of the recent Climate Science Capability Review conducted by the Australian Academy of Science. Second, the report details the outcomes of a workshop of current and emerging climate science leaders that discussed future priorities and options for future research coordination."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:mN77zE6YZBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://climateextremes.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Climate-Process-Report-Final-R2.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
