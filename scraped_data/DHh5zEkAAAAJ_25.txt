We use the distributions and inventories of these tracers as quantitative metrics of model skill and find that only about a quarter of the suite is consistent with the new data\u2010based metrics. This should serve as a warning bell to the larger community that not all is well with current generation of ocean carbon cycle models. At the same time, this highlights the danger in simply using the available models to represent the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art modeling without considering the credibility of each model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 202, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13124692008392135150,16582496571234590189", "cites_id": ["13124692008392135150", "16582496571234590189"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003GL018970", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7hGfEthFJLYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 18, "2006": 19, "2007": 22, "2008": 11, "2009": 15, "2010": 16, "2011": 14, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 13, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
