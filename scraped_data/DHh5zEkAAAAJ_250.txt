Century-long simulations of the CAF\u00c9 atmosphere-ocean model demonstrate considerable realism in the model ENSO and its teleconnection to rainfall in much of the Asia-Pacific region, and beyond. Atmospheric horizontal moisture transport is modulated, and the convergence of the moisture fluxes is a key component of the moisture budget. Over Australia, particularly in summer, interannual variability of convergence is highly correlated with that in rainfall. Increasingly, moisture transport is being analysed in the assessment of seasonal forecasts. New multi-year hindcast ensembles from CAF\u00c9 provide an opportunity to extend this to the Australian region. These ensembles are initialised \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:8U9l5EwV_MEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140494162&h=LdApET1HAGj8gllqoaaf9O59gUoY4RDRhXxaxSjTqSM1ExApSjueV46Oe%2BVGhARyE18nc9yoWJo00O%2BZDj6oCg%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
