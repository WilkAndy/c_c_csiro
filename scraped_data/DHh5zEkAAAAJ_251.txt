A leading theory to explain biological CO 2 drawdown is iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean (Martin, 1990; Martinez-Garcia, 2014). However, estimates of CO 2 drawdown via this mechanism are 15 ppm at most (Kohfeld & Ridgwell, 2009; Tagliabue et al., 2014; Muglia et al., 2017), leaving 15 ppm unexplained. By integrating dinitrogen (N 2) fixing microbes within an ocean model equipped with variable stoichiometry, we show that an iron-induced stimulation of N 2 fixation can permanently sequester 7-17 ppm of CO 2. Two thirds of the drawdown is due to supply of fixed nitrogen, specifically to tropical communities above oxygen-poor zones. The remaining third is due to export of carbon enriched organic matter as a result of N 2 fixers becoming a greater proportion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:KEHW5XCvxlQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMOS32D..05B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
