Each of these CO2 increase is associated with a decrease in its isotopic composition (\u03b413CO2). The underlying mechanisms driving the CO2 increase and \u03b413CO2 decrease remain a subject of intense debate. By performing transient simulations of HS1 with a 3-dimensional carbon isotope enabled model, we show that the HS1 atmospheric CO2 rise and \u03b413CO2 decrease can be explained by enhanced ventilation of Antarctic bottom and intermediate waters resulting from intensified southern hemisphere (SH) westerlies and reduced buoyancy forcing. We further show that this enhanced Southern Ocean ventilation results in atmospheric and oceanic carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:LYW2S8xaXYEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..20.4119M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
