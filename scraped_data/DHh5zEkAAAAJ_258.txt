Background colours represent bathymetry between 0 and 4,000 m. LEFT: Map of the Southern Ocean showing geographical positions of subduction events. Blue circles represent the the POC in the subducted water parcels. ABOVE: Spatial density map of bgcArgo profiles per 1/2 degree as of January 2018. ALL: Pink, red and black solid lines represent the climatological position of the STF, SAF and PF.LEFT: Vertical profiles of (left) spiciness and density,(middle) AOU and O2 and;(right) Chl-a and POC. Solid blue lines represent the measured signal and dashed blue lines represent the 150m-smoothed signal. ABOVE: Diagram representing the subduction of carbon-rich surface water along an isopycnal layer. Yellow rectangle represents a float (see right image for details) which crosses the subducted water parcel. Diagram adapted from Omand et al, 2015 and bgcArgo illustration by Kelly Lance\u00a9 MBARI"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:cKQgJgBA5EIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joan-Llort/publication/323229075_Occurrence_of_subduction_events_across_the_Southern_Ocean_and_its_contribution_to_the_biological_carbon_pump/links/5a87694f458515b8af8d61fd/Occurrence-of-subduction-events-across-the-Southern-Ocean-and-its-contribution-to-the-biological-carbon-pump.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
