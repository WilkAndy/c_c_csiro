Carbon-Climate feedbacks are one of the key uncertainties in future climate projections (the authors comment on this fact a few times across the manuscript). How does the strength of the carbon-climate feedbacks in this particular model compare with that of the other CMIP5 models? EP vs CP is a standard protocol, so data is available. To which part of the model spread do you belong toResponse: We added a more through comparison of both the CP and EP driven climate projections to the discussion (new section included).
