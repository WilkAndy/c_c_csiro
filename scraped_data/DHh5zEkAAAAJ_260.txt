Subduction and formation of mode water transports nutrients and carbon from this High Nitrate Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) region to upwelling regions where they are reventilated supporting primary productivity. While it has been long recognized that this process sustains a significant part of the low-latitude primary productivity, it is less clear what these pathways mean for the global carbon cycle. How much of the carbon that leaves the SO is reventilated through these processes remains an open question. The fate of this carbon and the timescales associated with its reventilation, are critical to understanding current and future global carbon budgets.Here we quantify the efficiency of the SO carbon uptake, and the relative importance of the physical and biological carbon pumps now and into the future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:8d0RQTsQA7wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/4ICESM/4ICESM-82.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
