However, the combination of processes that cause an accumulation of carbon within the ocean during glacial periods is still under debate. Here we present simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using the CSIRO Mk3L-COAL Earth System Model to test the contribution of key biogeochemical processes to ocean carbon storage. For the coupled LGM simulation, we find that significant cooling (3.2 C), expanded minimum (Northern Hemisphere: 105%; Southern Hemisphere: 225%) and maximum (Northern Hemisphere: 145%; Southern Hemisphere: 120%) sea ice cover, and a reorganisation of the overturning circulation caused significant changes in ocean biogeochemical fields.
