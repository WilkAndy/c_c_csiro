Understanding its dynamics is of fundamental importance, given its major role in the carbon cycle and, hence, in the global climate system. The first sub-mesoscale-resolving (1/80) model of the Kerguelen Plateau Region, located in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, has been implemented. The model resolves sub-mesoscale filamentary structures and shows patchiness in the sub-mesoscale eddy kinetic energy and vertical velocities. The vertical velocities, which are dramatically higher than in mesoscale-resolving models, strongly enhance the vertical exchange of advected Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, we find evidence that the patchiness in the sub-mesoscale fields is related to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMOS31C1014R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
