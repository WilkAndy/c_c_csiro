Key biogeochemical parameters are determined by minimizing a suitably weighted quadratic misfit between the model's dissolved iron concentration and a global data set of sparse measurements. The global dissolved iron inventory is estimated to be (7.1\u00b10.1)\u00d7 1011 mol Fe, of which (6.9\u00b10.1)\u00d7 1011 mol Fe is bound to organic ligands and hence bioavailable, while the remainder is\" free\" iron. The aeolian iron input rate is estimated at (3.3\u00b10.5)\u00d7 109 mol Fe/year, corresponding to a bulk residence time for bioavailable iron of 215\u00b140 years, comparable to the bulk biological cycling timescale estimated at 246\u00b124 years. Iron limitation is quantified in terms of the difference [Fe\u2217] between the actual iron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMOS51B0981F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
