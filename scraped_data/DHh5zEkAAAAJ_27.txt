For these studies, we have put the results on a common basis and conducted a sensitivity analysis. Three types of power plants were reviewed: pulverized coal plants, integrated gasification combined cycle plants, and natural gas combined cycle plants. Based on our analysis, we summarize the costs of CO2 capture using today\u2019s technology. In addition, we have identified where technological improvements can significantly lower costs. We conclude that with new developments, CO2 capture and sequestration can become a cost-effective mitigation pathway."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:6UW509z96lEC", "num_citations": 186, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17471601176183391878,4660405729908499285", "cites_id": ["17471601176183391878", "4660405729908499285"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=c3b93b755e2b11825773ea9b02f11555de132c8c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hka1g7OYd_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 8, "2001": 12, "2002": 11, "2003": 16, "2004": 10, "2005": 16, "2006": 11, "2007": 7, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 12, "2014": 12, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
