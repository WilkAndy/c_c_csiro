Examining 20C3M simulations (which most closely resemble the observed 20th century climate system), explicitly dealing with model drift, and using a technique to extract the broad-scale, zonal change patterns, a strong relationship is found between changes in the global surface water flux (evaporation minus precipitation; EP) over the oceans (where 75-90% of global surface water exchange occurs) and changes to surface salinity. New observed surface salinity estimates suggest a surface salinity spatial pattern intensification of 16\u00b17% K-1 has occurred since 1950, a marker of change to the oceanic water cycle.
