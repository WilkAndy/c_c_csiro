This requires sub-models to simulate carbon exchange between the land and atmosphere and between the ocean and atmosphere. Land uptake of carbon by photosynthesis is simulated by the Community Atmosphere Land Biosphere Exchange (CABLE) model. CABLE also includes simplified plant and soil respiration functions but a more comprehensive treatment of these fluxes and their associated carbon pools is provided by CASA-CNP. CASA-CNP can also be used to simulate nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) limitation on carbon fluxes. The ocean carbon cycle is modelled using WOMBAT (world ocean model with biogeochemistry and trophic-dynamics). WOMBAT includes a two-component plankton model (phytoplankton and zooplankton) where the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:vG0dlTq9_mQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP116429&sb=RECENT&n=5&rpp=10&page=61&tr=5057&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "cites_per_year": {}}
