Here, biological dependencies on the Rain and Redfield ratios on pCO2 are implemented in a coupled Biogeochemistry-Ocean Model, the CSIRO-Mk3L, to establish extreme-case carbon-5 ate saturation vulnerability to model parameterisation at year 2500 using IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Surface carbonate saturation is relatively insensitive to the combined effects of variable Rain and Redfield ratios (an anomaly of less than 10% of the corresponding change in the control configuration by year 2500), but the global zonally-averaged ocean interior anomaly due to these feedbacks is up 10 to 130% by 2500. A non-linear interaction between organic and carbonate pumps is found in export production, where higher rates of photosynthesis enhance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:TWu9ukPC6OgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10497850539786265415&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R2MaKXLbr5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
