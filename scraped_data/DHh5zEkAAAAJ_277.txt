Abstract SeaWiFS surface chlorophyll estimates in the sub-Antarctic zone show low concentrations south west of Tasmania and high concentrations south east of Tasmania. Data assimilation experiments were performed using simulated annealing to obtain parameter estimates of a simple mixed-layer marine ecosystem model at two locations in this region(station P 1 at 46 S, 140 E and station P 3 at 45 S, 153 E) utilizing SeaWiFS chlorophyll observations. Model parameter estimates are compared to in situ parameter estimates from the SAZ-Sense(Sub-Antarctic Zone Sensitivity to environmental change) project stations P 1 and P 3 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8147113231268932927&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
