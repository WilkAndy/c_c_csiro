Unfortunately, we lack critical understanding to adequately address the first two mechanisms. For the third mechanism, we know that rising CO2 levels in the ocean will reduce the ability of biological organisms to calcify with the possibility in the near future that the surface seawater will become corrosive to calcium carbonate formed by marine biota. But, it is not clear what the wider ecosystem consequences of these changes will be."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://wamsi.org.au/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/2021/01/A-Changing-Climate-abstract-papers.pdf#page=24", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gr3qSUohN8AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
