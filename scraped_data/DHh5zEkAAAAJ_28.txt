Our simulations show the Southern Ocean to be a region of decreased CO2 uptake during the positive SAM phase. The SAM induces changes in Southern Ocean CO2 uptake with a 2\u2010month time lag explaining 42% of the variance in the total interannual variability in air\u2010sea CO2 fluxes. Our analysis shows that the response of the Southern Ocean to the SAM is primarily governed by changes in \u0394pCO2 (67%), and that this response is driven by changes in ocean physics that control the supply of nutrients to the upper ocean, primarily Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 178, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12469032546590586495", "cites_id": ["12469032546590586495"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006GB002714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f_ZQkAnnCq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 14, "2010": 9, "2011": 5, "2012": 13, "2013": 18, "2014": 12, "2015": 16, "2016": 10, "2017": 14, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
