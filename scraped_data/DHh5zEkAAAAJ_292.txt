The technical configuration and details of the sub-models are presented here. Initial results, including the development of a displaced pole bipolar cean grid, are also discussed. A outlook for future model development and of further community model systems are reported on."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/104744/", "cites_per_year": {}}
