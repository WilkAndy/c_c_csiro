However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in both magnitude and regional patterns of anthropogenic uptake associated with estimates of oceanic carbon fluxes. Using a recently developed technique, exchange of anthropogenic carbon dioxide across the air-sea interface have been estimated from observations of dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrient concentrations and an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) using a Green's function inverse modeling technique. Previous sensitivity studies have shown that model circulation error is an important source of error in the ocean inversion. In order to address the role of ocean circulation biases, inverse estimates of anthropogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.A31F..02M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
