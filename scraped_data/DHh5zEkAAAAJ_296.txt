Using only models that fit the observed deep natural radiocarbon distribution and basin-scale CFC-11 inventories, we estimate the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon for the 1980s and 1990s to be 1.9\u00b10.2 and 2.2\u00b10.2 Pg-C (Pg= 10 15 g) respectively. These new model estimates are comparable to previous estimates but have smaller uncertainty. Our study also indicates that models that match CFC-11 overpredict anthropogenic carbon. If we assume that the data-model comparison for directly measurable CFC-11 is more significant than for data-derived anthropogenic carbon, then the reliability of the latter may be questioned. However, the cause of the \u201cdata\u201d-model discrepancy for anthropogenic carbon is not obvious as we discuss.Three \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2924270096984367919&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L-MM5igYlSgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
