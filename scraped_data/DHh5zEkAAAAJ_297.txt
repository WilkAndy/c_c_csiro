For the 1980s, models agreed to within+/-22%(1.99+/-0.43 Pg C yr-1, half the range over the mean). For the 1990s the OCMIP-2 models predict a 24% uptake increase (2.38+/-0.53 Pg C yr-1), in contrast with the 1980s-to-1990s decrease predicted by the most recent IPCC Third Assessment Report Chapter 3. However, the IPCC's estimates are based on atmospheric O2 measurements which are susceptible to error due to interannual variations in air-sea O2 fluxes. It appears likely that the OCMIP-2 range for the modern uptake of anthropogenic CO2 brackets real ocean uptake for four reasons:(1) the large model diversity;(2) the range of OCMIP-2 models bracket observed tracer constraints (CFC-11 along sections, global mean deep-ocean 14C);(3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AGUFMOS52B0222A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
