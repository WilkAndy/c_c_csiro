The ultimate goal is to minimize any impacts associated with the eventual use of ocean carbon sequestration to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The project will continue through March 31, 2002, with a field experiment to take place in the summer of 2001 off the Kona Coast of Hawaii. At GHGT-4 in Interlaken, a paper was presented detailing the plans. The purpose of this paper is to present an update on the progress to date and the plans to complete the project. The co-authors of the paper are members of the project's Technical Committee, which has been formed to supervise the technical aspects and execution of this project. An alternative to injecting CO{sub 2} from shore through a pipe will now be field tested, which is to inject CO{sub 2} from a supply ship to a depth of 800 m. The planned injection process is described and project objectives outlines. Data will be obtained on changes in sea water chemistry by the release of CO{sub 2}. A sampling of biota and a study of the effects of the discharged CO{sub 2} or naturally occuring bacteria populations are planned. The project officers are liaising with the public about the environmental aims and concerns of this project, one of the first to bring the concept of CO{sub 2} ocean sequestration into full public view.
