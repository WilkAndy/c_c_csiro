This is known from numerous, well-replicated measurements of the composition of air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have been measured directly with high precision since 1957; these measurements agree with ice-core measurements, and show a continuation of the increasing trend up to the present. Several additional lines of evidence confirm that the recent and continuing increase of atmospheric CO2 content is caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions\u2013most importantly fossil fuel burning. First, atmospheric O2 is declining at a rate comparable with fossil fuel emissions of CO2 (combustion consumes O2). Second, the characteristic isotopic signatures of fossil fuel (its lack of 14C, and depleted content of 13C) leave their mark in the atmosphere. Third, the increase in observed CO2 concentration has been faster in the northern hemisphere, where most fossil fuel burning occurs.Atmospheric CO2 is, however, increasing only at about half the rate of fossil fuel emissions; the rest of the CO2 emitted either dissolves in sea water and mixes into the deep ocean, or is taken up by terrestrial ecosystems. Uptake by terrestrial ecosystems is due to an excess of primary production (photosynthesis) over respiration and other oxidative processes (decomposition or combustion of organic material). Terrestrial systems are also an"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:0PPYGq5nos8C", "num_citations": 2092, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11688323116268840718,11395686880157330333", "cites_id": ["11688323116268840718", "11395686880157330333"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-03333974/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DucwZfJDNaIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 45, "2003": 81, "2004": 117, "2005": 144, "2006": 157, "2007": 134, "2008": 130, "2009": 110, "2010": 98, "2011": 93, "2012": 87, "2013": 114, "2014": 100, "2015": 94, "2016": 88, "2017": 71, "2018": 70, "2019": 63, "2020": 74, "2021": 62, "2022": 79, "2023": 36}}
