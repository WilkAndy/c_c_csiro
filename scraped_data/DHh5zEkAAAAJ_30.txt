Water on the continental shelf had potential density (\u03c3\u03b8) as great as 27.0, with high CFC concentrations and low temperature and salinity. The Sea of Okhotsk Intermediate Water (SOIW) ranging from 26.8 to 27.4 \u03c3\u03b8 had uniform water properties along isopycnal surfaces that were distinctly different from either the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) or the shelf water found at the same density. Since the SOIW was colder and fresher than the NPIW, we postulate that SOIW is formed by sinking plumes and diapycnal mixing.
