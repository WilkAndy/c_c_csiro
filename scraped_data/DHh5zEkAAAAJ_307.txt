The transport calculations showed that highly resolved hydrographic data are necessary for accurate determination of the tracer transports. The calculations also pointed out their sensitivity to errors in the Ekman transports and air-sea exchanges of fresh water. The inverse box model was applied to data generated from a biogeochemical model. For these data, the mixing transports were important for closing the tracer budgets. Applying the inverse box model to the temperature, salinity, total CO[sub 2], alkalinity, phosphate, oxygen, particulate organic carbon, calcite, and [sup 14]C fields produced poor results. By adding velocity shear information, the model extracted the correct velocity fields and produced air-sea exchanges and detrital rain rates consistent with known values. A model of the nutrient and carbon cycles in the North Pacific is formulated, and water flow rates, eddy mixing coefficients, particle fluxes, and air-sea exchange rates of fresh water, heat, CO[sub 2], and O[sub 2] are calculated. The model incorporates geostrophy, wind-driven Ekman transports, and budget equations for a suite of seven tracers. Budgets of heat, mass, salt, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, CO[sub 2], and alkalinity are satisfied simultaneously. The calculated heat transport showed that the subtropical North Pacific transfers heat into the atmosphere while the subarctic ocean gains heat. The North Pacific was calculated to be a sink of ca 0.1 gigatonnes/y of atmospheric carbon. The model showed that the dissolved organic matter had little \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:dL6bBWYs_hoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/7239662", "cites_per_year": {}}
