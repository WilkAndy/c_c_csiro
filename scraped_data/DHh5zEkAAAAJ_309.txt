Aerosol emissions from wildfires can lead to the atmospheric transport of macronutrients and trace metals such as nitrogen and iron (Fe), respectively (Guieu et al., 2005, Schlosser et al., 2017). It has been suggested that the oceanic deposition of wildfire aerosols can relieve nutrient limitations and, consequently, enhance marine productivity (Ito et al., 2011, Hamilton et al., 2022), but direct observations are lacking. Here we use satellite and atmospheric reanalysis data to evaluate the effect of 2019\u20132020 Australian wildfire aerosol deposition on phytoplankton productivity. We find anomalously widespread phytoplankton blooms from December 2019 to March 2020 in the Southern Ocean downwind of Australia. Aerosol samples originating from the Australian wildfires contained a high Fe content and atmospheric trajectories show that these aerosols were likely to be transported to the bloom regions, suggesting that the blooms resulted from the fertilization of the iron-limited waters of the Southern Ocean.
