Previous studies have focus on how the land carbon uptake may impact the future climate 4 but by modifying the atmospheric CO2 concentrations the land uptake will also influence the future trajectory for ocean acidification. Ocean acidification (OA) has the potential to significantly impact marine ecosystem by reducing calcifications rates 5, altering phytoplankton composition6, changing fish behaviour7 and affecting larval recruitment8.MethodsMaking accurate projection of ocean acidi-fication is essential to assessing the future impact of ocean acidification. Here, we use the CO2 emissions scenarios for 4 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with an Earth Sys-tem Model to project the future trajectory of ocean acidification."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:e6AMIDGT8rIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1873530575330089558&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VhpiwiEeABoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
