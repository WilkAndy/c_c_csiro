However, our understanding of how natural short\u2010term diurnal CO2 variability in coral reefs influences longer term anthropogenic ocean acidification remains unclear. Here, we combine observed natural carbonate chemistry variability with future carbonate chemistry predictions for a coral reef flat in the Great Barrier Reef based on the RCP8.5 CO2 emissions scenario. Rather than observing a linear increase in reef flat partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in concert with rising atmospheric concentrations, the inclusion of in situ diurnal variability results in a highly nonlinear threefold amplification of the pCO2 signal by the end of the century. This significant nonlinear amplification of diurnal pCO2 variability occurs as a result of combining natural diurnal biological CO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13448392348901800511", "cites_id": ["13448392348901800511"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12154", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P3pftJZJoroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 17, "2015": 16, "2016": 17, "2017": 9, "2018": 18, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 16, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
