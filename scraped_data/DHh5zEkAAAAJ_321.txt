The iron model is embedded in a data-assimilated steady-state circulation, with biological cycling driven by a prescribed, data-constrained phosphate cycle. Biogeochemical parameters are determined by minimizing a suitably weighted quadratic mismatch with available dissolved iron (dFe) observations, including GEOTRACES transects. Because the effective iron sources and sinks overlap, current dFe observations cannot constrain sources and sinks independently. We therefore determine a family of optimal solutions for a range of the aeolian source strength \u03c3A from 0.3 to 6.1 Gmol/yr. We find that the dFe observations constrain the maximum Fe: P uptake ratio, R0, to be proportional to \u03c3A, with a range that spans most available measurements. Thus, with either R0 or \u03c3A specified, a unique solution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3617333656531787440&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sF6kj8tZMzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
