In particular we extend the recently introduced FEM-BV-GEV framework for statistical regression analysis of block-maxima based on Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV)[1]. Thereby the presence of systematically missing covariates is reflected by the non-stationarity of the model parameters. The involved non-stationarity and the ill-posedness of the inverse problem are resolved by deploying the Finite Element time series analysis Methodology with Bounded Variation of model parameters (FEM-BV)[2]. The proposed FEM-BV-GPD approach allows a well-posed problem formulation and goes beyond probabilistic a priori assumptions of methods for analysis of extremes based \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=875574425511636145&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sawJD02qJgwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
