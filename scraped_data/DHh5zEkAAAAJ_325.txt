However, the factors controlling future changes in pH and \u2126arag are independent and will respond differently to oceanic climate change feedbacks such as ocean warming, circulation and biological changes. We examine the sensitivity of these CO2-related parameters to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphereocean model. Although surface pH is projected to decrease relatively uniformly by~ 0.25 by the year 2100, we find pH to be insensitive to climate change feedbacks, whereas \u2126arag is buffered by~ 15%. The independent climate change response between pH and \u2126arag is attributed solely to the opposing effects associated with ocean warming, which increases \u2126arag but lowers pH. Our result implies that future climate change projections for surface ocean pH can be adequately simulated using ocean-only models, however for \u2126arag more complex coupled atmosphere-ocean models are required."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://gml.noaa.gov/icdc7/proceedings/abstracts/mcneil2-1HI76.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RF5zhHir1wIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
