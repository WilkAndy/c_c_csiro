The popular eddy-pumping paradigm implies that nutrient fluxes are enhanced in cyclonic eddies because of upwelling inside the eddy, leading to higher phytoplankton production. We show that this view does not hold for a substantial portion of eddies within oceanic subtropical gyres, the largest ecosystems in the ocean. Using space-based measurements and a global biogeochemical model, we demonstrate that during winter when subtropical eddies are most productive, there is increased chlorophyll in anticyclones compared with cyclones in all subtropical gyres (by 3.6 to 16.7% for the five basins). The model suggests that this is a consequence of the modulation of winter mixing by eddies. These results establish a new paradigm for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:V2uI0bKpj5cC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4916254277809597111", "cites_id": ["4916254277809597111"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.1600282", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t-pV3jcLOkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 20, "2020": 23, "2021": 21, "2022": 28, "2023": 9}}
