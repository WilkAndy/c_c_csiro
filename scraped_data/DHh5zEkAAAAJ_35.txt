Much of the variability is associated with mesoscale eddies, and we find that, contrary to canonical ideas, satellite and in situ estimates of surface chlorophyll off WA show low phytoplankton biomass in cyclonic eddies and high biomass in anticyclonic eddies. Off-shelf we found two types of phytoplankton communities; modified shelf communities in anticyclonic eddies and offshore subtropical communities concentrated in the deep chlorophyll maximum outside the anticyclonic eddies. The presence of the modified shelf community offshore in anticyclonic eddies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2138278559793543760", "cites_id": ["2138278559793543760"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064507000732", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UPpTYwWxrB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 13, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 14, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
