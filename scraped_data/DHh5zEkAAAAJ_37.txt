Here we employ an independent method to estimate the Southern Ocean air\u2010sea flux of CO2 that exploits all available surface ocean measurements for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (ALK) beyond 1986. The DIC concentrations were normalized to the year 1995 using coinciding CFC measurements in order to account for the anthropogenic CO2 signal. We show that independent of season, surface\u2010normalized DIC and ALK can be empirically predicted to within \u223c8 \u03bcmol/kg using standard hydrographic properties. The predictive equations were used in conjunction with World Ocean Atlas (2001) climatologies to give a first estimate of the annual cycle of DIC and ALK in the surface Southern Ocean.
