Efforts to detect this long-term response in sparse surface observations of rainfall and evaporation remain ambiguous. We show that ocean salinity patterns express an identifiable fingerprint of an intensifying water cycle. Our 50-year observed global surface salinity changes, combined with changes from global climate models, present robust evidence of an intensified global water cycle at a rate of 8 \u00b1 5% per degree of surface warming. This rate is double the response projected by current-generation climate models and suggests that a substantial (16 to 24%) intensification of the global water cycle will occur in a future 2\u00b0 to 3\u00b0 warmer world."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 924, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=271360870256475085", "cites_id": ["271360870256475085"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1212222", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zfuTFUYRxAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 19, "2013": 73, "2014": 79, "2015": 95, "2016": 93, "2017": 70, "2018": 79, "2019": 97, "2020": 83, "2021": 87, "2022": 96, "2023": 38}}
