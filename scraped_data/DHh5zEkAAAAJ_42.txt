All existing global climate change projections come from simulations that do not fully resolve either these boundary currents or their eddies. Using an Ocean Eddy\u2010resolving Model (OEM) that captures the dynamics of the East Australian Current (EAC) and its eddies we show the response of the Tasman Sea to climate change differs from what is projected with a coarse resolution Global Climate Model (GCM). With climate change, the OEM projects increased EAC transport with increased eddy activity and an approximately 1\u00b0 southward latitudinal shift in the point where the EAC separates from the shelf and flows eastward. The OEM increased eddy activity in the Tasman Sea with climate change increases the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17194948203403690352", "cites_id": ["17194948203403690352"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgrc.20202", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cEEey0m6oO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 7, "2015": 20, "2016": 13, "2017": 13, "2018": 10, "2019": 12, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
