For this period, the deepest penetration of anthropogenic CO2 is consistent with the depth of 28 year old water from CFC\u201011 age estimates. Significant accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 (13\u00b110 \u03bcmol kg\u22121) was found in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) from 500\u20134500 m south of 58\u00b0S suggesting AABW to be an important water mass for the storage of anthropogenic CO2 in the deep ocean. Deep penetration of anthropogenic CO2 (<1900 m) was found in the sub\u2010Antarctic zone (SAZ) between 48\u00b0S and 51\u00b0S while little accumulation (<400 m) was observed south of 53\u00b0S. A simple one dimensional box model was used to investigate the anthropogenic CO2 uptake potential in the SAZ based on observed CFC\u201011 concentrations and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9506201937708355265", "cites_id": ["9506201937708355265"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000jc000331", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wY483EvQ7IMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
