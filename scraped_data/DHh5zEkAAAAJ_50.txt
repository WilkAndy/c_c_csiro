Off Western Australia, this anomalous behavior is related to the seeding of anticyclonic eddies with shelf water enriched in phytoplankton biomass and nutrients. Further off\u2010shore, two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the eddy/chlorophyll relationship: (i) eddies originating from the Australian coast maintain their chlorophyll anomaly while propagating westward; and (ii) eddy\u2010induced Ekman upwelling (downwelling) enhances (dampens) nutrient supply in anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. Here we describe the relationship between eddies and surface chlorophyll within the South Indian Ocean, and discuss possible mechanisms to explain the anomalous behavior in light of new analyses performed using satellite chlorophyll data. We show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15539228987388362248", "cites_id": ["15539228987388362248"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014JC010164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CH68BG9uptcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 9, "2019": 12, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
