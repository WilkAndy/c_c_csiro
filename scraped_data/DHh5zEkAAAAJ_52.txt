However, the factors controlling future changes in pH and \u03a9arag are independent and will respond differently to oceanic climate change feedbacks such as ocean warming, circulation and biological changes.We examine the sensitivity of these two CO2-related parameters to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. The ocean warming feedback was found to dominate the climate change responses in the surface ocean. Although surface pH is projected to decrease relatively uniformly by about 0.3 by the year 2100, we find pH to be insensitive to climate change feedbacks, where as \u03a9arag is buffered by\u02dc15%. Ocean carbonate chemistry creates a situation whereby the direct pH changes due to ocean warming are almost cancelled by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5517048140147876882", "cites_id": ["5517048140147876882"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2006.00241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EmQ-ig1-kEwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 15, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
