Corals build their exoskeleton with aragonite, but ocean acidification is lowering the aragonite saturation state of seawater (\u03a9a). The downscaling of ocean acidification projections from global to GBR scales requires the set of regional drivers controlling \u03a9a to be resolved. Here we use a regional coupled circulation\u2013biogeochemical model and observations to estimate the \u03a9a experienced by the 3,581 reefs of the GBR, and to apportion the contributions of the hydrological cycle, regional hydrodynamics and metabolism on \u03a9a variability. We find more detail, and a greater range (1.43), than previously compiled coarse maps of \u03a9a of the region (0.4), or in observations (1.0). Most of the variability in \u03a9a is due to processes upstream of the reef in question. As a result, future decline in \u03a9a is likely to be steeper on the GBR than currently projected by the IPCC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:vMKmsr18IoIC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14367695778502003790", "cites_id": ["14367695778502003790"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10732", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Tsx97i9PZMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 19, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
