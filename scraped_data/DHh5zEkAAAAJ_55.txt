New instrumental approaches have shown the occurrence of localized and intermittent subduction episodes associated with small\u2010scale ocean circulation features. These studies also revealed the importance of such events for the export of organic matter, the so\u2010called eddy\u2010pump. However, the transient and localized nature of episodic subduction hindered its large\u2010scale evaluation to date. In this work, we present an approach to detect subduction events at the scale of the Southern Ocean using measurements collected by biogeochemical autonomous floats (BGCArgo). We show how subduction events can be automatically identified as anomalies of spiciness and Apparent Oxygen Utilization (AOU) below the mixed layer.
