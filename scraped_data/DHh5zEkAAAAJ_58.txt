This expanse of ocean dwarfs the land in the region and makes up 98% of the total area under the jurisdiction of all Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs)(Chapter 1).Although much of this open ocean domain is relatively unproductive, it supports some of the largest tuna fisheries in the world. The total recent catches of skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna and South Pacific albacore from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is approximately 2.5 million tonnes per year, representing! 25% of the total global tuna catch (Chapters 1, 8 and 12)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7701679293844568612", "cites_id": ["7701679293844568612"], "pub_url": "https://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers13-07/010058145.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JDqWM4Pc4WoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 18, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 7}}
