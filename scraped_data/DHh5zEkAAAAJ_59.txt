The mechanisms of iron supply to the euphotic zone in this region are poorly understood, and numerical studies of iron transport have until now omitted fine-scale (sub-mesoscale) dynamics which have been shown to significantly increase vertical transport in other parts of the ocean.We present the first sub-mesoscale-resolving study of the flow and vertical transport in this region. The modelled transport and flow structure agree well with observations. We find that an increase in horizontal resolution from mesoscale-resolving (1/20\u00b0) to 1/80\u00b0 resolves sub-mesoscale filamentary frontal structures in which vertical velocities are dramatically higher and are consistent with available observations.
