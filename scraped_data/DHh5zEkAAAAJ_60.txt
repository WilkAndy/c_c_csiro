From a mixed-layer model for the spring\u2013summer period, we calculated silicate and nitrate utilization. The silicate utilization (\u0394SiO4) during the growing season displays large interannual variations, suggesting that diatom production would experience similar fluctuations. The years 1972 and 1979 had both high-silicate utilization (\u0394SiO4) and high-nitrate utilization (\u0394NO3). During these two high-production years, the lack of available silicate appeared to limit diatom production. For 1972 and 1979, the ratio of \u0394SiO4 to \u0394NO3 was 1.4 and 2.5, respectively. The 1979 ratio supports the conclusion that high-nutrient utilization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8280051775061948305", "cites_id": ["8280051775061948305"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064599000752", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kfdoRjin6HIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 8, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 12, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
