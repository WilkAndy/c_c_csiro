Observations are used to propose the physical mechanism governing convection and to formulate a model of deep ventilation. The key physical mechanism governing deep\u2010water renewal is the so\u2010called thermobaric instability. Because the temperature of maximum density decreases with depth, a lake can become conditionally unstable if the base of the cold mixed layer is displaced to a depth at which its temperature matches the local temperature of maximum density, thereby resulting in sinking plumes. An important consequence of this phenomenon is that deep temperate lakes such as Baikal do not completely mix twice yearly; instead, deep ventilation is episodic.
