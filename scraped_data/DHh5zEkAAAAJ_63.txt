Biological uptake is modeled by conditionally restoring silicic acid in the euphotic zone to observed concentrations where the modeled concentrations exceed the observational climatology. An equivalent linear model is formulated to which Green\u2010function\u2010based transport diagnostics are applied. We find that the models' opal export through 133 m depth is 166\u2009\u00b1\u200924 Tmol Si/yr, with the Southern Ocean (SO) providing \u223c70% of this export, \u223c50% of which dissolves above 2000 m depth. The global\u2010scale gradients of the opal dissolution rate are primarily meridional, while the global\u2010scale gradients of phosphate remineralization are primarily vertical. The mean depth of the temperature\u2010dependent silicic\u2010acid regeneration reaches 2300 m in the SO, compared to 600 m for phosphate remineralization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8437877755531749283", "cites_id": ["8437877755531749283"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013JC009356", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o-ej5BxdGXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
