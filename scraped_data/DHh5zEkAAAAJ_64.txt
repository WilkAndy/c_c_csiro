Here we use a comprehensive set of ocean\u2013sea-ice simulations (1990\u20132007) to elucidate the drivers of the observed heterogeneous sea-ice trends. We show wind variability is an important determinant of the heterogeneous pattern of the variability and trends in Southern Hemisphere sea-ice. Only in the West Pacific region does Southern Annular Mode wind forcing contribute significantly to the trend in sea-ice duration. El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation wind forcing contribution to the sea-ice duration trend is confined to the Atlantic and Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, weather is a significant driver of the sea-ice duration trend. Only in the East Pacific region is wind forcing alone insufficient to give rise to the observed sea-ice decline \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2999261573983337928", "cites_id": ["2999261573983337928"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9656", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yH3BwYKEnykJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 14, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
