Using CORE data a comprehensive suite of experiments were carried out to elucidate excitation and amplification responses of this intrinsic mode to low frequency forcing (ENSO, SAM) and stochastic forcing due to high frequency winds. Subsurface anomalies were found to teleconnect the Pacific and Atlantic regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) thermocline. The Pacific region of the ACC is characterised by intrinsic baroclinic disturbances that respond to both SAM and ENSO, while the Atlantic sector of the ACC is sensitive to higher frequency winds that act to amplify thermocline anomalies propagating downstream from the Pacific. Non-stationary cluster analysis was used to identify the system\u2019s dynamical regimes and characterise meta-stability, persistence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15755936672344974696", "cites_id": ["15755936672344974696"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500313000759", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aCWsyuxUqNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 15, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
