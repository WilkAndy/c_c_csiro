Reliable assessments of how this mass depletion impacted whale populations, and projections of their recovery, are crucial but there are uncertainties regarding the status of Southern Hemisphere whale populations. We developed a Southern Hemisphere spatial \u201cModel of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem Assessments\u201d (MICE) for phytoplankton, krill (Euphausia superba) and five baleen whale species, to estimate whale population trajectories from 1890 to present. To forward project to 2100, we couple the predator\u2013prey model to a global climate model. We used the most up to date catch records, fitted to survey data and accounted for key uncertainties. We predict Antarctic blue (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia), fin (Balaenoptera physalus) and southern right (Eubalaena australis) whales will be at less than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:mVcUxdmZzz4C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17154720262102294785", "cites_id": ["17154720262102294785"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AaHNUzDPEe4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 15, "2020": 18, "2021": 5, "2022": 18, "2023": 3}}
