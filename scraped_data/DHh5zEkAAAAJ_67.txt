Increases in \u0394NO3, of 30\u201370% above the mean value occurred during four events (1969, 1971\u20101972, 1979, 1983). The \u0394NO3 time series was highly correlated (r = 0.86) with the spring\u2010summer nitrate utilization rate from 1970 to 1980. The \u0394NO3 time series was negatively correlated with the North Pacific index (NPI) (r = \u20100.72) and positively correlated with solar radiation in the spring (r = 0.48) and summer (r = 0.46). A simple ecosystem model forced with observed incident solar radiation and mixed\u2010layer depth during the spring\u2010summer period predicted increases in export production that were 50% of the observed increase for 1970\u20131972 and 1977\u20131979.
