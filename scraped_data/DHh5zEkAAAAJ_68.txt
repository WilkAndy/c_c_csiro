The observed decrease in \u039413CDIC at the surface, the Suess effect, was \u22120.015 \u00b1 0.003\u2030 yr\u22121 in the Sub\u2010Antarctic Zone and \u22120.005 \u00b1 0.003\u2030 yr\u22121 in the Antarctic Zone, similar to values reported for the southern Indian Ocean [Gruber et al; 1999; Sonnerup et al., 2000]. To compare the \u0394\u03b413CDIC with \u0394DIC, we used the ratio of these two anomalies (\u0394RC=\u2013\u0394\u03b413CDIC/\u0394DIC\u2030 (\u03bcmol; kg\u22121)\u22121). Along the section, \u0394RC ranged from 0.015 \u00b1 0.005 at 42\u00b0S to 0.007 \u00b1 0.005\u2030 (\u03bcmol; kg\u22121)\u22121 at 54\u00b0S. The spatial variability in \u0394RC in the Southern Ocean reflects different timescales for processes controlling the uptake of 13C from those controlling the uptake of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4286656714114474634", "cites_id": ["4286656714114474634"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000GB001352", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iiLW3pFDfTsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
