We also discuss the results of a study carried out with one of the models, which examines the effect of the subgrid-scale mixing parameterization. These sensitivity tests provide useful information to interpret the differences among the OCMIP models and between model simulations and the data. We find that the OCMIP models, which parameterize subgrid-scale mixing using an eddy-induced velocity, tend to underestimate the ventilation of the deep ocean, based on diagnostics with \u03b43He. In these models, this parameterization is implemented with a constant thickness diffusivity coefficient. In future simulations, we recommend using such a parameterization with spatially and temporally varying coefficients in order to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1325127834332773574", "cites_id": ["1325127834332773574"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796304000041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xjxjl77MYxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
