The refinement of BGC models through the assimilation of variables calculated from observed in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs), such as phytoplankton absorption, is problematic. Empirically derived relationships between IOPs and variables such as chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl a), total suspended solids (TSS) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been shown to have errors that can exceed 100\u202f% of the observed quantity. These errors are greatest in shallow coastal regions, such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), due to the additional signal from bottom reflectance. Rather than assimilate quantities calculated using IOP algorithms, this study demonstrates the advantages of assimilating quantities calculated directly from the less error-prone satellite remote-sensing reflectance (RSR). To assimilate the observed RSR, we use an in-water optical model to produce an equivalent simulated RSR and calculate the mismatch between the observed and simulated quantities to constrain the BGC model with a deterministic ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF). The traditional assumption that simulated surface Chl a is equivalent to the remotely sensed OC3M estimate of Chl a resulted in a forecast error of approximately 75\u202f%. We show this error can be halved by instead using simulated RSR to constrain the model via the assimilation system. When the analysis and forecast fields from the RSR-based assimilation system are compared with the non-assimilating model, a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:qyZFqkKsXusC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4491193735102617956", "cites_id": ["4491193735102617956"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/13/6441/2016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZFlAHujsUz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 18, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
