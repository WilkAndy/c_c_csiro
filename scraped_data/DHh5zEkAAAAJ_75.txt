The   biogeochemical models exhibit different structural complexities, ranging from simple   nutrient-restoring to multi-nutrient NPZD type models. We evaluate the simulations using the   observed volume distribution of phosphate. The errors in these simulated volume class   distributions are significantly larger when preformed phosphate (or regenerated phosphate) rather   than total phosphate is considered. Our analysis reveals that models can achieve similarly good   fits to observed total phosphate distributions for a~very different partitioning into preformed   and regenerated nutrient components. This has implications for the strength and potential climate   sensitivity of the simulated biological carbon pump. We suggest complementing the use of total   nutrient distributions for assessing model skill by an evaluation of the respective preformed and   regenerated nutrient components."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12170122228881229360", "cites_id": ["12170122228881229360"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/1797/2012/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MAaN5a_15KgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
