Natural seasonal variations in carbonate ion concentrations could either hasten or dampen the future onset of this undersaturation of calcium carbonate. We present a large-scale Southern Ocean observational analysis that examines the seasonal magnitude and variability of CO32\u2212 and pH. Our analysis shows an intense wintertime minimum in CO32\u2212 south of the Antarctic Polar Front and when combined with anthropogenic CO2 uptake is likely to induce aragonite undersaturation when atmospheric CO2 levels reach \u2248450 ppm. Under the IPCC IS92a scenario, Southern Ocean wintertime aragonite undersaturation is projected to occur by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 536, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7927529801438596207", "cites_id": ["7927529801438596207"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0806318105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bwwSQVo-BG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 21, "2010": 29, "2011": 47, "2012": 53, "2013": 52, "2014": 42, "2015": 43, "2016": 44, "2017": 32, "2018": 47, "2019": 31, "2020": 27, "2021": 22, "2022": 24, "2023": 12}}
