From sensitivity studies that varied both the initial ocean flux distribution and the atmospheric data used in the inversion, our inversion predicted a total (ocean and land) uptake of 1.65\u20131.90 Gt C yr\u22121. We assess the consistency between the mean southern hemisphere ocean uptake predicted by an atmospheric inversion model for the 1991\u20131997 period and the T99 ocean flux estimate based on observed \u0394pCO2 in Takahashi et al. (2002; Deep-Sea Res II, 49, 1601\u20131622). The inversion can not match the large 1.8 Gt C yr\u22121 southern extratropical (20\u201390\u00b0S) uptake of the T99 ocean flux estimate without producing either unreasonable land fluxes in the southern mid-latitudes or by increasing the mismatches between observed and simulated atmospheric CO2 data. The southern extratropical uptake is redistributed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3353101874500514367", "cites_id": ["3353101874500514367"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/tellusb.v55i2.16749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P7JMrWOciC4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 8, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
