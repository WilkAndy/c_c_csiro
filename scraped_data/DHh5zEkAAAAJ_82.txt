Thecosomata (shelled pteropod molluscs) are calcifiers that play an important role in the ocean carbonate cycle. Ocean acidification as a result of the uptake of CO2 affects pteropods by increasing dissolution rates of their aragonite skeletons. Two species of pteropod found in Australian tropical waters were studied, Creseis acicula and Diacavolinia longirostris. To assess the changes in their aragonite shells, shell morphology, growth patterns, structure, size, and porosity are described for both species, from material collected at seven sites between the 1960s and the \u2026Roger, L.
