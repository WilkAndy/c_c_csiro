Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is capable of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and surface warming and addressing ocean acidification. Here, we simulate global and regional responses to alkalinity (ALK) addition (0.25\u2009PmolALK\u2009yr\u22121) over the period 2020\u20132100 using the CSIRO-Mk3L-COAL Earth System Model, under high (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) emissions. While regionally there are large changes in alkalinity associated with locations of AOA, globally we see only a very weak dependence on where and when AOA is applied. On a global scale, while we see that under RCP2.6 the carbon uptake associated with AOA is only \u223c\u200960\u2009% of the total, under RCP8.5 the relative changes in temperature are larger, as are the changes in pH (140\u2009%) and aragonite saturation state (170\u2009%). The simulations reveal AOA is more effective under lower emissions, therefore the higher the emissions the more AOA is required to achieve the same reduction in global warming and ocean acidification. Finally, our simulated AOA for 2020\u20132100 in the RCP2.6 scenario is capable of offsetting warming and ameliorating ocean acidification increases at the global scale, but with highly variable regional responses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:4kG_yR6n1dAC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3336857114203884564", "cites_id": ["3336857114203884564"], "pub_url": "https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/9/339/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FIxbrt3lTi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 8}}
