Reported ecological and economic impacts of marine heatwaves include coral bleaching, local extinction of mangrove and kelp forests and elevated mortalities of invertebrates, fishes, seabirds and marine mammals. In contrast, little is known about the impacts of marine heatwaves on microbes that regulate biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Here we analyse the daily output of a near\u2010global ocean physical\u2013biogeochemical model simulation to characterize the impacts of marine heatwaves on phytoplankton blooms in 23 tropical and temperate oceanographic regions from 1992 to 2014. The results reveal regionally coherent anomalies of shallower surface mixing layers and lower surface nitrate concentrations during marine heatwaves. These anomalies exert \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:n94QCav8jycC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3186848702025825887", "cites_id": ["3186848702025825887"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X_4phQL2OSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 12, "2022": 21, "2023": 10}}
