Data assimilation experiments were performed using simulated annealing to obtain parameter estimates of a simple nitrogen based mixed-layer marine ecosystem model at two locations in this region (station P1 at 140\u00b0E, 46.5\u00b0S and station P3 at 152\u00b0E, 45.5\u00b0S). The assimilation methods and parameter sensitivities are assessed in a twin experiment. This assessment determined that inversion method was successful at estimating the correct parameters but that only a sub-set of the model parameters can be uniquely determined using chlorophyll a observations. An analysis of parameter uncertainties shows at both stations accurate parameterisations of phytoplankton growth and zooplankton mortality, and the biological recycling processes are required \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5882100339551664887", "cites_id": ["5882100339551664887"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064511001445", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:93ouGBhroVEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
