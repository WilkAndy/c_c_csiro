All phytoplankton rely on ribulose\u2010bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RUBISCO) for assimilation of inorganic carbon in photosynthesis, but this enzyme is inefficient at present day CO2 levels. Many algae have developed a range of energy demanding mechanisms, referred to as carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), which increase the efficiency of carbon acquisition. We investigated CCM activity in three southern hemisphere strains of the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi W. W. Hay & H. P. Mohler. Both calcifying and non\u2010calcifying strains showed strong CCM activity, with HCO3\u2212 as a preferred source of photosynthetic carbon in the non\u2010calcifying strain, but a higher preference for CO2 in the calcifying strains. All three strains were characterized by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7299965817880674011", "cites_id": ["7299965817880674011"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpy.12074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:235FBzywTmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
