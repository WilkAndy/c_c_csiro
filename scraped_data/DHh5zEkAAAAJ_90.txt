Observations of pCO2 were used to validate the statistical properties of the model and to estimate the mesoscale variability not captured by the model resolution. Sampling regularly every 3 months, at every 30\u00b0 in longitude and 3\u00b0 in latitude is sufficient to determine the net Southern Ocean CO2 uptake. We applied this sampling strategy to the simulated air\u2010sea fluxes to estimate a net annual mean CO2 uptake of 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 PgC/yr (1990\u20131999). This uncertainty in the estimate was dominated by the simulated interannual variability, and not by errors in the sampling or unresolved mesoscale variability. Therefore sampling at higher \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9319140379082706701", "cites_id": ["9319140379082706701"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005GB002620", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DU85w8w8VIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
