However, the spatial resolution of these models is inadequate to resolve mesoscale processes that dominate variability in boundary current regions where societal and economic impacts of marine heatwaves are substantial. Here we compare the historical and projected changes in marine heatwaves in a 0.1\u00b0 ocean model with 23 coarser-resolution climate models. Western boundary currents are the regions where the models disagree the most with observations and among themselves in simulating marine heatwaves of the past and the future. The lack of eddy-driven variability in the coarse-resolution models results in less intense marine heatwaves over the historical period and greater intensification in the coming decades. Although the projected changes agree well at the global scale, the greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:_Nt1UvVys9QC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17976844147059498547", "cites_id": ["17976844147059498547"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18241-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M54KoIGUevkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 15, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
