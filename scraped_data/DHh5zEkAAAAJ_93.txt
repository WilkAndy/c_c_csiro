By using a high-resolution ocean model forced by the simulated climate of the 2060s, we investigate whether enhanced spatial resolution and bias correction of the mean state could alter the climate change projection for the western tropical Pacific and examine the consequences this might have for tropical tuna distributions. For most of the physical environmental variables, enhanced resolution and bias correction had only a minor impact on the projected changes. The climate projections showed a maximum surface warming east of the Warm Pool, a shoaling of the thermocline in the Warm Pool, and an eastward expansion of the Warm Pool. In the Warm Pool, the shoaling of the thermocline raises the nutricline into the photic zone and increases phytoplankton \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3360634205505646943", "cites_id": ["3360634205505646943"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064514001751", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X_EwJwFfoy4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
