Substantial improvements are required if we are to achieve a better understanding of present-day biogeochemical properties and processes in the ocean and to predict potential future responses to perturbations resulting from human activities. We have made significant progress in this regard and expect even greater strides over the next decade as the synthesis of JGOFS data sets is completed and disseminated to the broader scientific community."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13970608290004672551", "cites_id": ["13970608290004672551"], "pub_url": "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8dg2q260", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JyDbZTiS4cEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
