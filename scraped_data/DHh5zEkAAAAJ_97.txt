As the western Australian region is oligotrophic this anomalous feature must be related to differing nutrient supply pathways to the surface mixed layer of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. A suite of modelled abiotic tracers suggests that cyclonic eddies are predominantly supplied by diapycnal processes that remain relatively weak until June\u2013July, when they rapidly increase because of deepening surface mixed layers, which start to tap into the nutrient-replete waters below the euphotic zone. To the contrary, we find that anticyclonic eddies are predominantly supplied by injection of shelf waters, which carry elevated levels of inorganic nutrients and biomass. These injections start with the formation of the eddies in April\u2013May \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17070933428769206396", "cites_id": ["17070933428769206396"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063709000818", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fDAh_oEj6OwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
