In this study, we review the dominant multi\u2010decadal trends of ocean boundary currents around Australia. Using an eddy\u2010resolving global ocean circulation model, this study has revealed that the major ocean boundary current systems around Australia, the East Australian Current (EAC), the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF), the Leeuwin Current, the South Australian Current and the Flinders Current, have strengthened during 1979\u20132014, consistent with existing observations. Eddy energetics in the EAC, the ITF/South Equatorial Current in the southeast Indian Ocean, and the Leeuwin Current have also enhanced during the same period. The multi\u2010decadal strengthening of the ocean boundary current systems are primarily driven by large scale wind patterns \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DHh5zEkAAAAJ:nnVijz9KPVYC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7996320901730849842", "cites_id": ["7996320901730849842"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JC011842", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MtSyaX6j-G4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
