Thus land use management and rehabilitation strategies will have an impact on catchment water balance and hence water yield and groundwater recharge. The key controls on evapotranspiration are rainfall interception, net radiation, advection, turbulent transport, leaf area, and plant\u2010available water capacity. The relative importance of these factors depends on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions. Results from over 250 catchments worldwide show that for a given forest cover, there is a good relationship between long\u2010term average evapotranspiration and rainfall. From these observations and on the basis of previous theoretical work a simple two\u2010parameter model was developed that relates mean annual evapotranspiration to rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and plant\u2010available water capacity.
