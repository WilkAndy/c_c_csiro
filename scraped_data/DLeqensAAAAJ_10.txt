The concept of climate elasticity was used to assess the impacts of climate and land surface change on the streamflow. Results show that for the period 1960\u20132000 the elasticity of streamflow in relation to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are 2.10 and \u22121.04, respectively, indicating that streamflow is more sensitive to precipitation than to potential evapotranspiration. However, land use change played a more important role than climate in reducing streamflow in the 1990s. It is estimated that land use change is responsible for more than 70% of the streamflow reduction in the 1990s, while climate change contributed to less than 30% of the reduction. The precipitation elasticity appears to have an inverse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 446, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17709202628095305995", "cites_id": ["17709202628095305995"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007wr006665", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C-kIf_a5w_UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 20, "2013": 23, "2014": 28, "2015": 31, "2016": 34, "2017": 38, "2018": 41, "2019": 47, "2020": 46, "2021": 50, "2022": 51, "2023": 24}}
