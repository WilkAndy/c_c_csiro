The climate of the region also exhibited some levels of change with decreased precipitation and increased temperature. This study combined the time\u2010trend analysis method with a sensitivity\u2010based approach and found that annual streamflow in the Loess Plateau decreased significantly since the 1950s and surface runoff trends appear to dominate the streamflow trends in most of the catchments. Annual baseflow exhibited mostly downward trends, but significant upward trends were also observed in 3 out of 38 gauging stations. Mean annual streamflow during 1979\u22122010 decreased by up to 65% across the catchments compared with the period of 1957\u22121978, indicating significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11571343323157673158", "cites_id": ["11571343323157673158"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.10704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xrTm3nGrlaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
