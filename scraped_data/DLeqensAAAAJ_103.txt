While climate change perturbs the streamflow and affects flood events, reservoir operation may mitigate or aggravate this impact. Therefore, quantitative assessment of the climate change impact and reservoir effect on the LMRB is a vital prerequisite for future hydropower development and environmental protection. This study aimed to estimate the variation of the streamflow and flood characteristics affected by climate change and reservoir operation within the LMRB. A reservoir module was incorporated into the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to simulate the streamflow susceptible to the reservoirs. It was found that the reservoirs had a substantial influence on the streamflow during 2008\u20132016, when many reservoirs were constructed in the LMRB. The reservoirs across the Lancang River (the upper \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10430875870235130951", "cites_id": ["10430875870235130951"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216942030932X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R_yOvVbqwZAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 15, "2022": 24, "2023": 15}}
