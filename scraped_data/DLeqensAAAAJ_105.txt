The research is motivated by low-flow frequency analysis in water resources research. Three commonly used parameter estimation methods were evaluated, including the method of moments, probability-weighted moments (or L-moments) and maximum likelihood method. The computing issues in the parameter estimation are also discussed. The performance of the proposed distribution is examined using a simulation study and real data from large number of catchments from Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5622390143097663332", "cites_id": ["5622390143097663332"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947307002526", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZG_-4wu-Bk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 0, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
