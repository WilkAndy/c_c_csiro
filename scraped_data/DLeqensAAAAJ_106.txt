Although the physics of evaporation is well understood, its estimation in practice remains a challenge. Among available methods for estimating it, the complementary principle of Bouchet has the potential to provide a practical tool for regional water resources assessment. In this study, the generalized nonlinear formulation of this principle by Brutsaert (2015) was tested against evaporation measurements from four flux stations in Australia under different climatic and vegetation conditions. The method was implemented using meteorological data and Class A pan evaporation measurements. After calibration the estimated daily evaporation values were in good agreement with flux station measurements with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.83 and a bias of 4% on average. More accurate estimates of daily evaporation were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9544815415036009192", "cites_id": ["9544815415036009192"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016JD025936", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6Nrkowz_dYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 17, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
