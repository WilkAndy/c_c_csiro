Detailed measurements at 2, 12, and 32 m above the ground surface during the growing seasons of 2004\u20132007 allowed validation of a generalized nonlinear form of this approach above the highly variable terrain in Changwu County in the southern Loess Plateau of the Yellow River basin in China. The obtained values of the parameters were found to lie well within the ranges to be expected on physical grounds or from previous measurements by different experimental means; calibration on the basis of any one year of data allowed predictions within roughly 5% on average. Relative to the corresponding observed turbulent vapor fluxes, the evaporation rates calculated with measurements at the highest level of 32 m displayed the least scatter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5982875851582241111", "cites_id": ["5982875851582241111"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016wr019472", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V3nSbONxB1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 16, "2021": 15, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
