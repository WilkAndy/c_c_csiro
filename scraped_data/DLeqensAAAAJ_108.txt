It is important to evaluate the effects of vegetation cover change on streamflow as changes in streamflow relate to water security. This study focuses on the use of statistical methods to determine responses in streamflow at seven paired catchments in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa to vegetation change. The non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Kendall test and Pettitt's test were used to identify trends and change points in the annual streamflow records. Statistically significant trends in annual streamflow were detected for most of the treated catchments. It took between 3 and 10\u2009years for a change in vegetation cover to result in significant change in annual streamflow. Presence of the change points in streamflow was associated with changes in the mean, variance, and distribution of annual streamflow. The streamflow in the deforestation catchments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5044022455012712805", "cites_id": ["5044022455012712805"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.8266", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZWEgzrL3_0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
