This study investigated the impacts of climate change and revegetation on water and salt balance, and stream salt concentration for catchments within the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The Biophysical Capacity to Change model was used with climate change scenarios obtained using the CSIRO DARLAM 125 (125 km resolution) and Cubic Conformal (50 km resolution) regional climate models. These models predicted up to 25% reduction in mean annual rainfall and a similar magnitude of increase in potential evapotranspiration by 2070. Relatively modest changes in rainfall and temperature can lead to significant reductions in mean annual runoff and salt yield and increases in stream salt concentrations within the Basin. The modelled reductions in mean annual runoff were up to 45% in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16540865032870565541", "cites_id": ["16540865032870565541"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-009-9714-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pRbuMRz1jOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
