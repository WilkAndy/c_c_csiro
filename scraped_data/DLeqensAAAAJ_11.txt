To reduce sediment yield from the catchment, large\u2010scale soil conservation measures have been implemented in the last four decades. These included building terraces and sediment\u2010trapping dams and changing land cover by planting trees and improving pastures. It is important to assess the impact of these measures on the hydrology of the catchment and to provide a scientific basis for future soil conservation planning. The non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Kendall\u2013Sneyers rank test was employed to detect trends and changes in annual streamflow for the period of 1961 to 1997. Two methods were used to assess the impact of climate variability on mean annual streamflow. The first is based on a framework describing the sensitivity of annual streamflow to precipitation and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 430, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1562439813776840322", "cites_id": ["1562439813776840322"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6485", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gpYYg7vmrhUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 11, "2010": 21, "2011": 21, "2012": 33, "2013": 27, "2014": 33, "2015": 36, "2016": 43, "2017": 30, "2018": 31, "2019": 50, "2020": 26, "2021": 30, "2022": 23, "2023": 7}}
