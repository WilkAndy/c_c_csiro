Plot and field experiments were used to obtain the crop water sensitivity index, the salinity sensitivity index, and other parameters. Using data collected during 35 years to calculate the 10-day mean precipitation and evaporation, the variation in soil salinity concentrations and in the yields of winter wheat and cotton were simulated for 49 irrigation scheduling that were combined from 7 irrigation schemes over 3 irrigation dates and 7 salinity concentrations of saline irrigation water (fresh water and 6 levels of saline water). Comparison of predicted results with irrigation data obtained from a large area of the field showed that the model was valid and reliable. Based on the analysis of the investment cost of the irrigation that employed deep tube \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13327967144745864798", "cites_id": ["13327967144745864798"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100201600760037X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xo6n6IBz9rgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
