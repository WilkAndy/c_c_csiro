The total differential of runoff within the Budyko framework, which has been widely used to attribute the change in runoff to the effect of climate and catchment changes, is not precise in which there is always some residual between the observed and estimated change in runoff. The objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a new partition method based on the Budyko complementary relationship for runoff. Algebraic identities have ensured that the change in runoff can be decomposed into two components precisely without any residuals using this complementary method. In addition, the complementary method allows estimation of the upper and lower bounds of the climate effect and catchment effect. The new method was compared with the total differential method and an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12995739917839498667", "cites_id": ["12995739917839498667"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016WR019046", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q_0v1JkkWrQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
