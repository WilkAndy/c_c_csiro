Previous studies mainly focused on ecosystem WUE for forests, grasslands and farmlands, but paid little attention to the sparse vineyard. How the vineyard WUE varied on daily and seasonal time scales remains uncertain. The vineyard CO2 and water fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance method during 2008 in arid northwest China to address the issues. Results indicate that the seasonal variation of vineyard WUE presented a downward-parabolic trend, with a mean value of 4 mg g\u22121and a maximum value of 10 mg g\u22121. Compared with other ecosystems, WUE for vineyard was lower than that for forests, maize, wheat and wetlands, but higher than grasslands and Savannas.
