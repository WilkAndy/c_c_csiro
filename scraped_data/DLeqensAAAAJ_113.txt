This study compares three methods for estimating ET: field Water Balance (WB), Eddy Covariance (EC) and Bowen Ratio-Energy Balance (BREB). The experiment was conducted in a vineyard in the arid desert regions of northwest China. Results indicate that the three methods provided similar estimate of total ET. Compared to total ET measured by WB (ET WB) during the whole growing stage, total ET estimated by EC (ET EC) was 1\u00b7 57% lower, and total ET estimated by BREB (ET BREB) was 5\u00b7 19% higher. Variations of ET EC and ET BREB are similar at hourly or daily timescale, but the values are slightly different. At sunrise or sunset, ET BREB increases or decreases more rapidly than ET EC. The difference between ET \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8133297270598629657", "cites_id": ["8133297270598629657"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.7059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GXmvisZG33AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
