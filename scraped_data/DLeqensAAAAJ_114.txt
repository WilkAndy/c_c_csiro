The present study examines the pattern of vineyard EF after monitoring energy components by eddy covariance for 2 years, and estimates the crop ET by EF in the arid desert region of Northwest China. Main results indicate that EF during daytime is nearly constant on sunny days when the available energy exceeds 200Wm\u22122, but EF becomes relatively unsteady when the available energy is lower than 200Wm\u22122. Furthermore, daytime average EF is relatively low in the early growth stage, nearly constant in the mid-later stage, and significantly reduced in the later stage; Moreover, mean EF in different periods of daytime is in good agreement with daytime average EF, mean EF during 10:00\u201315:00h is relatively close to daytime average EF and mean EF during 14:00\u201315 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16130365372125035778", "cites_id": ["16130365372125035778"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377408000760", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Aj3G9teR2t8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 2}}
