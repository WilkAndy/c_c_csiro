The FDC characterizes the relationship between the magnitude and frequency and hence provides the complete range of streamflow over time. Two issues need to be considered in predicting the FDC due to land-use changes: (a) the appropriate parametric form of the FDC that enables application of the same expression of FDCs before and after the changes; and (b) the ability of parameters to capture and characterize the effect of land-use changes. In this paper, we propose a model which is a four-parameter double power form as a function of the FDC, where the two hydrological parameters represent the mean annual flow ([Qbar]) and the cease-to-flow point (\u03c4 expressed as a percentage), while the other two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15498122679757412730", "cites_id": ["15498122679757412730"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1623/hysj.54.3.606", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:epld9HZkFNcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
