Measurements of energy balance components using the Bowen ratio method were made for a complete growing season at a vineyard in the arid region of northwest China. Vine in the experiment was furrow\u2010irrigated using a trellis system. The measured evapotranspiration was compared with estimates using the soil water balance method. It is shown that the Bowen ratio method provided accurate estimates of evapotranspiration from the vineyard and this requires that the Bowen ratio system is appropriately installed. The energy balance components showed typical diurnal pattern with peaks that occurred around the midday, except for the ground heat flux which delayed its peak by 2\u20133 h. The sensible heat flux was greater than the latent heat flux and followed the net radiation closely. The ratio of the latent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11683983960965396619", "cites_id": ["11683983960965396619"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:izi0EoLZJaIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 9, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
