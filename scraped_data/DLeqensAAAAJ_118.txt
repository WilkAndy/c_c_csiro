This simple statement has important implications for managing dryland salinity and changes in river flows. Until recently the data analysis and predictive tools only permitted confidence in predictions concerning river flows on a mean annual basis. This limited the use of the science in the day-to-day management of water resources and catchment planning.This report bridges part of the gap between the science of catchment water balances and the management of catchments. The language has moved from \u201cannual average yield\u201d to \u201cwater security\u201d. Afforestation and water remains a contentious issue. This report sets out an important case study to underpin future decisionmaking."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11384452002505431567", "cites_id": ["11384452002505431567"], "pub_url": "https://www.ewater.org.au/archive/crcch/overview/archive/pubs/pdfs/technical200305.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DxrSY8ey_Z0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
