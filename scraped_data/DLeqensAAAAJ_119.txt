However, as groundwater storage sustains low flows in catchments during dry periods, groundwater storage can also be estimated indirectly from daily streamflow based on hydraulic groundwater theory; this idea was applied herein to 17 selected Australian catchments to examine their long-term (half a century or longer) groundwater storage trends. On average, over past 45 years, groundwater storage exhibited negative trends in all the selected catchments, except in the Katherine River catchment located in the Northern Territory. These negative trends persisted over longer periods, close to 100 years in some catchments and the strongest decreasing trend of 0.241 mm per year was observed in the Barron River catchment in New South Wales.
