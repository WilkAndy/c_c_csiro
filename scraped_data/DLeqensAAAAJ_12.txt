However, as a result of rapid regional development in the last two decades the competition for water has become very acute. This presents a serious problem for the sustainable agriculture in the region. This work examines relationships between irrigation, evapotranspiration (ET), crop growth and water use efficiency (WUE)of a corn\u2013wheat rotation common in the region. During the period of 1984\u20131996 field experiments were conducted at Luancheng Agricultural Ecosystem Station in the North China Plain to measure water and energy balance components and crop growth of corn and wheat. A process-based model (WAVES) was used to analyse the measurements and to simulate the effect of irrigation management on crop growth. The summer dominant rainfall of the region means that irrigation is required during the winter wheat growing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 341, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8568376993364121127", "cites_id": ["8568376993364121127"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377400001189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JxYZb3r96HYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 10, "2005": 10, "2006": 11, "2007": 11, "2008": 11, "2009": 8, "2010": 22, "2011": 28, "2012": 16, "2013": 29, "2014": 20, "2015": 27, "2016": 20, "2017": 18, "2018": 16, "2019": 27, "2020": 14, "2021": 18, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
