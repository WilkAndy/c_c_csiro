The current research status of drylands globally was reviewed together with a conceptual framework that included four key themes: (1) dryland social-ecological system dynamics and driving forces, (2) dryland social-ecological system structure and functions, (3) dryland ecosystem services and human well-being in a changing environment and society, and (4) ecosystem management and sustainable livelihoods in drylands. The themes and their linkages were then analysed to outline three research priorities under each theme. The resulting conceptual framework and research priorities were proposed as the agenda of a new scientific programme, the Global Dryland Ecosystem Programme (Global-DEP), which is intended to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7068012088084288601", "cites_id": ["7068012088084288601"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343520300634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WVRu0oufFmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 15, "2022": 15, "2023": 13}}
