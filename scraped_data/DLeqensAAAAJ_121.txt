As competition for water intensifies between the agricultural and industrial sectors, it is essential to improve the agricultural water use efficiency (WUE) in the region. This requires the development of alternative irrigation schedules that maximize WUE. A field experiment was conducted for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during the period 1995\u20131998 to calibrate and test a biophysically based model WAVES in terms of grain yield and WUE predictions. Different irrigation treatments were carried out and the data collected included water and energy balance components, biomass, and grain yield. The model was run for 3 years with the measured meteorological data and grain yield was modeled using two different formulations. Comparisons between the measurements and the model predictions were made with 3 years of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18229023824019286154", "cites_id": ["18229023824019286154"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X03000374", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:imjNIJaA-vwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
