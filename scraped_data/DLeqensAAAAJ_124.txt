The depth of groundwater table was set to 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.50 m, respectively. The results showed that the rate of capillary contribution from groundwater to crop root-zone was influenced mainly by the depth of the water tables. The daily variation in capillary contribution was not the same as pan evaporation; the peak was delayed when the water table was >0.8 m, and the time of delay increased with the depth of water table. The crop evapotranspiration was decreased with increasing groundwater table in the early growth period and harvest period. The maximum evapotranspiration occurred at 1.2 m groundwater table in the other periods.
