Here, several stringent criteria are proposed for automated selection of base flows for this method and are applied to select pure base flows in 26 catchments from the United States, Australia, and China. The characteristic drainage timescale parameter () of the linear response function was chosen as the effectiveness measure of the automated method; the  values estimated using this method are  days compared with  estimated manually for the catchments with long records. The effects of different imposed criteria on the base flow selection are also quantified using this parameter. The proposed algorithm provides a faster and more objective methodology for automated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18283631778734498281", "cites_id": ["18283631778734498281"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001427", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6WGDXzuCvP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
