Methods have been developed to predict the effects of vegetation change on water yield or total streamflow. However, it is still a challenge to predict changes in base flow following vegetation change due to limited understanding of catchment storage\u2010discharge dynamics. In this study, the power law relationship for describing catchment storage\u2010discharge dynamics is reformulated to quantify the changes in storage\u2010discharge relationship resulting from vegetation changes using streamflow data from six paired\u2010catchment experiments, of which two are deforestation catchments and four are afforestation catchments. Streamflow observations from the paired\u2010catchment experiments clearly demonstrate that vegetation changes have led to significant changes in catchment storage\u2010discharge relationships, accounting for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14979795722768117187", "cites_id": ["14979795722768117187"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017WR020600", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w22C79fs4s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 15, "2022": 11, "2023": 1}}
