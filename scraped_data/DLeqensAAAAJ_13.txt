The aim of the work was specific, to estimate the effects of afforestation or deforestation on run-off that leads to recharge to some of the alluvial catchments in the upland areas of the Murray-Darling Basin. The method proved to be more successful than expected, leading to simple robust estimators at an appropriate scale. Having done this, the method could be used much more widely than its original purpose, providing a basis for making estimates of the water yield impacts of wide-scale afforestation in the Murray-Darling Basin. This report substantiates the estimators, both from a process understanding and a statistical analysis of a large number of catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 331, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9598400754637661249", "cites_id": ["9598400754637661249"], "pub_url": "https://ewater.org.au/archive/crcch/archive/pubs/pdfs/technical199912.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QeQEwKFeNIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 8, "2002": 7, "2003": 12, "2004": 16, "2005": 13, "2006": 15, "2007": 14, "2008": 22, "2009": 12, "2010": 12, "2011": 16, "2012": 22, "2013": 21, "2014": 16, "2015": 17, "2016": 19, "2017": 16, "2018": 20, "2019": 15, "2020": 8, "2021": 15, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
