This study investigated these responses using a modelling approach. The biophysically based model WAVES was calibrated and validated with more than two years of field experimental data conducted in Mulga (Acacia aneura) in arid central Australia. The validated model was then applied to simulate vegetation growth (as changes in overstory and understory leaf area index; LAI), vegetation water-use and groundwater recharge using observed climate data for the period 1981\u20132012. Due to large inter-annual climatic variability, especially precipitation, simulated annual mean LAI ranged from 0.12 to 0.35 for the overstory and 0.07 to 0.21 for the understory. These variations in simulated LAI resulted in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10965290892755014243", "cites_id": ["10965290892755014243"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169414006428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YxJ9afiJLJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
