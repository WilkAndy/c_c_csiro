This study evaluated the effect of spatial rainfall variability on water balance modelling by conducting a series of virtual experiments. The three-layer Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC-3L) was applied using both uniform and spatially variable rainfall for 60 catchments in south-eastern Australia. The spatially variable rainfall was generated from the 0.05\u00b0 gridded SILO daily rainfall with different degrees of variability. The VIC-3L model was calibrated against observed daily streamflow using gridded SILO daily rainfall to generate reference parameter values. Then the model was applied using the generated spatially variable rainfall and reference parameter values to produce virtual water balance components associated with different spatially variable rainfall.
