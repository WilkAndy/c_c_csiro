Future investigations will also focus on the role of farm dams in contributing to the unexpected decline in runoff during the drought. During drought conditions farm dams will intercept a greater proportion of flow than during wet conditions. Understanding how catchments behave in times of drought may provide insights into how best to adapt hydrological models to better simulate runoff under drier climates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17909402506533008869", "cites_id": ["17909402506533008869"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cuan-Petheram/publication/265102735_Towards_better_understanding_of_changes_in_rainfall-_runoff_relationships_during_the_recent_drought_in_south-_eastern_Australia/links/546fecdc0cf2d67fc0311e95/Towards-better-understanding-of-changes-in-rainfall-runoff-relationships-during-the-recent-drought-in-south-eastern-Australia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5fVjDbH6ivgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4}}
