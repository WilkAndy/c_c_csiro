This model (PRI-ET) was mainly based on the Shuttleworth\u2013Wallace (S-W) model and took into consideration the differences in soil water content between furrow-irrigation ditch and ridge under the PRI scheme and variable canopy shading over the surface. Estimates of ET and its components (plant transpiration and soil evaporation) by the PRI-ET and S-W models were compared to ET, plant transpiration and soil evaporation measured by Bowen ratio\u2013energy balance, heat-pulse sap flow sensor and micro-lysimeter, respectively. The PRI-ET model can estimate the vineyard ET and its components more accurately than the S-W model, indicating that the PRI-ET model is suitable for estimating vineyard ET \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8803213844916182269", "cites_id": ["8803213844916182269"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192309001725", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_ZwHvFlMK3oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
