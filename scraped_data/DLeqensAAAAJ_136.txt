Reservoirs can be managed effectively mitigate the risks of these extreme events. However, current knowledge about changes in hydrological extreme events under climate change and the effectiveness of reservoir regulation in LMRB remains limited. This study fills the knowledge gap by evaluating the effectiveness of reservoir regulation for changing hydrological extremes in the 21st century. The VIC-Reservoir hydrological model forced by the bias-corrected CMIP6 climate forcing data were used to project the future streamflow changes in LMRB, and the copula-based joint Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) was adopted to identify basin-wide dry and wet hydrological extremes. Our results indicate that the streamflow in LMRB will first decrease \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9818743169996841634", "cites_id": ["9818743169996841634"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721023937", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:omJ0JOQuQ4gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 20, "2023": 10}}
