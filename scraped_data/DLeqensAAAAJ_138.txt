It assumes, in the long-term, that precipitation is the only source of water availability for evapotranspiration while the changes in soil water storage are negligible. For arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables, however, groundwater also can supply crop water demand in addition to irrigation and precipitation. In this study, we present a new Budyko formula considering seasonal groundwater uptake and soil water storage changes estimated by Aver\u2019yanov\u2019s equation and abcd model, respectively. The use of groundwater depths rather than the variation of groundwater levels makes it more reasonable to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption. For the application of the Budyko equation in unsteady state areas, equivalent precipitation was designed to take the place of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12104443807982792989", "cites_id": ["12104443807982792989"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169419312314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HbF94oKf-6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
