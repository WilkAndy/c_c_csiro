This paper assesses the application of the widely used macroscale hydrologic model, the three-layer Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC-3L), to estimate daily streamflow in 191 unregulated catchments across southeast Australia and evaluates the regionalization of model parameters to predict streamflow in ungauged catchments. The parameter values in the VIC-3L model are estimated using three methods: default values, optimized values based on model calibration, and regionalized values based on spatial proximity method. The modeled streamflows from VIC-3L are assessed against the observed streamflows from the catchments. The authors discuss the model performance based on different parameter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12752731053470084876", "cites_id": ["12752731053470084876"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/13/4/jhm-d-11-0114_1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DG8thlPN-rAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
