This paper estimates the hydrological sensitivity, measured as the percentage change in mean annual runoff, of two lumped parameter rainfall-runoff models, SIMHYD and AWBM and an empirical model, Zhang01, to changes in rainfall and potential evaporation. These changes are estimated for 22 Australian catchments covering a range of climates, from cool temperate to tropical and moist to arid. The results show that the models display different sensitivities to both rainfall and potential evaporation changes. The SIMHYD, AWBM and Zhang01 models show mean sensitivities of 2.4%, 2.5% and 2.1% change in mean annual flow for every 1% change in mean annual rainfall, respectively. All rainfall sensitivities have a lower limit of 1.8% and show upper limits of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 323, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10083978231490339382", "cites_id": ["10083978231490339382"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170805002654", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NuLAOsZ88YsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 12, "2009": 16, "2010": 20, "2011": 20, "2012": 24, "2013": 14, "2014": 25, "2015": 27, "2016": 24, "2017": 22, "2018": 16, "2019": 19, "2020": 17, "2021": 21, "2022": 24, "2023": 12}}
