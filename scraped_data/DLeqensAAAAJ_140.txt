To address this question, an eddy covariance system was applied to measure energy balance over a vineyard in northwest China during 2005\u20132006. Result indicated that 2-year average Bowen ratio (\u03b2) of vineyard was 1.0, canopy resistance (rc) 289.3sm\u22121, aerodynamic resistance (ra) 9.7sm\u22121 and climatological resistance (ri) 117sm\u22121. This implied that the annual energy was split almost equally between sensible heat and latent heat. Compared to the corresponding values in other ecosystems reported by Wilson et al.
