Meanwhile, simulation of hydrological cycle has long been regarded as an important tool for the assessment, utilization and protection of water resources. In this paper, a new tool named Hydro-Informatic Modelling System (HIMS) has been developed and introduced with case studies in the Yellow River Basin in China and 331 catchments in Australia. The case studies showed that HIMS can be employed as an integrated platform for hydrological simulation in different regions. HIMS is a modular based framework of hydrological model designed for different utilization such as flood forecasting, water resources planning and evaluating hydrological impacts of climate change and human activities. The unique of HIMS is its flexibility in providing alternative modules in the simulation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18161413959023183700", "cites_id": ["18161413959023183700"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11431-008-0040-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VMdlvsVNCvwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
