Here, we categorize the secular trend in global vegetation greenness into sustained greening, sustained browning and greening-to-browning. We found that by 2016, increased global vegetation greenness had begun to level off, with the area of browning increasing in the last decade, reaching 39.0 million km2 (35.9% of the world\u2019s vegetated area). This area is larger than the area with sustained increasing growth (27.8 million km2, 26.4%); thus, 12.0% \u00b1 3.1% (0.019 \u00b1 0.004 NDVI a\u22121) of the previous earlier increase has been offset since 2010 (2010\u20132016, P < 0.05). Global gross primary production also leveled off, following the trend in vegetation greenness in time and space. This leveling off was caused by increasing soil water limitations due to the spatial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17591636590125197788", "cites_id": ["17591636590125197788"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209592732100164X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3CktNEYMIvQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 14, "2023": 13}}
