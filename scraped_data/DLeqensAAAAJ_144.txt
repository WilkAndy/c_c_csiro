The research must be underpinned by information on how much water there is in a basin, where it goes and how it is used. There should, furthermore, be an understanding of future constraints (such as the impact of climate change), opportunities (such as increased diversions for irrigation) and trade-offs (such as changed land use improving dryland productivity but leaving less water for downstream use). We describe water use account spreadsheets to provide monthly estimates of major water movement, uses and losses within a river basin. The water use accounts are based on top-down modelling, at a basin overview level of detail. They help develop understanding of the water uses in a river basin, and the limits to understanding that might result from sparse data.Starting with rainfall, the accounts track the partitioning of water into runoff, and evapotranspiration by dryland vegetation. The runoff is tracked as it becomes flow down the rivers, with losses (such as evaporation and seepage) and gains (such as tributary inflows), storages in lakes and reservoirs, diversion for irrigation or other purposes, floods in lowland floodplains and finally, in some rivers, discharges to the sea. The accounts estimate the water use by the major irrigation industries and other uses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7466881352758571860", "cites_id": ["7466881352758571860"], "pub_url": "https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/17497/17497.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VLMpcwexn2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 8, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
