This study was conducted to determine the impact of different agronomic practices on recharge control, in particular episodic recharge. During the period 1991\u20131995, two field experiments were carried out at Hillston (New South Wales) and Wallpeup (Victoria) where soil hydraulic properties, soil-moisture content, and leaf area index were measured. Various crop and pasture rotations were considered involving fallow, field pea (Piscum salivum L cv Dunndale), Indian mustard (Brassica juncca cv F2 cross), wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Janz Meering), oats (Avena sateva L. cv Coolabah), lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Arora) and medic pastures (Medicago truncatula cv Parriagio, Sephi and Hykon). Data obtained from these experiments were used to calibrate and test a biophysically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1226773512506044608", "cites_id": ["1226773512506044608"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377499000359", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wPDHiAJgBhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
