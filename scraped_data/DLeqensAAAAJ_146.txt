A generalized complementary relationship proposed by Brutsaert (2015); Brutsaert et al. (2020) has been shown to be a powerful tool for ET estimation. As the single parameter in the generalized complementary relationship, it is generally accepted that \u03b1c has high spatial variability and is closely correlated to the land-surface conditions. However, understanding of the temporal variability in \u03b1c is also important in a changing environment. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change and revegetation on ET by establishing the relationship between \u03b1c and the climatic-vegetation factors in 14 catchments of the Loess Plateau. The results showed that \u03b1c presented both spatial and temporal variability, where the aridity index (AI) and the average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the growing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11652430709382962310", "cites_id": ["11652430709382962310"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169420309768", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:htyfMv6_taEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 9}}
