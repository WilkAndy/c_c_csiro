A process\u2010based model considering climate and vegetation changes is employed to estimate ET. The simulated ET compared well with the observed values based on the flux measurements and water balance equation, with the coefficients of determination above 0.62. During the study period, environmental change of the study area was characterized by the increases in air temperature and leaf area index, that is, climate warming and vegetation greening. Annual ET increased at 104 catchments with the trends ranging from 0.01 to 6.2 mm yr\u22122. The numerical experiment approach and sensitivity method are used to attribute ET changes to climate variation and vegetation greening. The results show that the contributions of climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11631310322973924496", "cites_id": ["11631310322973924496"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JD032404", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kNwxCR23aqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 9}}
