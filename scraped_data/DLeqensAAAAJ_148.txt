The hydrology characteristics of ecosystems mainly influenced plant ecological processes in water and salinity changes. In this paper, we analyzed the composition and characteristic of natural plant community, divided the plant community classes and discussed the effect of water and salinity gradients on plant species and community classes in Ejina Desert Oasis. The results demonstrated that Populus euphratica, Tamarix chinensis and Phragmites communis were the most important plant species that had the highest important values among forest, shrubs and herbaceous. Six plant community patterns were classified by cluster analysis in Ejina Desert Oasis. Species richness and species diversity were the highest near West River and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5333684164592342916", "cites_id": ["5333684164592342916"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12665-015-4823-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hBenFn0NBUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
