The accuracy in simulating ET is affected by the calculation of underlying surface resistance. However, the surface resistance is difficult to be measured and greatly affected by climatic, crop and soil factors. How to quantify the combined effects of these factors on surface resistance is still a challenge for hydrologists. Our study attempted to construct and validate a semi-empirical surface resistance model based on the analysis of the response pattern of surface resistance to climatic resistance, leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture. The surface resistance was derived by the re-arranged Penman\u2013Monteith (PM) equation and the measured maize ET using eddy covariance in 2007. Results indicate that the ratio of surface resistance to climatic resistance showed a logarithmic relationship with LAI, and an exponential function as soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11397910667471932592", "cites_id": ["11397910667471932592"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169413001868", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sMxMBF2DLZ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
