The curve shape parameter \u03d6 in Fu's equation controls how much of the available water will be evaporated given the available energy. Previous studies have found that land surface characteristics significantly affect variations in the parameter \u03d6. In this study, we focus on the vegetation impact and examine the conditions under which vegetation plays a major role in controlling the variability of \u03d6. Using data from 26 major global river basins that are larger than 300,000 km2, the basin\u2010specific \u03d6 parameter is found to be linearly correlated with the long\u2010term averaged annual vegetation coverage. A simple parameterization for the \u03d6 parameter based solely on remotely sensed vegetation information is proposed, which improves predictions of annual actual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 322, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6136501887804611909", "cites_id": ["6136501887804611909"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wrcr.20107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RZ0bUvQ7KVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 13, "2015": 15, "2016": 20, "2017": 34, "2018": 25, "2019": 34, "2020": 40, "2021": 52, "2022": 59, "2023": 26}}
