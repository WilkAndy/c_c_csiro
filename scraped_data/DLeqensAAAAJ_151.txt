We used state-of-the-art satellite-based products to estimate spatial and temporal variations and trends in annual precipitation, evapotranspiration and total water storage change across eastern TP, which were then used to reconstruct an annual runoff variability series for 2003\u20132014. The basin-scale reconstructed streamflow variability matched well with gauge observations for five large rivers. Annual runoff increased strongly in dry part because of increases in precipitation, but decreased in wet part because of decreases in precipitation, aggravated by noticeable increases in evapotranspiration in the north of wet part. Although precipitation primarily governed temporal-spatial pattern of runoff \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10543674174444785800", "cites_id": ["10543674174444785800"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-017-15678-x.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iNA9g8ynUpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
