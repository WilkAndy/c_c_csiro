By analysing the flux measurements from 23 ecosystems in Australia, we found the the correlation between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) was significant for non-forest ecosystems, but was not for forests. In non-forest ecosystems, both GPP and Re increased with rainfall, and, consequently net ecosystem production (NEP) increased with rainfall. In forest ecosystems, GPP and Re were insensitive to rainfall. Furthermore sensitivity of GPP to rainfall was dominated by the rainfall-driven variation of LAI rather GPP per unit LAI in non-forest ecosystems, which was not correctly reproduced by current land models, indicating that the mechanisms underlying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10848979176696607582", "cites_id": ["10848979176696607582"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11063-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XnOcshRRj5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
