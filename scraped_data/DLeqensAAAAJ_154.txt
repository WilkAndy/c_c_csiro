This simple statement has important implications for managing dryland salinity and changes in river flows. Until recently the data analysis and predictive tools only permitted confidence in predictions concerning river flows on a mean annual basis. This has limited the use of the science in the day-to-day management of water resources and catchment planning. This report is part of a series that bridges the gap between the science of catchment water balances and the management of rivers for a range of outcomes by considering the impact of afforestation on flow distribution throughout the year. Afforestation and water will remain a contentious issue until the hydrologic impacts are clear for a complete range of environments and timescales.This work has been conducted by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Catchment Hydrology's program concerning land-use impacts on rivers. The program is focused upon the impact of man's activities upon the land and stream environment upon the physical attributes of rivers. We are concerned about managing impacts for catchments ranging in size from a single hillslope to several thousands of square kilometres. The specific impacts we are considering are changes in streamflow, changes to instream habitat by the movement of coarse sediment and changes to water quality (sediment, nutrients and salt).
