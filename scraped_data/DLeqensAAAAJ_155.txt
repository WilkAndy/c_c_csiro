However, the unclear relationship between hydrological effects and various LUCC characteristics and lack of observed continuous land cover data limit the accurate quantification of LUCC on global evapotranspiration (ET). Here, LUCC-induced ET changes were derived from continuously observed land cover maps during 1982\u20132016 using a Budyko type method (Zhang-curve), which suggests that woodland cover change is the key and most sensitive property of LUCC affecting water yield. A woodland reclassification scheme was proposed for applying the Zhang-curve. Separated global woodland coverage agreed well with observed data at the country level around the world. The Zhang-curve estimated global mean annual land ET as 540.8 mm\u00b7yr\u22121 (excluding Antarctica). We show that global \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2266290628712773644", "cites_id": ["2266290628712773644"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216942100278X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DLg4ylF7cx8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
