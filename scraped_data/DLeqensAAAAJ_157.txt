Studies of modelling combined with field experiments can provide essential information to investigate interactions between carbon and water cycles and climate. Here we present a first attempt to investigate the long-term climate controls on seasonal patterns and inter-annual variations in water and carbon exchanges in an arid-zone savanna-woodland ecosystem using a detailed mechanistic soil\u2013plant\u2013atmosphere model (SPA), driven by leaf area index (LAI) simulated by an ecohydrological model (WAVES) and observed climate data during 1981\u20132012. The SPA was tested against almost 3 years of eddy covariance flux measurements in terms of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). The model was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6619862445447681172", "cites_id": ["6619862445447681172"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-015-9956-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lJTbEtJ53lsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
