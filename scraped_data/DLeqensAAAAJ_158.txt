The Brutsaert-Nieber method was applied to estimate catchment-scale effective groundwater parameters; representative values were 4.5\u00d7 10^ sup-4^ m^ sup 2^ s^ sup-1^ for the hydraulic diffusivity; 3.19\u00d7 10^ sup-5^ m^ sup 2^ s^ sup-1/2^ for the hydraulic desorptivity; 2.27\u00d7 10^ sup-4^ m s^ sup-1^ for the hydraulic conductivity; and 0.2617 for the drainable porosity. The response constants correlate well with the total stream length and catchment area. Solutions of the linearised Boussinesq equation were used to guide the development of regional multivariate regression models for estimating low-flow indices from the catchment-scale effective parameters. Results showed that these catchments exhibit similar low-flow characteristics.
