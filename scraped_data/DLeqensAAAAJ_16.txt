The highly erodible Loess Plateau in the Yellow River Basin is the main source of high sediment loads resulting in poor water quality. Engineering and re-vegetation measures have been (and are being) widely implemented to reduce these environmental problems, but it has since been found that re-vegetation activities result in a decrease of streamflow. Given that water resources are currently over allocated in the Yellow River Basin (as seen by the river increasingly not reaching the sea), the external hydrological impacts from current and planned re-vegetation activities need to be taken into account by a wide range of natural resources managers and policy makers.
