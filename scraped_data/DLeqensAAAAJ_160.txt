In the densely populated Mekong Delta located at the mouth of the Mekong River basin in southern Vietnam, the hydrogeological systems have been transformed from an almost undisturbed to a human-impacted state and saltwater intrusion into surface water and groundwater systems has grown to be a detrimental issue recently, seriously threatening freshwater supply and degrading the eco-environment. In this article, the impacts of human activities and climate change (e.g., groundwater over-exploitation, relative sea-level rise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13782765047004278018", "cites_id": ["13782765047004278018"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674927821000708", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ai1cOck3Rr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
