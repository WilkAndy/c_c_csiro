By explicitly modelling climate processes within and across global climate model grid cells for a region, dynamical downscaling can provide higher-resolution hydroclimate projections and independent (from historical time series), physically plausible future rainfall time series for hydrological modelling applications. However, since rainfall is not typically constrained to observations by these methods, there is often a need for bias correction before use in hydrological modelling. Many bias-correction methods (such as scaling, empirical and distributional mapping) have been proposed in the literature, but methods that treat daily amounts only (and not sequencing) can result in residual biases in certain rainfall characteristics, which flow through to biases and problems with subsequently modelled runoff. We apply quantile\u2013quantile mapping to rainfall dynamically downscaled by the NSW and ACT Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) Project in the state of Victoria, Australia, and examine the effect of this on (i) biases both before and after bias correction in different rainfall metrics, (ii) change signals in metrics in comparison to the bias and (iii) the effect of bias correction on wet\u2013wet and dry\u2013dry transition probabilities. After bias correction, persistence of wet states is under-correlated (i.e. more random than observations), and this results in a significant bias (underestimation) of runoff using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5131986756525102815", "cites_id": ["5131986756525102815"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/24/2963/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3xawvsN6OEcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
