Generally, trees use more water than pastures and crops. In the Murray-Darling Basin there are plans to convert large areas of pastures to forestry plantations in the coming decades; a range of commercial and environmental considerations motivates these plans. This report describes the implementation of a simple water balance model in a GIS framework for assessing average annual streamflows (water yield) under different landuse scenarios. The model requires only catchment percentage forest cover and mean annual rainfall. This report describes the water balance model, its input data and the process required to prepare those data.To demonstrate the use of the model, a case study is presented. The study utilises average rainfall data for the period 1980 to 1995 and vegetation cover data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17512053156009877898", "cites_id": ["17512053156009877898"], "pub_url": "https://ewater.org.au/archive/crcch/archive/pubs/pdfs/technical200108.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iiG6A5BPB_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
