Three functional constraints are ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE), light-use efficiency (LUE), and the partitioning of precipitation P into evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff based on the Budyko framework. Although values of these three constraints varied significantly with time scale and should be quite conservative if being averaged over multiple decades, the results showed that both WUE and LUE simulated by the ensemble mean of 12 ESMs were generally lower than the site measurements. Simulations by the ESMs were generally consistent with the broad pattern of energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3299752302809542264", "cites_id": ["3299752302809542264"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/31/8/jcli-d-16-0177.1.xml?tab_body=pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eG69jzwTyy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
