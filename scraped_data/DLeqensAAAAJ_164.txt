In practice, there is often a trade\u2010off between simplicity and accuracy, especially when resources for catchment management are scarce. Here, we evaluated the performance of a monthly rainfall\u2013runoff model (dynamic water balance model, DWBM) for dry\u2010season flow prediction under climate and land\u2010use change. Using different methods with decreasing amounts of catchment information to set the four model parameters, we predicted dry\u2010season flow for 89 Australian catchments and verified model performance with an independent dataset of 641 catchments in the United States. For the Australian catchments, model performance without catchment information (other than climate forcing) was fair; it increased significantly as the information to infer the four model parameters increased.
