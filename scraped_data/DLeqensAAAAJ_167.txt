In this study, we investigated the challenges of vegetation greening resulted from forest restoration on water resource sustainability, using a model\u2010based simulation in northwestern China. Four different vegetation scenarios and 25 future climate scenarios were employed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. Results suggest that (a) the mean annual evapotranspiration changes from only 7.2% in the barren case to 100% in the forest case; however, it produced a 35.2% reduction in average annual streamflow and a 157% increase in soil water storage. The upstream vegetation greening caused the enhancement of water retention, while also creating great challenges for future downstream water resource sustainability; (b) seasonal effect was significant in that 100% forest case increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8282139330158889293", "cites_id": ["8282139330158889293"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.11118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TYlpEtcR8HIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
