The research must be underpinned by information on how much water there is in a basin, where it goes and how it is used. There should, furthermore, be an understanding of future constraints (such as the impact of climate change), opportunities (such as increased diversions for irrigation) and trade-offs (such as changed land use improving dryland productivity but leaving less water for downstream use).We describe a water use account for the Mekong that provides monthly estimates of major water uses. We have used it for historical estimates, but in principle it can also be used for prediction. Starting with rainfall, the account tracks the partitioning of water into runoff, and evapotranspiration by dryland vegetation. The runoff is tracked as it becomes flow down the rivers, with losses (such as evaporation and seepage) and gains (such as tributary inflows), storages in lakes and reservoirs, diversion for irrigation or other purposes, floods in lowland floodplains and finally discharges to the sea. The account estimates the water use by the major irrigation industries and other uses. The account helps develop understanding of the water uses in the Mekong Basin, and the likely consequences of large changes, such as climate change, land use change, increased diversions and irrigation water use, and changed storages."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14292314853386384614", "cites_id": ["14292314853386384614"], "pub_url": "https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/17498/17498.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5nQinqKAWMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
