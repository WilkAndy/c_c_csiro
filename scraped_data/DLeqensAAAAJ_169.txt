This means that the impacts of afforestation on water security, salinity, and environmental flows need to be considered in catchment management planning. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the relationship between vegetation and streamflow at the mean annual time scale. Unfortunately, our understanding of the impact of forest cover change on streamflow at shorter timescale is limited. One way to evaluate the effect of afforestation on a streamflow time series is to examine changes in a catchment\u2019s flow duration curve (FDC) following a change in forest cover. A FDC represents the relationships between the magnitude and frequency of streamflow for a catchment and provides an estimate of the percentage of time a given flow is equalled or exceeded.
