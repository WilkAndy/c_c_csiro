Understanding temporal and spatial variations in the depth to groundwater in the region is important for developing management strategies. Depth to groundwater records for 48 observation wells in the Minqin oasis were available for 22 years from 1981 to 2003, allowing us to compare three different interpolation methods based on three selected years (1981, 1990, 2002) as starting points. The three methods were inverse distance weighting (IDW), radial basis function (RBF), and kriging (including ordinary kriging (OK), simple kriging (SK), and universal kriging (UK)). Cross-validation was applied to evaluate the accuracy of the various methods, and two indices \u2013 the correlation coefficient (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) \u2013 were used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 280, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8769896113730868560", "cites_id": ["8769896113730868560"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815209000796", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UNUB8AzutHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 11, "2012": 11, "2013": 26, "2014": 20, "2015": 18, "2016": 27, "2017": 30, "2018": 24, "2019": 33, "2020": 23, "2021": 26, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
