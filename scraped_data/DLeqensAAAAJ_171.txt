Available at: http://wwwmaths. anu. edu. au/research. reports/mrr/02/003", "abstract": "This paper describes an attempt to identify catchments within Australia that have similar stream flow signatures. The stream flow from a catchment represents the integrated effect of the catchment's physical characteristics, such as topography, soil and vegetation to external impacts such as climate. Therefore, stream flow represents the response of a catchment to these variables and has been called the signature of the catchment in this paper."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17789649344370571087", "cites_id": ["17789649344370571087"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/48130630/Zoppou-etal-2002_Regionalization_of_daily_stream_flow_in_Australia_using_wavelets_and_k-means_analysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T_f3OdOH4fYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
