In this study, the dynamics and variability of soil moisture at small hillslope transects were analyzed by artificial rainfall simulation experiments in which the influence of crop type and slope angle were considered. Soil moisture variability and dynamics during the rainfall-runoff process were monitored by capacitance sensors (EC-5) with high temporal resolution (1 min) and continuously measured after rainfall ceased to investigate soil moisture dynamics and patterns by the method of data visualization. Relationships between soil moisture and runoff (surface and subsurface flow) and response lag times of soil moisture at different slope positions and soil layers were investigated. The dynamics of soil moisture during the entire crop growth stage were also analyzed. Results showed that soil moisture exerted strong influence on runoff generation, but the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10284639247574367177", "cites_id": ["10284639247574367177"], "pub_url": "https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yfu1wudguo4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
