This study aims to provide recharge estimates for the modelling of the Tertiary/Quaternary alluvial groundwater system, believed to be the origin of the surface salinisation problem in the Liverpool Plains. In particular, it aims to indicate the relativity of different sources of recharge, namely localised recharge derived from runoffinterflow from the Ranges and hillslopes, and diffuse recharge on the low lying alluvial flats. The salinity control options depend on which recharge component is predominant. This report details the methodology used to get recharge estimates for the groundwater modelling.The runoff and interflow is estimated, using a relationship between rainfall and evapotranspiration developed by Holmes and Sinclair in 1986. This relationship relies on field data at a catchment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11105447415229129650", "cites_id": ["11105447415229129650"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Glen-Walker-2/publication/255597108_Recharge_Estimation_in_the_Liverpool_Plains_NSW_for_input_Groundwater_Models/links/00b7d53447a6de8285000000/Recharge-Estimation-in-the-Liverpool-Plains-NSW-for-input-Groundwater-Models.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:siODwJV5HpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3}}
