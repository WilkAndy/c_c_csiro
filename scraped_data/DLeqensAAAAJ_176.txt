Previous studies have recognized that spatial variability of mean annual baseflow coefficient (BFC = , ratio of baseflow to precipitation) is primarily controlled by aridity index and storage capacity. However, an analytical solution of BFC in terms of the dominant controlling factors has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to develop an analytical BFC curve to depict spatial variability of BFC based on the \u201climit\u201d concept of the Budyko framework. The BFC curve relates the baseflow coefficient to aridity index and storage capacity without resolving complex interactions between evapotranspiration and baseflow generation. The proposed BFC curve showed that, in the arid catchments, baseflow coefficient was primarily limited by available water (precipitation, P) and, in the humid catchments, was jointly controlled by both the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10406913321094879286", "cites_id": ["10406913321094879286"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020WR029529", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NhgkAIfIbJAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
