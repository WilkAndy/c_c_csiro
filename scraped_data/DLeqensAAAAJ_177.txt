Instead of using laboratory measurements of soil properties, these authors have collected actual measurements of soil moisture from a wide range of field studies around Australia. In total, extractable soil water capacity is presented for 180 locations that include the six States and two Territories. They have also compared estimates of extractable soil moisture from field measurements with those from the Atlas of Australian Soils.The'active'soil store-the amount of water than can be evaporated from soils or used by plants-is a key parameter in hydrologic models. The work presented here is an important contribution to the catchment modelling effort that is core business of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Catchment Hydrology. I commend this report to anyone interested in the interaction between water and Australian soils."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12274532548654558618,480032611887231541", "cites_id": ["12274532548654558618", "480032611887231541"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tony-Ladson/publication/228387671_Estimating_extractable_soil_moisture_content_for_Australian_soils/links/00b7d52b83818273cf000000/Estimating-extractable-soil-moisture-content-for-Australian-soils.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mm2G2lHmV6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
