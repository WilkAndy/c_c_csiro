The issues covered include developing sustainable land use practices, estimating time scales for salinization to occur or recede, impacts of proposed land uses on catchment behaviour, and ensuring that remediation activities aimed at modifying the hydrological behaviour of a catchment are targeted at the appropriate parts of the catchment. The series includes: physical and chemical techniques for discharge studies; groundwater chemical methods for recharge studies; soil physical methods for estimating recharge; catchment scale recharge modelling; using groundwater responses to infer recharge and soil water tracers to estimate recharge; groundwater processes and modelling; electromagnetic induction techniques; surface water balance for recharge estimation; and plot scale models and their application to recharge studies. Documentation of techniques, clear worked examples, and some explanation of the appropriateness of various techniques are also included."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8094002939811629880,13263270468024233111", "cites_id": ["8094002939811629880", "13263270468024233111"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043032484", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OItwNsqsU3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
