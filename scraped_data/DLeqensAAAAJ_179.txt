A key part of the guidance is expected to be a quantitative estimate of climate and runoff change into the future.The Victorian Climate Initiative (VicCI) is a three-year regional climate initiative launched in May 2013 by the Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI)\u2013now the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (DELWP)\u2013and the research partners Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO. This report presents projected changes in climate and runoff at 2040 and 2065 for Victoria relative to 1975\u20132014. These projections use empirical scaling of outputs from global climate models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10119262185308620463", "cites_id": ["10119262185308620463"], "pub_url": "http://www.bom.gov.au/research/projects/vicci/docs/2016/PotterEtAl2016.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rwZd6FfXbowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
