Understanding the impacts of climate and land\u2010use changes on streamflow can facilitate development of sustainable water resources strategies. This study investigates the flow variation of the Zamu River, an inland river in the arid area of northwest China, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool distributed hydrological model. Three different land\u2010use and climate\u2010change scenarios were considered on the basis of measured climate data and land\u2010use cover, and then these data were input into the hydrological model. Based on the sensitivity analysis, model calibration and verification, the hydrological response to different land\u2010use and climate\u2010change scenarios was simulated. The results indicate that the runoff varied with different land\u2010use type, and the runoff of the mountain reaches of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 263, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13829006417193093285", "cites_id": ["13829006417193093285"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6846", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pUhkNRGA6r8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 7, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 27, "2014": 18, "2015": 23, "2016": 30, "2017": 24, "2018": 24, "2019": 11, "2020": 20, "2021": 21, "2022": 16, "2023": 6}}
