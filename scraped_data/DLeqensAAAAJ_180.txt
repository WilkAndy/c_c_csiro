It explores both field methods and modelling methods for measuring or estimating the different parts of the water balance, including rainfall, evaporation, run-off and soil water storage. The authors discuss the concepts required to understand a surface water balance result or to set up an experiment. As water balance studies can be both time-consuming and expensive, this report will give readers a better understanding of water balance approaches and the considerations before going into a water balance study for the purpose of deep drainage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8094002939811629880", "cites_id": ["8094002939811629880"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=kpOL3o4tT5cC&oi=fnd&pg=PT6&dq=info:OItwNsqsU3AJ:scholar.google.com&ots=LI0xh7cqaR&sig=FOkUNikH96jX3Uyhf5U-fS7hjos", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OItwNsqsU3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
