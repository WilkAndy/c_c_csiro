Many fundamentally different techniques can be used, each with different capabilities of resolving or representing sub-gridscale processes. The different formulations can lead to variations in the downscaled output with consequential impacts in the interpretation of future change. Here, future runoff is estimated for six catchments in the Australian state of Victoria using five different regional rainfall projection products. We investigate how differences in rainfall input manifest in a selection of regionally important hydroclimate metrics. Overall, annual runoff is projected to decline under most methods, but seasonal changes are more uncertain reflecting differences in the rainfall change signal for different downscaled products. Whilst change in flow metrics are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8972989672896636023", "cites_id": ["8972989672896636023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169418304402", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d6RACpF2hnwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
