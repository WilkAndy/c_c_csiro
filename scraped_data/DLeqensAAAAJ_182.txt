Previously published results indicate that the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to rainfall at the interannual timescale generally increases as catchment aridity increases. This paper generalizes these results to the interstorm timescale by calculating the variance of interstorm evapotranspiration from a stochastic model of soil moisture balance. The derived analytical solution is compared to expressions for the variability of antecedent and poststorm soil moisture. This analysis shows that variability of interstorm evapotranspiration is low when average storm depth or average interstorm potential evapotranspiration is small relative to soil moisture capacity, as evapotranspiration is limited by the available water and energy. When water and energy inputs are larger, interstorm evapotranspiration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9201671417592542410", "cites_id": ["9201671417592542410"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006WR005276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yvR32Wbnsn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
