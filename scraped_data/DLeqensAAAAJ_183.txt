The measurements were taken at six sites along a 100 km rainfall gradient. Two types of simulations were conducted: (1) offline simulations forced with measured atmospheric input data at each of the six sites, and (2) regional simulations with the two land surface schemes coupled to the regional climate model DARLAM.The two land surface schemes employ two different canopy modelling concepts: in SCAM the vegetation is conceptually above the ground surface, while CSIRO9 employs the more commonly used `horizontally tiled' approach in which the vegetation cover is modelled by conceptually placing it beside bare ground. Both schemes utilize the same below-ground components (soil hydrological and thermal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18014260040867438952", "cites_id": ["18014260040867438952"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021544607688", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aOFqQxCC__kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1}}
