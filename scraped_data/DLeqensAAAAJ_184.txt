Various methods have been developed to improve the performances of the three flow components by focusing on calibration procedures. However, the understanding of runoff partitioning structure in MWBMs for better performances is still very limited, especially whether the storage-discharge relationship is linear or nonlinear at monthly time scale. In this study, model structures for baseflow simulation in 5 widely used MWBMs are reviewed and modified from a linear storage-discharge relationship to a nonlinear exponential storage-discharge relationship to achieve realistic baseflow simulation in 443 catchments from Australia with diverse hydro-climatic conditions. The performances of original and modified models are evaluated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=225163231387813657", "cites_id": ["225163231387813657"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169420310325", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GYdZF8TwHwMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
