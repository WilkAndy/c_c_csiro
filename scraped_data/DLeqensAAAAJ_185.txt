However, how to accurately separate and estimate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on ET variation remains uncertain. Our study attempted to interpret the interannual variation in ET during 2007\u20132013 over a maize field in northwest China, using four methods simultaneously, such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) model, the modified crop coefficient method, the Priestly-Taylor (PT) model and the regression linear model.Results indicate that compared to the ET in 2007, the ET decreased averagely by 12, 30, 29, and 73\u202fW\u202fm\u22122 in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. All models yielded similar results and showed that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating ET relative to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18323757297624711064", "cites_id": ["18323757297624711064"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169418304566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mH9kwy0QS_4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
