However, the sediment generation processes are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty, which give rise to extreme complexity for SSY change assessment in Newtonian approach. Consequently, few approaches can be simply but widely applied to decompose impacts of climatic variability and human activities on SSY change. Thus, it is an urgent need to develop advanced methods that are simple and robust. Since that the Newtonian approach is hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms, there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in Darwinian approach for hydrological change prediction or explanation. As streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment, SSY change are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17958370508126398980", "cites_id": ["17958370508126398980"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169418301665", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BKq5YdTyOPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
