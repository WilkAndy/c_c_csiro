This study presents a predictive method for determining afforestation impacts on streamflow using data from four Australian experimental catchments with considerable forest cover change. Monthly values of rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow are available for these catchments, as well as other data including plant available water capacity, minimum and maximum elevations, and index of valley bottom flatness. The proposed method is based on a dynamic water balance model (DWBM) with parameter values estimated from climate and catchment characteristics using projection pursuit regression (PPR). To predict the impacts of afforestation on monthly streamflow, the DWBM model was calibrated for pretreatment conditions and afforestation\u2010induced changes in the model parameters were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9831839507316197595", "cites_id": ["9831839507316197595"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.1821", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:28g7yvC1cYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
