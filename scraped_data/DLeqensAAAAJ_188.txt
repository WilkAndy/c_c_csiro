To minimize soil erosion and land degradation, China has implemented several ecological engineering such as \u201cGrain for Green\u201d program (GFG) since 1999. Relationship between vegetation and water budgets in catchments has been widely studied, however very few studies addressed the effects of eco-environmental restoration on water balance in mountain areas, especially with a focus on soil moisture content. Therefore SWAT model was used to quantify the effects of ecological engineering actions (taken place in 2005) on water balance in Qilian Mountain.After the ecological engineering, water yield and soil water content experienced an increment of 32%, and 46%. The opposite trend was monitored in runoff and evapotranspiration, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1706024463200031271", "cites_id": ["1706024463200031271"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581815001305", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JxIq2zUErRcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
