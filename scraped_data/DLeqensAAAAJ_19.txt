Taken a vineyard at the Shiyang river basin of the Hexi corridor of Gansu Province as an example, this study evaluated the applicability of the Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) method in the arid desert region of northwest China, simulated the variation of vineyard ET by Penman\u2013Monteith (P\u2013M), Shuttle\u2013Wallace (S\u2013W) and Clumping (C) models in this region and compared the estimated ET by the three models with the measured ET by the BREB. Results indicated that the BREB could provide the accurate measurement of vineyard ET from the arid desert region when the Bowen ratio instrument with higher accuracy was correctly installed. Generally, the variation of the estimated ET from P\u2013M, S\u2013W and C models were similar to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 240, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1342141995308751334", "cites_id": ["1342141995308751334"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192308001561", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5hmDpAg_oBIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 16, "2014": 15, "2015": 22, "2016": 18, "2017": 22, "2018": 20, "2019": 28, "2020": 16, "2021": 19, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
