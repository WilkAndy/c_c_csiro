A feature of some recent implementations of this approach is the need for the estimation of a free parameter, usually by calibration. In a different class of representations of landscape evaporation, several functional forms have been proposed in the past for the dependency of the mean annual evaporation precipitation ratio (E/P) on the mean annual aridity index \u2014the Schreiber\u2010Oldekop hypothesis, also known as the Budyko framework. While there is no general agreement in the literature on the optimal formulation of the \u201cmaximum possible evaporation\u201d  the functional forms of  appear to be quite insensitive to its exact nature. This observation allows  to be equated with the atmospheric evaporative demand  and this immediately leads to a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1391752226817205330", "cites_id": ["1391752226817205330"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021wr029729", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UmTMxkZ_UBMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
