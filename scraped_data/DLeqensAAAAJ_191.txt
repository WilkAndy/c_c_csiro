This study chose the Campaspe catchment in southeastern Australia as a field example and examined the uncertainty of spatial groundwater recharge by performing uncertainty analysis. The study area was first divided into 13 zones according to different vegetation types, soil groups and precipitation. Individual models were then established for these zones using the biophysically based modelling code WAVES (Water Atmosphere Vegetation Energy and Solutes), which is capable of simulating unsaturated flow. The Monte Carlo method, together with the Latin-Hypercube sampling technique, was employed to perform uncertainty analysis by comparing modelled monthly evapotranspiration (ET) to MODIS ET.
