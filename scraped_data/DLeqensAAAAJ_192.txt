The changes of temporal variability can be characterized by more extreme climate, such as more frequent and intensive heavy precipitation, less light rain days, and longer dry spells. These changes can subsequently bring about more frequent and intensive hydrologic extremes, including floods and droughts. This study shows that increase in inter\u2010daily variability of precipitation and temperature not only triggers more intensive hydrologic extremes, but also causes considerable impacts on long\u2010term water availability. Sixteen climate scenarios are designed to separate overall changes of precipitation and temperature into two aspects: (1) change in monthly mean and (2) change in inter\u2010daily variability.
