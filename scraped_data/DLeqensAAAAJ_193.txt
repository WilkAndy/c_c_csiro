How to quantify riverbed infiltration to groundwater systems is an important area of research in hydrology. In this study, saturated permeability coefficient of a riverbed in an arid inland river basin located in the northwest of China was obtained by Guelph Permeameter and laboratory analysis methods. The characteristics of riverbed infiltration and its spatial patterns were analysed using geostatistical method and kriging method. The results showed that the saturated permeability coefficient varied from 0.089 to 2.802\u2009m/d, indicating moderate degree of variability. The Guelph Permeameter and laboratory test methods provided consistent estimates of saturated permeability coefficient. There was a strong spatial correlation for Kfs of the riverbed in this study area when Range (A) was less than 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7673916076576788212", "cites_id": ["7673916076576788212"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.10544", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9M6EdAM6f2oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
