Importance of the changes in functional attributes of vegetation associated with eCO2 for predicting responses of LAI has rarely been addressed. In this study, the WAter Vegetation Energy and Solute (WAVES) model was applied to simulate ecohydrological effects of the eCO2 at two free\u2010air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experimental sites with contrasting vegetation. One was carried out by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on the forest (ORNL FACE). The other one was conducted by the University of Minnesota on the grass (BioCON FACE). Results demonstrated that changes in functional attributes of vegetation (including reduction in specific leaf area, changes in carbon assimilation and allocation characteristics) and availability of nutrients are important for reproducing the responses of LAI \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17597930282736220894", "cites_id": ["17597930282736220894"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eco.1478", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3vqUtFpoOPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
