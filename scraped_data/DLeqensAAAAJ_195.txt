According to the latest National Plantation Inventory, the plantation area, nationwide, has increased over 70% since 1994 and reached a total area of 1,972,535 hectares in 2008 (BRS 2009). Tree planting for environmental purposes such carbon sequestration is likely to gain some support. It is anticipated that this could result in a significant expansion of plantation areas within the 600 to 1000 mm rainfall zones (O\u2019Grady et al., 2010). While bringing many commercial and environmental benefits, it is well established that conversion of agricultural lands to plantations has the potential to reduce water yields and impact on the water security of downstream users or the environment (Zhang et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2007).The National Water Initiative (NWI) has identified that the large-scale expansion of plantations has the potential to intercept large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4428477201150247660", "cites_id": ["4428477201150247660"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP104972&dsid=DS10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7AJ6Jo0cdT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
