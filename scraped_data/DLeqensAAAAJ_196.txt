As a result, an increasing salinity trend provides an early warning sign of impending dryland salinity and gives an indication of the general health of a catchment. In 1987, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission\u2019s Salinity and Drainage Strategy established a key basin-wide strategy to control salinity, which uses the stream salinity at Morgan (South Australia) as a key indicator of the management of stream salinisation in the Basin. The Strategy highlights the impacts of irrigation areas, with an assumption of nominal input from dryland areas. Recent studies have suggested that the effect of dryland salinity on stream salinisation will be much greater than was originally estimated for the Strategy. This Basinwide assessment of stream salinisation proposes to determine the magnitude of the dryland areas on stream salinisation and the areas where targeted funding for remediation should be focused. Statistical trends and catchment salt and water balances were used to reconstruct the history of stream salinisation across the Murray-Darling Basin. Establishment of historical stream salinity trends and catchment salt balances was seen as a necessary pre-condition for the development of approaches to predict likely future trends. Analysis of these trends highlight a distinct region of stream salinity and catchment salinisation \u2018hot-spots\u2019 within the Basin. These hot-spots are of high priority for detailed investigation and their identification will assist in targeting future remedial work.For many areas of the Basin, the stream salinity data set was generally quite limited, with few locations of long \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8275206470533997604", "cites_id": ["8275206470533997604"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46721288/tr33-98.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JGQx53Bw13IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
