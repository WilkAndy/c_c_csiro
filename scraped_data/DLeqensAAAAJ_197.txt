The Budyko framework considers aridity index as the dominant control on hydrological partitioning, while the parameter represents integrated influences of catchment properties. Our understanding regarding the controls of catchment properties on the parameter is still limited. In this study, two machine learning methods, that is, boosted regression tree (BRT) and CUBIST, were used to model \u03c9. Interpretable machine learning methods were adopted for better physical understanding including feature importance, accumulated local effects (ALE), and local interpretable model\u2010agnostic explanations. Among the 15 properties of 443 Australian catchments, analysis of feature importance showed that root zone storage capacity (SR), vapor pressure, vegetation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15629112611639150599", "cites_id": ["15629112611639150599"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021WR031412", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B0hUGx3D5dgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
