Soil moisture and meteorological data during the period of 1998 to 2003 were obtained from an irrigated cropland ecosystem with winter wheat and maize in the North China Plain to test the probabilistic soil moisture dynamic model. Results showed that the model was able to capture the soil moisture dynamics and estimate long-term water balance reasonably well when little soil water deficit existed. The prediction of mean plant water stress during winter wheat and maize growing season quantified the suitability of the wheat\u2013maize rotation to the soil and climate environmental conditions in North China Plain under the impact of irrigation. Under the impact of precipitation fluctuations, there is no significant bimodality of the average soil moisture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4261935453463387628", "cites_id": ["4261935453463387628"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02626667.2010.544256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7B1U17ZvJTsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
