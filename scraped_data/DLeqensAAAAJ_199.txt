Often, the active soil moisture store is estimated from laboratory measurements of soil properties. An alternative approach, described in this paper, is to estimate the extractable soil moisture capacity from direct measurements of soil moisture content in the field. A time series of soil moisture values, over the depth of the soil, shows the actual changes in water content. The difference between the wettest and driest profiles is an estimate of the extractable soil moisture storage. We have gathered data on extractable soil water capacity for 180 locations over Australia and have compared our values with published results from the Atlas of Australian Soils (AAS), derived from profile descriptions and pedo-transfer functions. Our results show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17142713396440651193", "cites_id": ["17142713396440651193"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr04180", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:udUsEQIn5-0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
