This review focuses on the use of paired catchment studies for determining the changes in water yield at various time scales resulting from permanent changes in vegetation. The review considers long term annual changes, adjustment time scales, the seasonal pattern of flows and changes in both annual and seasonal flow duration curves. The paired catchment studies reported in the literature have been divided into four broad categories: afforestation experiments, deforestation experiments, regrowth experiments and forest conversion experiments. Comparisons between paired catchment results and a mean annual water balance model are presented and show good agreement between the two methodologies. The results highlight the potential underestimation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1696, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3994160268629143948", "cites_id": ["3994160268629143948"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169404005906", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jHGeM5obbjcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 18, "2007": 42, "2008": 36, "2009": 57, "2010": 71, "2011": 98, "2012": 87, "2013": 94, "2014": 82, "2015": 109, "2016": 139, "2017": 125, "2018": 151, "2019": 129, "2020": 117, "2021": 126, "2022": 149, "2023": 38}}
