The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the seasonal distributions of water and energy, and their interactions with the soil moisture store, on mean annual water balance in Australia at catchment scales using a stochastic model of soil moisture balance with seasonally varying forcing. The rainfall regime at 262 catchments around Australia was modeled as a Poisson process with the mean storm arrival rate and the mean storm depth varying throughout the year as cosine curves with annual periods. The soil moisture dynamics were represented by use of a single, finite water store having infinite infiltration capacity, and the potential evapotranspiration rate was modeled as an annual cosine curve. The mean annual water budget was calculated numerically using a Monte Carlo simulation. The model predicted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 232, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=302896162578837862", "cites_id": ["302896162578837862"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004WR003697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZjFXfnQaNAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 10, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 12, "2012": 16, "2013": 8, "2014": 17, "2015": 14, "2016": 13, "2017": 19, "2018": 15, "2019": 15, "2020": 24, "2021": 19, "2022": 24, "2023": 4}}
