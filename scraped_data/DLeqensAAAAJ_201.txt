Rainfall and streamflow data from 65 catchments in southeast Australia are used to quantify the rainfall-streamflow relationship prior to, during, and after, the 1997\u20132009 Millennium Drought. The results showed that: (1) the annual streamflow is strongly correlated to the annual rainfall, however the relationship is different in the different hydroclimate periods; (2) the number of rainfall days and the mean length of wet-spell (MeWS) are the two most \u201cstable variables\u201d that can best predict annual streamflow in the different hydroclimate periods, followed by the maximum and 99th percentile of 90-day accumulated total rainfall (D90Max and D90P99); (3) the combination of MeWS with several other rainfall characteristics can explain the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9451955466267435915", "cites_id": ["9451955466267435915"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421010672", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i6Ou_2oXLIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
