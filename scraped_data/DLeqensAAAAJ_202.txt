Dryland cropping occurs on around 5%(0.38 m km2) of Australia, most of which is rainfed but up to tenth of this may be irrigated in some or all years. The consultation reported here was undertaken in the wings of the Australian Rangelands Society 2019 Conference, so there were few participants representing the dryland cropping issues. In fact, Australia also has a long history of innovation in this context, from early \u2018stump-jump ploughs\u2019, to recent crop and pasture management (eg low and no-till approaches), water use and governance and dryland crop cultivar development, as well as management of emergent environmental issues such as dryland salinity. Dryland cropping continues to face new challenges such as those arising directly and indirectly from climate change.The Australian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9189170743064622082", "cites_id": ["9189170743064622082"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11368-020-02599-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AnTHwBp-hn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
