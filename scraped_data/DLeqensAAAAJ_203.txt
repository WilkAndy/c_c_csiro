It has been used to estimate temporal soil moisture dynamics and ecohydrological responses at a point. This study combines a nonlinear rainfall\u2013runoff theory with probabilistic water balance model to represent varied source area runoff as a function of rainfall depth and a runoff coefficient at hillslope scale. Analytical solutions of the soil\u2010moisture probability density function and average water balance model are then developed. Based on a sensitivity analysis of soil moisture dynamics, we show that when varied source area runoff is incorporated, mean soil moisture is always lower and total runoff higher, compared with the original probabilistic water balance model. The increased runoff from the inclusion of varied source area runoff is mainly because of a reduction in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5129789255935729539", "cites_id": ["5129789255935729539"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.9281", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gx-qRCasMEcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
