As an effort to that, here we develop a conceptual water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis (denoted PWBM) and for the first time, test the proportionality hypothesis using hydrologic observations across global catchments at varying time scales. The PWBM has a transparent and parsimonious model structure with only two model parameters, and requires precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index as model inputs. To test PWBM, we apply the model to simulate streamflow (Q), evapotranspiration (E) and storage change (\u0394S) in 22 large basins and 255 small basins globally and find an overall good model performance in reproducing all three water balance components at the daily (only in small basins \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1229023522550638955", "cites_id": ["1229023522550638955"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169419311813", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a-k60mFeDhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
