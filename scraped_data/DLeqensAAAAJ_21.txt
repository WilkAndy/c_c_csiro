Here we develop a universal model to predict water\u2010energy partitioning (\u03d6 parameter for the Fu's equation, one form of the Budyko framework) which spans small to large scale basins globally. A neural network (NN) model was developed using a data set of 224 small U.S. basins (100\u201310,000 km2) and 32 large, global basins (~230,000\u2013600,000 km2) independently and combined based on both local (slope, normalized difference vegetation index) and global (geolocation) factors. The Budyko framework with NN estimated \u03d6 reproduced observed mean annual ET well for the combined 256 basins. The predicted mean annual ET for ~36,600 global basins is in good agreement (R2\u2009=\u20090.72) with an independent global satellite\u2010based ET product, inversely validating the NN model.
