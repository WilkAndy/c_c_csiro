Impacts of land conversion (i.e., land conversion from cropland to grassland and forest) and climate change during near-future 2030s (2021\u20132040), mid-future 2050s (2041\u20132060), and far-future 2080s (2071\u20132090) periods on vegetation dynamics (LAI) and water budgets (evapotranspiration and runoff) were investigated in a typical over-utilized water resources area of China (Xiong\u2019an New Area, XNA) using the WAVES ecohydrological model. Future climate change impacts were assessed with statistically downscaled forcing of 18 global circulation models (GCMs) under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) using secondary bias-correction technique. Projected future climate indicated that XNA would become warmer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5262690358213229128", "cites_id": ["5262690358213229128"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421006107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SDosdP_UCEkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
