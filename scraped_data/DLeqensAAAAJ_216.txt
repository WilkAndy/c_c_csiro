Each individual crop transpiration directly related with agricultural production. Soil evaporation under transparent plastic mulch is decreased but can not be ignored especially under the condition with higher soil moisture and large film mulching fraction (f m). Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (\u03bbET) and its components (transpiration, \u03bbT rc and its sub-components (individual plant transpiration, \u03bbT rci); soil evaporation, \u03bbE s and its sub-components (bare soil evaporation, \u03bbE sbs; and mulched soil evaporation, \u03bbE sms)) for partial mulched interplanted croplands is essential for water resources management. In this study, a multiple source evapotranspiration model (SWIM) was proposed to accurately estimate \u03bbET and its components in partially mulched interplanted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10159708138561614490", "cites_id": ["10159708138561614490"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837742200587X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mjKcPLmI_owJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 7}}
