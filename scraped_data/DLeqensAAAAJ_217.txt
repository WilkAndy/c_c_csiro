However, the influence of glaciers on catchment characteristics within the framework has yet been adequately investigated. Here we extend the Budyko framework and apply the elasticity method to examine the effects of glaciers on runoff between 2001 and 2010 in 25 upstream catchments of the Tarim River Basin in western China. The consideration of glacier mass balance and glacier fraction improves the performance of the Budyko framework, especially for the catchments with a high glacier fraction. We found that the catchment characteristic parameter \u03c9 was strongly affected by glacier fraction, and it changes from 1.15 to 2.09 when glacier fraction decreases from 0.4191 to 0.0005. This also reflects the change in water\u2013energy partitioning that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11961792747147115957", "cites_id": ["11961792747147115957"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674927821001568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tT2MkiDTAKYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
