Crop models can provide constructive suggestions for scientific soil water-salt regulations. In the study an ecohydrological crop model WAVES (the WAter Vegetation Energy and Solute model) was employed to examine the crop responses to soil water-salt dynamics in a severely dry and saline region of southern Xinjiang, China. Observation data of film-mulched cotton with the initial soil salinity of 7.19\u20139.80 g kg-1 (EC1:5 of 1.56\u20132.12 dS m-1) were collected in 2009 and 2010 with five different irrigation water salinity treatments 0\u201311.05 g L-1 (EC of 0\u201311.85 dS m-1). Results showed that the relative absolute errors of simulated soil water and salt were less than 4.1% and 12.4% in 2010 (calibration), and 11.1% and 13.2% in 2009 (validation). The coefficient of determination of yield in calibration and validation was 0.93 and 0.74 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1766180632055828214", "cites_id": ["1766180632055828214"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377421003656", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9s7cXu27ghgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
