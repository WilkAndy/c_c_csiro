It is important to assess the impact of these practices on hydrology at the catchment scale. The Jialuhe River catchment, a tributary of the Yellow River, with a drainage area of 1117 km2 in the Loess Plateau, was chosen to investigate the hydrological responses to conservation practices. Parametric and non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Kendall tests were utilized to detect trends in hydrological variables or their residuals. Relationships between precipitation and hydrological variables were developed to remove the impact of precipitation variability. Significant linear decreasing trends in annual surface runoff and baseflow were identified during the treated period from 1967 to 1989, and the rate of reduction was 1\u00b730 and 0\u00b748 mm/year, respectively. As result, mean annual surface runoff and baseflow decreased by 32 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17466763061848246122", "cites_id": ["17466763061848246122"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.1454", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:agdhPXZoZvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 12, "2008": 13, "2009": 15, "2010": 15, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 12, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 11, "2018": 15, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
