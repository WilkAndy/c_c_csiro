Our study attempted to accurately quantify the environmental and physiological control on variability in evaporative fraction (EF) based on the Penman\u2013Monteith model. The eddy covariance method was used to measure water flux over a canopy and then calculate the EF above a maize field in northwest China in 2007. Results indicate that the EF was lower in other growth stages than in the heading stage, so the EF value in the heading stage was taken as the standard value. The decreases in EF caused by canopy conductance and environmental factors were 0.176 and \u22120.026, accounting for 117% and \u221217% of the total difference in EF, respectively. Such results were mainly due to the following: (1) the variation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9056378691952497100", "cites_id": ["9056378691952497100"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.9413", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zNE-BXC4rn0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
