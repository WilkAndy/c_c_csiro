The effect of atmospheric stability on the energy-balance method and the Penman-Monteith equation is examined using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The energy-balance method calculates actual evapotranspiration as a residual from the energy-balance equation, with the sensible heat flux estimated using the aerodynamic resistance. The Penman-Monteith equation calculates actual evapotranspiration using the canopy resistance and the aerodynamic resistance. The two equations are sensitive to the aerodynamic resistance when the surface is rough. For unstable conditions, the Penman-Monteith equation is relatively insensitive, while the energy-balance method is sensitive to the aerodynamic resistance. Under stable conditions, the Penman-Monteith equation is more sensitive to the aerodynamic resistance than the energy-balance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5923125411299484624", "cites_id": ["5923125411299484624"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5923125411299484624&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0GOY9C0rM1IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
