Research to date has successfully characterised where and when shifts occurred and explored relationships with potential drivers, but a convincing physical explanation for observed changes in catchment behaviour is still lacking. Originating from a large multi-disciplinary workshop, this paper presents and evaluates a range of hypothesised process explanations of flow response to the Millennium Drought. The hypotheses consider climatic forcing, vegetation, soil moisture dynamics, groundwater, and anthropogenic influence. The hypotheses are assessed against evidence both temporally (e.g. why was the Millennium Drought different to previous droughts?) and spatially (e.g. why did rainfall\u2013runoff relationships shift in some catchments but not in others?). Thus, the strength of this work is a large-scale assessment of hydrologic changes and potential drivers. Of 24 hypotheses, 3 are considered plausible, 10 are considered inconsistent with evidence, and 11 are in a category in between, whereby they are plausible yet with reservations (e.g. applicable in some catchments but not others). The results point to the unprecedented length of the drought as the primary climatic driver, paired with interrelated groundwater processes, including declines in groundwater storage, altered recharge associated with vadose zone expansion, and reduced connection between subsurface and surface water processes. Other causes include increased evaporative demand and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7327140255196829974", "cites_id": ["7327140255196829974"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/6073/2022/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ftl4wj07r2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 5}}
