Estimating the maximum LUE (\u03b5 max) is critical yet challenging for quantifying gross primary production (GPP) using LUE-based models. This study describes an analytical method for estimating \u03b5 max based on water use efficiency (WUE) as determined by plant water use and carbon gain. Unlike other complex parameterization schemes, this WUE-based method is simple and requires four variables relatively easy to acquire. The WUE-based \u03b5 max estimates compare favorably well with values based on traditional curve fitting method and that reported in the literature, and clearly distinguished \u03b5 max between C 3 (1.48\u00b10.33) and C 4 (2.63\u00b10.21) dominated ecosystems. The range in \u03b5 max estimates was narrow across different years and sites within a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2725063350032899057", "cites_id": ["2725063350032899057"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac263b/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Zslya1e0SUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
