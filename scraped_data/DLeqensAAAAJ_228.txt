This study investigates wildfire impacts on catchment mean annual streamflow for 14 Australian catchments that have been severely impacted by the 2009 Victoria wildfire, the second\u2010worst wildfire disaster in Australia. A statistical approach based on sensitivity coefficients was used for quantifying the climate variability impacts on streamflow and the time trend analysis method was used to estimate the annual streamflow changes due to wildfire respectively. Our results show that wildfire has caused a noticeable increase in mean annual streamflow in the catchments with a burnt area above 70% for an immediate post\u2010wildfire period (2009\u20132015) and the wildfire impact on streamflow is evidently larger than the climate change impact in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13840954694941566596", "cites_id": ["13840954694941566596"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.14439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hGZEaPbyFMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
