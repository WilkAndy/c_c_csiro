To quantify the impact of interannual climatic variability, in this study, we first clarify the content and definition of interannual climate elasticity that represents the sensitivity of streamflow to climatic variability from year to year and equals to the ratio of proportional annual change in streamflow and a climatic variable. Then, we analytically derive the interannual climate (i.e., potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) elasticities of streamflow by integrating the annual water balance with a conceptual hydrologic model (i.e., extended Budyko framework). At interannual scale, the terrestrial water storage change (i.e., \u2206S) is a substantial component of water balance equation. Consequently, the analytical solutions of the interannual climate elasticities are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8135578004946530512", "cites_id": ["8135578004946530512"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020WR027703", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0LBRYxdh53AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
