In the last four decades, soil conservation measures have accelerated and intensified. These measures were designed to reduce soil erosion, improve agricultural productivity, and enhance environmental quality. It is important to evaluate the effects of these measures on hydrology in order to develop sustainable catchment management plans in the region. This study evaluated changes in stream flow data for four selected catchments in the Loess Plateau following large\u2010scale soil conservation measures. The non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Kendall test was used to identify trends in annual stream flow and the results showed significant downward trends in three of the four catchments. The Pettitt test indicated that a change point occurred in 1978 in these three catchments. Annual precipitation in all the catchments showed no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7873388510069569234", "cites_id": ["7873388510069569234"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0rZWiSLlQ20J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 13, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 9, "2015": 19, "2016": 30, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 18, "2020": 21, "2021": 16, "2022": 22, "2023": 3}}
