This re-vegetation process will not only result in less soil erosion in the CSHC, but also less runoff due to increased evapotranspiration (ET). The impact on surface hydrology has, until now, been largely ignored in the implementation of the re-vegetation policy, even though water is a critical resource driving food security in support of the hundreds of millions of people in the region. To address this issue, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) Project LWR/2002/018 was developed to further understand this regional eco-hydrologic process and most importantly, to provide mid to senior policy makers and soil and water managers at national, regional and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6872139022290124430", "cites_id": ["6872139022290124430"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:a7d77398-7652-4f57-8bae-17c333092eac", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jv6z1ge-Xl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1}}
