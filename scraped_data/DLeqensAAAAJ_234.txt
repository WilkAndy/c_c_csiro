It is well established that estimates of whole-catchment water balance components, such as total excess water, can be made in a routine manner. In an equilibrium situation, total excess water will be equal to the amount of water appearing at the outlet of a catchment in a stream flow record. This is made up of two components: surface water and groundwater. We are concerned in this report with both these components, and how the time-scales associated with each of them affect water and salt fluxes from catchments.For small catchments, the time to reach a new water-balance equilibrium may be as little as a decade. Flow and salinity data collected for small catchments throughout the Murray-Darling Basin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6915526981385657859", "cites_id": ["6915526981385657859"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Warrick-Dawes/publication/266252240_Land_and_Water_Flow_Regime_Salt_Load_and_Salinity_Changes_in_Unregulated_Catchments_Interpretation_for_Modelling_the_Effects_of_Land-use_Change/links/55a7102208ae410caa751213/Land-and-Water-Flow-Regime-Salt-Load-and-Salinity-Changes-in-Unregulated-Catchments-Interpretation-for-Modelling-the-Effects-of-Land-use-Change.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ax4fSCbj-F8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
