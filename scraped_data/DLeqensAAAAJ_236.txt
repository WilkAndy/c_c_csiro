The partitioning of rainfall between these two pathways is a foundation concept of catchment hydrology. Measurement of many catchments for many years has shown us that the landuse in the catchment and the seasonality of the rainfall are important factors that influence this partitioning. Our understanding of catchment hydrology is approaching the point where we can confidently predict the partitioning of rainfall and how it changes when we change the land-use."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12455365939404721841", "cites_id": ["12455365939404721841"], "pub_url": "https://www.ewater.org.au/archive/crcch/archive/pubs/pdfs/technical200311.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sc63nVRZ2qwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
