However, whether and to what extent the enhanced extreme precipitation translates into changes in river floods remains controversial. Here we demonstrate that previously reported unapparent or even negative responses of river flood discharge (defined as annual maximum discharge) to extreme precipitation increases are largely caused by mixing the signals of floods with different generating mechanisms. Stratifying by flood type, we show a positive response of rainstorm-induced floods to extreme precipitation increases. However, this response is almost entirely offset by concurrent decreases in snow-related floods, leading to an overall unapparent change in total global floods in both historical observations and future climate projections. Our findings highlight an increasing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12661727698312444941", "cites_id": ["12661727698312444941"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01539-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DTyjxEF-t68J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 5}}
