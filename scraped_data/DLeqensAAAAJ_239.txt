Since hydropower and PV power depend strongly on precipitation and solar energy, previous studies have recognized that climate change can affect the stability of standalone hydro or PV power and can threaten energy security. However, the vast majority of research studies stop at the impact assessment per se and are unexpanded to hybrid power systems. The objective of this study was to explore how the complementary operation of this integrated system could be affected by climate change and identify its resilience to climate change. A \u201cclimate-hydrology-operation\u201d bottom-up framework was developed to determine the acceptable range of climate change in climatic exposure space where the system can succeed to operate.
