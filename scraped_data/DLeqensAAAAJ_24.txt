Water was applied through a drip irrigation system in three ways: alternate drip irrigation on partial roots (ADIP), fixed drip irrigation on partial roots (FDIP), even drip irrigation on whole roots (EDIW). For each irrigation method, water was applied when the soil moisture content was below either 65 or 55% of the field capacity. Results showed that when irrigation started at 65% of the field capacity ADIP significantly increased the root/shoot ratio compared to all the other treatments. When irrigating at this moderate (i.e. 65% of the field capacity) soil moisture level, ADIP did not significantly inhibit leaf photosynthesis, but did markedly restrict stomatal opening. Compared to EDIW, there was a relatively small reduction in biomass for ADIP, but the reduction for FDIP was significant. Surprisingly, ADIP maintained high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9868927867173765801", "cites_id": ["9868927867173765801"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423800002454", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qYLYfJt59YgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 13, "2007": 9, "2008": 10, "2009": 12, "2010": 15, "2011": 13, "2012": 10, "2013": 9, "2014": 9, "2015": 14, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 12, "2020": 17, "2021": 2, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
