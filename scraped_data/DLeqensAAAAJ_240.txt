Caijiazhuang catchment located within Haihe River basin, north China was selected as the study area. To detect the trend and changes in streamflow, Mann\u2013Kendall test was used. Elasticity and hydrological simulation methods were applied to assess the relative contribution of climate change and human activities on streamflow variability under three periods (baseline (1958\u20131977), impact I (1978\u20131997), and impact II (1998\u20132012)). The long-term hydro-climatic variables experienced substantial changes during the whole study period, and 1977 was the breaking year of streamflow change. Attribution analysis using the two methods showed consistent results: for impact I, climate change impacts explained 65% and 68 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15557604552705287740", "cites_id": ["15557604552705287740"], "pub_url": "https://iwaponline.com/jwcc/article-abstract/11/1/241/40788", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PKb_t-m259cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
