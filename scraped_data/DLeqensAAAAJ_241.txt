Conventional river models typically ignore this non-stationarity, and, hence, their predictions of declines in low flows during drought periods are likely to be compromised. The present study assesses non-stationarity and highlights its implications for river modelling. A quantile regression analysis showed non-stationarity of low flows in the Namoi catchment (Australia), with statistically significant downward trends in the 10th percentile of log-transformed baseflow (10-LTB). This highlighted the usefulness of the 10-LTB metric to identify non-stationarity and, hence, alert modellers to the importance of adopting models that explicitly account for groundwater processes when modelling such river systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14133583162771189524", "cites_id": ["14133583162771189524"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf16399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FC9r7ACTJMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
