Predictive confidence across these periods is when low using the more commonly used rainfall\u2013runoff models. Here we modified the GR4J model to better represent surface water\u2013groundwater connection and its role in runoff generation. The modified model (GR7J) was tested in 137 catchments in south-east Australia. Models were calibrated during \u201cwetter\u201d periods and simulation across drought periods was assessed against observations. GR7J performed better than GR4J in evaluation during drought periods where bias was significantly lower and showed improved fit across the flow duration curve especially at low flows. The largest improvements in predictive performance were for catchments where there were larger changes in the annual rainfall\u2013runoff relationship. The predictive performance of the GR7J model was more sensitive to objective function used than GR4J. The use of an objective function that combined daily and annual error produced a better goodness of fit when measured against 80, 50 and 20 percent excedance flow quantiles and reduced evaluation bias, especially for the GR7J model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3376922212151066109", "cites_id": ["3376922212151066109"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1016932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_f1jOdw83S4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
