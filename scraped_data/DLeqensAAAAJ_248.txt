This study assessed whether changes in management practices increased regional Ag WUE for a focus area covering 20% of the 300,000 km2 North China Plain (NCP). An \u2018input\u2013output\u2019definition of regional Ag WUE was used, where \u2018input\u2019is the water available over the crop growing season and \u2018output\u2019is grain yield. Regional databases of precipitation, irrigation and yield from 1984 to 1996 were established in a geographic information system (GIS) to calculate winter wheat and summer corn Ag WUE on a county basis. For wheat, the average Ag WUE was 7.0 kg/ha/mm in 1984, whereas in 1996 it was 14.3 kg/ha/mm. For corn, Ag WUE increased from 9.0 kg/ha/mm in 1984 to 10.1 kg/ha/mm in 1996, although values of more than 11.5 kg/ha/mm were obtained for both 1991 and 1992. Time series plots of the resulting Ag WUE and its components were generated to reveal spatial and temporal variability. Counties with a relatively high mean Ag WUE and a low year-to-year consistency were found to have the highest potential for improving Ag WUE management. Total county water resources (WR) were also calculated for the time series, and normalisation of Ag WUE and WR on a county basis also showed that there have been recent improvements in Ag WUE. For some counties in wet years, it may be possible to plant larger areas of crop to increase countylevel Ag WUE.
