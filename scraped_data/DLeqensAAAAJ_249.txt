But whether this change can occur in catchments that have also experienced vegetation change and whether it invalidates the most widely used methods for estimating impacts of vegetation change \u2013 i.e., the paired-catchment method (PCM), the time\u2013trend method (TTM), and the sensitivity-based method (SBM) \u2013 on runoff is still unknown and rarely discussed. Estimated inconsistent afforestation impacts were 32.8\u2009%, 93.5\u2009%, and 76.1\u2009% of total runoff changes in the Red Hill paired experimental catchments in Australia during the period of 1990\u20132015 by the PCM, TTM, and SBM, respectively. In addition to afforestation, the Red Hill paired experimental catchments have experienced a 10-year drought (2000\u20132009) and have been demonstrated to lead to non-stationary rainfall\u2013runoff relationships of paired catchments. Estimated impacts of vegetation change by the PCM (32.8\u2009%) is still reliable and is not invalided by multiyear drought-induced non-stationarity, because the PCM can eliminate all impacts by different factors on paired catchments (multiyear drought and climate variability), except the purposed treatment (afforestation). For the TTM and SBM, traditional application did not further differentiate different drivers of non-stationary rainfall\u2013runoff relationship (i.e., multiyear drought and vegetation change), which led to significant overestimation of afforestation effects. A new framework was further proposed to separate the effects of three factors on runoff changes, including vegetation change, climate variability, and hydroclimatic non-stationarity (i \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16091860143596241836", "cites_id": ["16091860143596241836"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/6379/2022/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rANS0orFUd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
