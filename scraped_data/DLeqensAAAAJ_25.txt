This study used 16 global climate models (GCMs) and three global warming scenarios to investigate changes in groundwater recharge rates for a 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate in the U.S. High Plains region. Groundwater recharge was modeled using the Soil\u2010Vegetation\u2010Atmosphere\u2010Transfer model WAVES for a variety of soil and vegetation types representative of the High Plains. The median projection under a 2050 climate includes increased recharge in the Northern High Plains (+8%), a slight decrease in the Central High Plains (\u22123%), and a larger decrease in the Southern High Plains (\u221210%), amplifying the current spatial trend in recharge from north to south.
