In the past three decades, over 5 Mha of cultivated land have been equipped with water-saving techniques (WSTs) in Northwest China to cope with water scarcity. However, the effect of WSTs on local climate and its mechanisms are not yet understood. Here, we have quantified the local climatic effect by comparing temperature and humidity at controlled and irrigated sites before and after the large-scale implementation of WST. Results show that the substantial reduction in irrigation water use has led to an average increase of 0.3 C in growing-season temperature and reduced relative humidity by 2%. Near-surface air temperature responds nonlinearly to percentage area of WST and a threshold value of 40% is found before any noticeable warming effect over the study area. Moreover, it is found that regions with relatively humid climates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10621799799897398448", "cites_id": ["10621799799897398448"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4b52/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sBwzLKQ2aJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
