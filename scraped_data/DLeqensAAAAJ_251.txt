In this paper, a tracer-aided approach has been developed and applied to quantify the relationships between groundwater storage and discharge, upon which the dynamics of groundwater storage and its residence time are assessed. Robust nonlinear storage-discharge relationships are found for the eight studied catchments located in a headwater region of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The dynamics of groundwater storage for all the studied catchments largely show synchronization with regional climate. The estimated highest and active groundwater storages in a year are more responsive to precipitation than the lowest storages. For all the studied catchments, during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3457311542005850482", "cites_id": ["3457311542005850482"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169421002778", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cuEdo4fW-i8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
