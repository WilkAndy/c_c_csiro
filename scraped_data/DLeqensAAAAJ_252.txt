However, hydrological conditions may not change abruptly at a certain time, but rather evolve gradually over a period. We propose a trend-based time-varying approach that does not require these prerequisites to assess the climate- and human-induced impacts on hydrological conditions in the Pearl River Basin (PRB), China, which can be applied in other basins. The trend-based time-varying approach detects human activities exert a significant seasonal regulation on streamflow (i.e. 113% of the decreases in the wet season and 93% of the increases in the dry season) and 101% of the reductions in flood peaks in the East River Basin, the sub-basin with the highest ratio of total reservoir storage capacity to river discharge in the PRB \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=794594615302678871", "cites_id": ["794594615302678871"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02626667.2020.1785625", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V-mNuZf3BgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
