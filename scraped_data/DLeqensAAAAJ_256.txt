Errors in simulating LUC impacts on ET largely stem from LUC data interpretation (LI, ie mapping of gridded LUC data into annual plant function types) and model structure (MS, ie parameterization of land-surface processes). The objective of this study was to benchmark ET estimates from four LSMs using the Zhang-curve, a prototype of the Budyko framework that has been validated against global hydrological observations and used widely to quantify the impacts of LUC on ET. A framework was further proposed to quantify and attribute errors in estimated ET changes induced by LI or MS. Results showed that all LSMs underestimated ET changes by about 55 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=499489678800952", "cites_id": ["499489678800952"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac38db/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OLjfgEjGAQAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
