The objective of this study was to determine the spatial variation of ET partitioning (T/ET) and the inter\u2010annual dependencies of T/ET on vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). The investigation was conducted at the global scale based on seven global datasets and at the point scale at 37 flux sites. The spatial variations of T/ET were divided into three phases, that is, the rapidly increasing phase (P1), slowly increasing phase (P2), and decreasing phase (P3), which were located in arid and cold regions, temperate regions, and tropical rainforest regions, respectively. The three\u2010phase spatial variations were primarily driven by the different spatial variations of the two water use pathways (i.e., transpiration, T \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12348232773927702532", "cites_id": ["12348232773927702532"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JD033756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BBDMvUi8XasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
