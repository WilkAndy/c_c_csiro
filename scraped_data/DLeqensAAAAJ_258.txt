The water balance and the hydrological cycle are significantly important for vegetation restoration in water-limited regions, and these dynamics are still poorly understood. In this study, the soil moisture and water balance were modelled with the stochastic soil water balance model in the Loess Plateau, China. This model was verified by monitoring soil moisture data of black locust plantations in the Yangjuangou catchment in the Loess Plateau. The influences of a rainfall regime change on soil moisture and water balance were also explored. Three meteorological stations were selected (Yulin, Yan'an, and Luochuan) along the precipitation gradient to detect the effects of rainfall spatial variability on the soil moisture and water balance. The results showed that soil moisture \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1864368060796213440", "cites_id": ["1864368060796213440"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/earth-and-environmental-science-transactions-of-royal-society-of-edinburgh/article/stochastic-soil-moisture-dynamic-modelling-a-case-study-in-the-loess-plateau-china/750E7759375A9BA637739A333DF1BD94", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wJhXmt-Q3xkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
