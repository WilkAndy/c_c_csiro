While plantations can present significant benefits, their potential impact on streamflow needs to be considered. It is important that this information be incorporated into the development of water resources management strategies.The National Water Initiative (NWI) recognises that large-scale plantation forestry is one example of a type of land use change which has the potential to intercept significant volumes of surface and/or ground water now and in the future. Many of the catchments that may sustain significant areas of new plantations are biophysically complex, with varying rainfall, soil depths and textures, groundwater characteristics and possible planting locations. All of these factors can lead to variability in the potential impacts of any new plantation development on catchment water yield."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11465879672198014191", "cites_id": ["11465879672198014191"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42755395/Methods_to_Assess_Water_Allocation_Impac20160216-1947-fbac1w.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7yS8ItD8Hp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
