Currently, agricultural water use accounts for over 70% of the total water usage. To ensure China 's food security, it is necessary to promote water-saving agriculture, which is considered as an integrated system including four components: rational utilization of agricultural water resources, water-saving irrigation, agronomic water-saving techniques, and agricultural management. This paper reviews the current status of the water-saving agricultural research in China. It outlines some of the problems in the current agricultural systems and discussed the potential of the various techniques and measures for improving overall water use efficiency. It is suggested that biological and engineering measures need to be integrated. There is also a need to establish a commercial environment for promoting water-saving agricultural technology.
