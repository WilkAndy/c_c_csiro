BackgroundThe \u201cMethods to Accurately Assess Water Allocation Impacts of Plantations\u201d project aims to develop methods to improve the accuracy of the assessment of the surface water allocation impacts of plantations. The first component of the project is the application of the Forest Cover Flow Change (FCFC) model (Brown et al. 2006) to a range of case-study catchments. A series of workshops were held to communicate the results of this section of the project, and to gain feedback on the FCFC modelling and case-study selections."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=302255166490327150", "cites_id": ["302255166490327150"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0b5a39543cee764c4af623e3dc5aad10a1754cd3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:brgu9njTMQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
