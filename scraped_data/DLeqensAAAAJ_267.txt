Canberra, CSIRO, 9-37, 1998", "author": "L Zhang and WR Dawes", "journal": "WAVES: an integrated energy and water balance model. Canberra, CSIRO", "pages": "9-37", "abstract": "The physical and biological processes describing the surface water, energy and solute balances of the plant\u2013soil\u2013atmosphere system are, in general, well understood. Models of that system can be formulated at almost any level of complexity with as many or as few processes as required. The level of model complexity is usually determined by the application.Historically, physically based models have been developed to represent the real world with increasing detail. The place and use of such models, and the information contained in the data required to run them, have been debated in hydrology literature for over 20 years, most recently by Beven (1989, 1993), Hauhs (1990), Wheater and Jakeman (1993) and Barnes (1993). These authors argue that physically based models are most appropriately used in exploring the interactions between processes and fluxes under different management and/or climatic regimes, given clearly stated assumptions about which small-scale processes are relevant."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5972770606534686569", "cites_id": ["5972770606534686569"], "pub_url": "https://research.csiro.au/software/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/07/chap2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:afdktziL41IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
