Studying its evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (Kc) is important for managing water-saving irrigation in the region. Eddy covariance (EC) was applied to measure spring maize ET in 2007 in northwest China, focusing on the characteristics of the maize ET and Kc processes under plastic mulch. An interesting result was that a higher Kc in this study relative to the value of FAO 56 was presented in the mid and late season, e.g. average Kc was 1.46, 1.39 and 1.22 during the heading, filling and maturity stage, respectively. This result was mainly due to that (1) the plastic mulch had an effect on anti-senescence of maize and great green leaf still existed before the harvest; (2) the FAO 56 PM model may underestimate the reference crop ET in the mid and late season of maize in the region; (3) the planting density was higher in the study \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4072642731871040512", "cites_id": ["4072642731871040512"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377408001169", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:APQ_ovzuhDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 16, "2015": 10, "2016": 13, "2017": 30, "2018": 19, "2019": 20, "2020": 20, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
