The selected two ecosystems are woodland savanna in Daly River and eucalyptus forest in Tumbarumba. The WAVES model was first manually calibrated and validated against soil water content measured by cosmic-ray probe and evapotranspiration measured with eddy flux techniques. The calibrated model was then used to simulate long-term water balance components with observed climate data at two sites. Analyzing the trends and variabilities of potential evapotranspiration and precipitation is used to interpret the climate change impacts on ecosystem water balance. The results showed that the WAVES model can accurately simulate soil water content \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13102864391579289090", "cites_id": ["13102864391579289090"], "pub_url": "https://iwaponline.com/jwcc/article-abstract/13/2/1073/85845", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AsYyAL651rUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
