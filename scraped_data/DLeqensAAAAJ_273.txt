However, at present, our understanding about multi\u2010year drought\u2010induced changes in catchment hydrological behaviours and its driving factors at the process level is still very limited. This study proposed a new approach using a data assimilation technique with a process\u2010based hydrological model to detect multi\u2010year drought\u2010induced changes in catchment hydrological behaviours and to identify driving factors for the changes in an unimpaired Australian catchment (Wee Jasper) which experienced prolonged drought from 1997 to 2009. Modelling experiments demonstrated that the multi\u2010year drought caused a significant change in the catchment rainfall\u2010runoff relationship, indicated by significant step changes in the estimated time\u2010variant hydrological parameters SC (indicating catchment active water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4124402128331035453", "cites_id": ["4124402128331035453"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.14289", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PVMJOuLRPDkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
