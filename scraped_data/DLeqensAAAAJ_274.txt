These three methods have yielded consistent results in many paired-catchment studies, except at the Red Hill experimental site in Australia. However, reasons for the inconsistency have not yet been identified. The objective of this study was to identify the reasons for the inconsistency amongst results using observations of two paired catchments from 1990 to 2015. Results from these three methods showed that afforestation accounted for 32.8\u2009%, 93.5\u2009%, and 76.1\u2009% of total runoff changes, respectively. The inconsistency in results were still apparent even the longest available observation record was used. The rainfall-runoff relationship of the control catchment has been used only in the paired-catchment method. This relationship was confirmed to become non-stationary during the pre- and post-calibration periods due to a 10-year prolonged drought, leading to the inconsistency amongst results. By eliminating drought's effects on the rainfall-runoff relationship of the control catchment, afforestation\u2019s contribution to runoff reduction was 73.4\u2009% using the paired-catchment method, agreeing well the other two methods. This study not only revealed the reason for the inconsistent results that had long been observed at the famous experimental site, but also proved, using experimental observations, that prolonged drought can induce non-stationary rainfall-runoff relationship in catchment. It also demonstrated that the stationarity test is vital for correct use of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13946946673743548323", "cites_id": ["13946946673743548323"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2021-5/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o8_MDRuCjcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
