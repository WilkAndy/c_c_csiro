Here we present an alternative deficit-based\" flipped\" bucket model and analyse the results when applied to a number of catchments in south eastern Australia. In conceptual bucket models, a full bucket means a catchment is wet, while drainage or evapotranspiration cause the bucket storage to decline. However, since a bucket can be empty (zero storage), such models have a\" driest possible state\" that may not be reached in reality. When a model approaches this empty state, evapotranspiration approaches zero, which means the model may cease to track the moisture deficit accumulated during continuing dry conditions. In turn, the incorrect moisture deficit may cause overestimation of runoff from subsequent rainfall events, leading to long-term model bias if dry conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6864275359507021541", "cites_id": ["6864275359507021541"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140493801&h=tNMNW3Ef4ZlJXJcV9d6yNyQKKGkTyB%2B25FLA5HqP%2B13YZQcoVy4k24cJQnKsowRZSr%2FnbmrN6DqhK29hGm2hTA%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5f7hKxLOQl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
