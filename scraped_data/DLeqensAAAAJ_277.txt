Potter et al.(2011) suggested that across 34 unimpaired catchments in SEA the area weighted reduction in streamflow during the drought was 46 percent. Sixty-five percent of this was attributed to reduction in annual rainfall and 7 percent to the direct or indirect effect of changes in average annual maximum temperature. The remaining 28 percent was unexplained residual; potentially due to changes in seasonality and inter-annual variability of rainfall; and/or anthropogenic change (ie in particular farm dams); and/or change in vegetation or a change in dominant hydrological behaviour. In this study we aim to develop a conceptual understanding of why the reductions in runoff under the recent drought have been so large and why the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5180035221962657720", "cites_id": ["5180035221962657720"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP115083&sb=RECENT&n=7&rpp=10&page=17&tr=5035&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uI8Y4ZYu40cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
