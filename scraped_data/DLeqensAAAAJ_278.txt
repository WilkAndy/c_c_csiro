Small scale disposal basins are becoming more common as a means of disposing of drainage water from groundwater pumping or sub-surface drainage. To be economically viable, the volumes of water to be disposed of must be minimised as much as possible, while still controlling saline watertables adequately for healthy vegetation growth. There have been a number of field-based studies aimed at determining \"safe\" watertable depths, but these have been relatively short term and based on a small number of soil types and land uses. The general rule of thumb developed in these studies are unlikely to be able to account for the climatic variability and range of soils, land uses and irrigations regimes which are present in the Murray-Darling Basin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16391712518971386357", "cites_id": ["16391712518971386357"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.707754187484634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9emcYbAPe-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
