This climate-induced hydrological nonstationarity could affect the reliability of future runoff projection developed using a hydrological model calibrated for the historical period as the model or parameters may no longer be suitable under a different future hydroclimate. This paper explores whether competing parameterization approaches proposed to account for hydrological nonstationarity could improve the robustness of future runoff projection compared to the traditional approach where the model is calibrated targeting overall model performance over the entire historical period. The modeling experiments are carried out using climate and streamflow datasets from southeastern Australia, which has experienced a long drought and exhibited noticeable hydrological nonstationarity. The results show that robust multicriteria \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/23/11/JHM-D-21-0102.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CBwN2h2txvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
