We examined the lake water balance responses to meteorological and hydrological variables. The results show that the lake areas greatly expanded by a maximum of 27.1% (or 43.7 km2) between 1998 and 2005. This expansion appears to be associated with an increase in annual precipitation of 51.0 mm (12.6%), mean annual and winter mean temperature increases of 0.41 \u00b0C and 0.71 \u00b0C, and an annual runoff increase of 20% during the last decade. The changes point to an abrupt increase in the annual precipitation, mean temperature and runoff occurring in 1996, 1998 and 1997, respectively, and a decrease in the annual pan \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13203529725407611009", "cites_id": ["13203529725407611009"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818109000514", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gUg7eFRcPLcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 15, "2014": 24, "2015": 8, "2016": 20, "2017": 16, "2018": 21, "2019": 17, "2020": 8, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
