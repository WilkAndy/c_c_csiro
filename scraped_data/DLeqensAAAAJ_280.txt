In this study, we focus on the extended application of Fu's equation (one formulation of the Budyko-type curves) to 371 large irrigation districts in China over a period of 2010\u20132017. Water balance method was used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ET) in the irrigated areas. Considering the contribution of shallow groundwater to ET, the water availability in the Budyko framework defined as equivalent precipitation (Pe) for irrigation areas is the sum of irrigation water (I), precipitation (P) and groundwater evaporation (ETgw). Results showed that the relationships between evapotranspiration (ET), water availability (Pe) and energy supply (ET0) can be accurately described by the Budyko's curves. The Fu's equation performed better in humid and semi-humid regions than arid and semi-arid regions. The comparison between \u03b4ET/\u03b4Pe and \u03b4ET/\u03b4ET0 confirmed the relative effect of water availability and energy supply on ET according to the variation of climatic conditions. The optimal values of Budyko parameter \u03c9 for each irrigation district was obtained with multi-annual data using least square method. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and soil property (denoted by the proportion of clay and sand) were selected to develop empirical equation for parameter \u03c9 using multiple linear regression analysis method. This study showed that the Budyko framework can be extended to irrigation areas and provide useful information on evapotranspiration to assist in water management in irrigation areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/hess-2021-80/", "cites_per_year": {}}
