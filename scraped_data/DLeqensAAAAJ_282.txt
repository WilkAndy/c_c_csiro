During the drought, less runoff was generated for a given rainfall in comparison to other dry years. However, shifts in the rainfall-runoff behaviour were very prominent in some catchments, but not in others. We attempt to explain this variability in catchment drought response using a multimodel inference approach. We systematically analyse the relative role of 37 potentially influential factors, including both catchment and drought characteristics. We found that historically drier catchments, catchments with higher interannual variability of groundwater storage, less seasonal rainfall regime, and deeper soils had larger runoff deficits for a given rainfall during the decadal drought in comparison with shorter droughts. Interestingly, these most informative factors can, in theory, be known before the drought \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1915946S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
