It is difficult for traditional regionalization methods to determine unique relationships between calibrated parameter values and catchment characteristics due to equifinality. Regional calibration can be used to overcome the equifinality problem. In a regional calibration, a hydrological model is calibrated to obtain a single set of parameter values that produce overall good estimates of streamflow for all catchments considered. The objective of this study is to investigate the applicability and benefits of the regional calibration method for predicting streamflow in ungauged catchments. In this study, a macro-scale hydrologic model, VIC-3L, was applied to the catchments in south-eastern Australia. The regional calibration method was validated in time and space. For the 104 catchments in the calibration set, the medians of the Nash \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.918186740830525", "cites_per_year": {}}
