The sequential data assimilation method, such as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), has the potential to improve the forecasting skill. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of EnKF on the skills of monthly streamflow forecasts derived with an ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP) at 38 catchments in East Australia. In ESP, monthly streamflow forecasts were produced with a conceptual rainfall-runoff model together with the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration re-sampled from the historical records prior to the forecast time. EnKF was then implemented to update the state variables (i.e., the status of soil moisture and groundwater stores) in the rainfall-runoff model continuously for each member of the ensemble forecasts. The results showed that ESP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.903802087019195", "cites_per_year": {}}
