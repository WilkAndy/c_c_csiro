This paper illustrates how a land-use change model, Forest Cover Flow Change (FCFC), can be linked to a river planning model, the Integrated Quantity and Quality Model (IQQM), using the Murrumbidgee valley as an example. Linking the two models enables the effect of potential plantation expansion on flow to be assessed in terms of impacts on downstream water users\u2019 allocations and diversions. To derive an envelope of responses two plantation expansion scenarios were considered, the planting of 30 000 ha in areas that will result in the largest reduction in mean annual water yield, and the planting of 30 000 ha in areas that will have the smallest reduction.
