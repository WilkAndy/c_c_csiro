A flow duration curve (FDC) displays the relationship between any given flow and the percentage of time that flow is exceeded. This paper provides a method for linking the current understanding of the impact of vegetation on the mean annual water balance to changes in the daily FDC. The FDC is described by five parameters, the conditional median (median flow for days when flow exceeds a given threshold), the cease to flow percentile and three curve fitting parameters. The parameters of FDC model are then linked to a mean annual water balance model using daily rainfall data, thus allowing the FDC to be adjusted to changes in vegetation. Two methods are proposed for linking the mean annual water balance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.H32C0595B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
