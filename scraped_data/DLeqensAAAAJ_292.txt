It has been shown that the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation (referred as the index of dryness) can be used to estimate mean annual evapotranspiration with a parameter. This study evaluates the effects of climatic and catchment characteristics on the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into evapotranspiration using a rational function approach, which was developed based on phenomenological considerations. Over 460 catchments worldwide with long-term record of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were considered and results show that model estimates of mean annual evapotranspiration agree well with observed evapotranspiration taken as the difference between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003EAEJA.....1374Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
