The starting point for the analyses was the assumption that rainfall and vegetation age are the principal drivers of evapotranspiration. The objective was to remove the variability in the rainfall signal, leaving changes in streamflow solely attributable to the evapotranspiration of the plantation trees. Data from 4 catchments from Australian catchments were used. A model was developed to firstly characterise changes in each flow decile over time, and then to construct FDCs adjusted for average rainfall. The model returned encouraging results, with satisfactory fits found for the majority of deciles at the 4 catchments, particularly the high flow (10th - 50th) percentiles. The adjusted FDCs revealed very similar trends in flow reductions at the 3 small catchments with a proportionally higher impact on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.358307332719072", "cites_per_year": {}}
