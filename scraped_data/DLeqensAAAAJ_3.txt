It has been shown that the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation (referred as the index of dryness) can be used to estimate mean annual evapotranspiration by using one additional parameter. This study evaluates the effects of climatic and catchment characteristics on the partitioning of mean annual precipitation into evapotranspiration using a rational function approach, which was developed based on phenomenological considerations. Over 470 catchments worldwide with long\u2010term records of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff were considered, and results show that model estimates of mean annual evapotranspiration agree well with observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 887, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10555612284802927459", "cites_id": ["10555612284802927459"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003WR002710", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y4ttbnIRfZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 6, "2006": 15, "2007": 14, "2008": 12, "2009": 19, "2010": 24, "2011": 27, "2012": 24, "2013": 30, "2014": 38, "2015": 54, "2016": 56, "2017": 77, "2018": 74, "2019": 76, "2020": 75, "2021": 100, "2022": 108, "2023": 48}}
