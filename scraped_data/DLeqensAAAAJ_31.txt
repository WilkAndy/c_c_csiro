The prevailing cropping practice in this region, growing winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a monoculture, carries two major drawbacks which arise during the fallow period from July to September: firstly, an exposure to soil erosion from rainstorms and, secondly, poor water storage efficiency of rain. Alternative cropping systems were therefore investigated. They comprised four rotations, each of 3 or 4 years, involving different combinations of corn (Zea mays L.), wheat, broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), and pea (Pisum sativum L.). The water use efficiencies (WUEs) and sustainability of the rotations were evaluated at Changwu Agri-ecological Station in the Loess Plateau from 1984 to 1996. Results showed that two of the rotations gave significantly improved grain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12432475068520797485", "cites_id": ["12432475068520797485"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167198703000655", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LRUVajQGiawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 10, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 21, "2017": 11, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
