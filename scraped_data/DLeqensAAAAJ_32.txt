However, in practice, we suspect that changing climatic conditions may affect runoff generation processes and cause changes in the rainfall\u2010runoff relationship. In this article, we investigate whether temporary but prolonged (i.e., of the order of a decade) shifts in rainfall result in changes in rainfall\u2010runoff relationships at the catchment scale. Annual rainfall and runoff records from south\u2010eastern Australia are used to examine whether interdecadal climate variability induces changes in hydrological behavior. We test statistically whether annual rainfall\u2010runoff relationships are significantly different during extended dry periods, compared with the historical norm. The results demonstrate that protracted drought led to a significant shift in the rainfall\u2010runoff \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15834377056723469896", "cites_id": ["15834377056723469896"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014WR015348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SAaZ-QkCv9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 18, "2019": 16, "2020": 34, "2021": 33, "2022": 36, "2023": 10}}
