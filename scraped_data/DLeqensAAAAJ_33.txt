During the planning, because of ambiguous or uncertain information caused by the vagueness of decision makers\u2019 subjective preference or the uncertainty of objective information, conventional multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model is not suitable for such decision-making in such fuzzy environment. In this study, we proposed the fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) model with triangular fuzzy numbers and transformed the FMOLP model and its corresponding fuzzy goal programming (FGP) problem to crisp ones which can be solved by the conventional programming methods. The FMOLP model was applied to crop area planning of Liang Zhou region, Gansu province of northwest China, and then the optimal cropping patterns under different water-saving levels and satisfaction grades for water resources \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16909594345779280757", "cites_id": ["16909594345779280757"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377410002775", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dbsgdHfyquoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 9, "2014": 12, "2015": 17, "2016": 18, "2017": 20, "2018": 19, "2019": 14, "2020": 23, "2021": 14, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
