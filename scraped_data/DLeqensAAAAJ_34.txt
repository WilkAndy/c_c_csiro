As runoff from the mountainous parts of the region steadily decrease and water resources become overcommitted, serious water and environmental problems have resulted. These include drying-up of rivers, decline in groundwater levels, degradation of lakes and wetlands, and water pollution. Thus, 4000,km of the lower reaches of the Hai River \u2013 some 40% of its length \u2013 has experienced zero flows and, as result, parts of this river have become an ephemeral stream. The area of wetland within the Basin has decreased from 10,000,km2 at the beginning of 1950s to 1,000km2 at present. Over-extraction of groundwater occurs beneath 70% of the North China Plain, with the total groundwater over-extraction estimated at 90,billion m3. Thus, problems of water shortage and related environmental issues \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3306048307140507688", "cites_id": ["3306048307140507688"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11269-006-9051-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KDhkTWtx4S0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 8, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 13, "2013": 14, "2014": 15, "2015": 17, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 14, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
