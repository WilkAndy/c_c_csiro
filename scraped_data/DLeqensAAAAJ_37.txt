This paper presents a review of recent methods used to bias correct precipitation from regional climate models (RCMs). The paper then assesses four bias correction methods applied to the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model simulated precipitation, and the follow-on impact on modelled runoff for eight catchments in southeast Australia. Overall, the best results are produced by either quantile mapping or a newly proposed two-state gamma distribution mapping method. However, the differences between the methods are small in the modelling experiments here (and as reported in the literature), mainly due to the substantial corrections required and inconsistent errors over time (non-stationarity). The errors in bias corrected precipitation are typically amplified in modelled runoff. The tested methods cannot overcome limitations of the RCM in simulating precipitation sequence, which affects runoff generation. Results further show that whereas bias correction does not seem to alter change signals in precipitation means, it can introduce additional uncertainty to change signals in high precipitation amounts and, consequently, in runoff. Future climate change impact studies need to take this into account when deciding whether to use raw or bias corrected RCM results. Nevertheless, RCMs will continue to improve and will become increasingly useful for hydrological applications as the bias in RCM simulations reduces."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2488616099688517876", "cites_id": ["2488616099688517876"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/19/711/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9JBATChXiSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 17, "2017": 26, "2018": 16, "2019": 23, "2020": 25, "2021": 12, "2022": 26, "2023": 11}}
