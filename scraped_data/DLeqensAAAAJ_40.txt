However, due to the different methods used to assess the impact of forest cover at the annual and sub-annual timescale general conclusions can be difficult to draw. In this paper, consistent methods of analysing paired catchment data are used to assess the impact of forest cover change in afforestation and deforestation experiments on annual streamflow and flow duration curves (FDCs). The results indicate that in catchments undergoing a permanent change in forest cover it takes between 8 and 25years for a catchment to reach a new equilibrium. Analysis of FDCs showed that three types of responses could be observed. These are: catchments with changes in the number of zero flow days (response group 1), catchments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1304817657314751478", "cites_id": ["1304817657314751478"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412011146", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9jPnAL-kGxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 14, "2017": 15, "2018": 15, "2019": 20, "2020": 16, "2021": 26, "2022": 21, "2023": 5}}
