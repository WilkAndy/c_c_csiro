The impact on flow regime, as described by the annual flow duration curve (FDC) is less certain. A method to assess the impact of plantation establishment on FDCs was developed. The starting point for the analyses was the assumption that rainfall and vegetation age are the principal drivers of evapotranspiration. A key objective was to remove the variability in the rainfall signal, leaving changes in streamflow solely attributable to the evapotranspiration of the plantation. A method was developed to (1) fit a model to the observed annual time series of FDC percentiles; i.e. 10th percentile for each year of record with annual rainfall and plantation age as parameters, (2) replace the annual rainfall variation with the long term mean to obtain climate adjusted FDCs, and (3) quantify changes in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 153, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5338067901560800461", "cites_id": ["5338067901560800461"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169405000077", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zURyY3mgFEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 11, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 12, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
