Forty-one studies that measured recharge from across Australia were reviewed to generate a database. Studies were characterised on the basis of broad soil type (sand or non-sand), land-use/vegetation (annual, perennial, or trees), and annual rainfall. Attempts to develop quantitative recharge relationships met with limited success because of the limited geographical coverage of the studies, lack of details on the study sites, and high variability in the data. Nevertheless, the following relationships for annual vegetation were statistically valid: Ln(recharge) = \u201319.03 + 3.63 ln(rainfall) [for sandy soils]; F(1, 96) = 149.03; R2 = 0.60 Ln(recharge) = \u201312.65 + 2.41 ln(rainfall) [for non-sandy soils]; F(1,151) = 46.87 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 153, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12216651979570230141", "cites_id": ["12216651979570230141"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR00057", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fTPbsj9EiqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 9, "2004": 7, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 7, "2009": 8, "2010": 15, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 12, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
