In recent years the Yellow River has experienced significant changes in its hydrological regime, including an increased number of zero\u2010flow days. These changes have serious implications for water security and basin management. We investigated changes in stream flow regime of four headwater catchments since the 1950s. The rank\u2010based non\u2010parametric Mann\u2013Kendall test was used to detect trends in annual stream flow. The results showed no significant trend for the period 1956 to 2000. However, change\u2010point analysis showed that a significant change in annual stream flow occurred around 1990, and hence the stream\u2010flow data can be divided into two periods: 1956\u20131990 and 1991\u20132000. There was a considerable difference in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12768851469786336387", "cites_id": ["12768851469786336387"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6280", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g8xWbsISNLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 16, "2017": 6, "2018": 14, "2019": 8, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
