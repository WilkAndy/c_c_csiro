Water, food, energy, and climate are linked through complex webs of direct and indirect effects and feedbacks. Land use is undergoing major changes due not only to pressures for more efficient food, feed, and fiber production to support growing populations but also due to policy shifts that are creating markets for biofuel and agricultural carbon sequestration. Hydrologic systems embody flows of water, solutes, sediments, and energy that vary even in the absence of human activity. Understanding land use impacts thus necessitates integrated scientific approaches. Field measurements, remote sensing, and modeling studies are shedding new light on the modes and mechanisms by which land use changes impact water resources. Such studies can help \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4305349152694163015", "cites_id": ["4305349152694163015"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009WR007937", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R1ZdYD6svzsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 5, "2015": 13, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 15, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 21, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
