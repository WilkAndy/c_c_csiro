Two common methods for estimating vegetation effects on streamflow are the paired catchment method and the time trend analysis technique. In this study, the performance of these methods is evaluated using data from paired catchments in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Results show that these methods generally yield consistent estimates of the vegetation effect, and most of the observed streamflow changes are attributable to vegetation change. These estimates are realistic and are supported by the vegetation history. The accuracy of the estimates, however, largely depends on the length of calibration periods or pretreatment periods. For catchments with short or no pretreatment periods, we find that statistically identified prechange periods can be used as calibration periods. Because streamflow also responds to climate variability, in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 143, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16829861587931531569", "cites_id": ["16829861587931531569"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009WR007702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MYmmH_Ktj-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 14, "2016": 14, "2017": 14, "2018": 15, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
