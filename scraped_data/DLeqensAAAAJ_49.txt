However, estimates of evapotranspiration using remote sensing data are usually instantaneous values and to obtain daily evapotranspiration at a regional scale, it is necessary to convert these values into daily totals. By using the data obtained during the HAPEX-MOBILHY experiment in southwestern France, two different methods of converting instantaneous evapotranspiration into daily totals were evaluated. The first method is based on the assumption that the diurnal course of evapotranspiration is similar to that of solar irradiance and can be approximated by a sine function. As a result, daily evapotranspiration can be obtained from one instantaneous measurement. The second method assumes that the evaporative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3481371531269523206", "cites_id": ["3481371531269523206"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016819239402181I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bkd6bPZQUDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 9, "2007": 8, "2008": 14, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 14, "2022": 11}}
