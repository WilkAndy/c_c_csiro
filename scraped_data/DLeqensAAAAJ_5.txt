A field experiment was conducted for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during the period 1995\u20131998 to evaluate the effects of limited irrigation on yield and water use efficiency. A controlled soil water deficit, either mild or severe, was applied at different stages of crop growth. Photosynthesis rate, soil water content, and root and shoot dry mass accumulation were measured. Final grain yields and total water consumption were recorded, and the water use efficiency and harvest index were calculated. The results showed that, in different growing periods, evapotranspiration, grain yield, biomass, water use efficiency (WUE), and harvest index depended on the controlled ranges of soil water content. Grain yield response to irrigation varied considerably due to differences in soil moisture contents and irrigation scheduling between seasons \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 669, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12976515231044218727", "cites_id": ["12976515231044218727"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377401001809", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zy_WoNnXFbQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 7, "2004": 7, "2005": 11, "2006": 17, "2007": 22, "2008": 12, "2009": 25, "2010": 22, "2011": 36, "2012": 29, "2013": 38, "2014": 50, "2015": 56, "2016": 57, "2017": 51, "2018": 56, "2019": 48, "2020": 37, "2021": 36, "2022": 33, "2023": 16}}
