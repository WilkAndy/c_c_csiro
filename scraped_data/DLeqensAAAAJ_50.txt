Regionalization is typically used to estimate parameter values of hydrological predictive tools for catchments without observed streamflow. This study proposes a new regionalization method, called the index model. The index model establishes a nonparametric relationship between each parameter of predictive tools and a linear combination of predicators. This method is able to describe a wide range of functions, linear or nonlinear, and avoids the potential misspecification which usually occurs as a result of using the ordinary linear regression. We illustrate the method by predicting flow duration curves at 227 unimpaired catchments in southeast Australia. This study also compares results from regional models based on the linear regression \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1086869548738011968", "cites_id": ["1086869548738011968"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169410003240", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QOO3mRhWFQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 16, "2016": 19, "2017": 17, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 14, "2021": 16, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
