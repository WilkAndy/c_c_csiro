This paper presents several examples of observed \u2018hydrologic non-stationarity\u2019 in far south-eastern Australia exposed by the prolonged 1997\u20132009 \u201cMillennium\u201d drought, focussing on the implications of this hydrologic non-stationarity on hydrological modelling and prediction. The runoff decline during the drought was unprecedented in the instrumental historical record. It was caused not only by the lower annual rainfall, but also by changes in other climate characteristics (lack of any high rainfall years, change in rainfall seasonality and higher temperatures) and dominant hydrological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3903550114702029342", "cites_id": ["3903550114702029342"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00477-013-0755-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HvK_vSUyLDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 19, "2016": 9, "2017": 12, "2018": 17, "2019": 13, "2020": 18, "2021": 14, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
