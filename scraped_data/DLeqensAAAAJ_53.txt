Tree planting will reduce river flows and recharge to groundwater and, in certain circumstances, may lead to short-term worsening of river salinity prior to any improvement. Reductions in flow will be particularly problematic during dry spells, when water resources are sorely stretched. Most of the likely hydrologic impacts of afforestation can be predicted using current catchment models, but new field data are needed to test and improve their accuracy. Reductions in river flow induced by afforestation can be minimised with careful planning, and various strategies to minimise impact are recommended. It is argued that a regulatory framework needs to be erected to control the development of new plantations in order to complement other policies to preserve water resources, such as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16099892554034492827", "cites_id": ["16099892554034492827"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00049158.2003.10674890", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m7UuHfpObt8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 6, "2004": 12, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 15, "2008": 12, "2009": 8, "2010": 7, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
