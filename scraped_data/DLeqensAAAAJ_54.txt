These interannual models of catchment water balance assume that the principal variables controlling annual evapotranspiration are potential evapotranspiration and annual rainfall. Based on a dataset of unimpaired streamflow in Australia, we specifically test whether annual evapotranspiration ratios (i.e. the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to annual rainfall) follow Budyko\u2019s curve and other related curves. We consider the effect on predictions of evapotranspiration and streamflow of the shape of the curve used. Rainfall seasonality is shown to be important in determining the shape of the optimal curve used to model annual evapotranspiration ratios. Many catchments, particularly with summer-dominant rainfall, followed a stricter energy limit than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5388547044743867643", "cites_id": ["5388547044743867643"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169409001073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-2xwyfz2x0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 17, "2017": 14, "2018": 12, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 8}}
