The physiological control on transpiration is a canopy resistance calculated as a function of net CO2 assimilation rate, the vapour pressure deficit and the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface. The soil hydrology is modelled using the Richards equation and evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. A unique feature of the model is the modification of the vapour pressure deficit below the canopy as a function of the degree of atmospheric coupling. The model was tested using the energy flux and soil moisture measurements from the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) and Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment and Moddlisation du Bilan Hydrique (HAPEX-MOBILHY). The simulated net radiation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture content \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12199343930482121391", "cites_id": ["12199343930482121391"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169495030069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r1o0favGTKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 6, "2000": 4, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 7, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
