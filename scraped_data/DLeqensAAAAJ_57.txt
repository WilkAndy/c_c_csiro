The Budyko framework has recently seen a renaissance in hydrological research due to the framework\u2019s comprehensiveness and effectiveness for studying the effects of global change on water resources. In this paper, the development of the Budyko framework is analysed first. The temporal and spatial variability for the Budyko hypothesis are subsequently elaborated. On finer temporal scales, more processes need to be considered, and the degree of control exerted by individual factors on the water balance varies with the spatial scale considered. Finally, perspectives regarding better understanding and application of the Budyko framework at the catchment scale are provided. A representative and diverse catchment data set is required to estimate the parameter in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5443917824256", "cites_id": ["5443917824256"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0309133315620997", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AMHJgvMEAAAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 13, "2020": 22, "2021": 20, "2022": 27, "2023": 8}}
