The downward approach is seen as a necessary counterpoint to the mechanistic \u2018reductionist\u2019 approach that dominates current hydrological model development. It provides a systematic framework to learning from data, including the testing of hypotheses at every step of analysis. It can also be applied in a hierarchical manner: starting from exploring first\u2010order controls in the modelling of catchment response, the model complexity can then be increased in response to deficiencies in reproducing observations at different levels. The remaining contributions of this special issue present a number of applications of the downward approach, including development of parsimonious water balance models with changing time scales by learning from signatures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 503, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12446555243504992777", "cites_id": ["12446555243504992777"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.1425", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CQJkngwMu6wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 12, "2005": 15, "2006": 32, "2007": 16, "2008": 19, "2009": 22, "2010": 25, "2011": 38, "2012": 24, "2013": 24, "2014": 30, "2015": 37, "2016": 32, "2017": 21, "2018": 43, "2019": 33, "2020": 21, "2021": 24, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
