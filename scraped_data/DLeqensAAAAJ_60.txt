Models for mean annual evapotranspiration have been developed to quantify catchment scale differences in mean annual evapotranspiration. Zhang et al. (2001) developed a simple, one parameter, model for the relationships between evapotranspiration and vegetation cover by evaluating the differences of model parameter values for different vegetation covers. However, other factors such as climate and catchment topography may also affect evapotranspiration and therefore the model parameter. Simple models acknowledging only categorical vegetation cover (forested, mixed, and grassed) may introduce some uncertainty, and more seriously, lead to inconsistent conclusions regarding relationships between vegetation cover and evapotranspiration.
