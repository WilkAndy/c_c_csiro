ET0 maps are useful for regional agricultural and water resources management, and also play an important role in the distributed hydrological modeling. For generating spatial ET0 surfaces, \u2018Interpolate-then-calculate (IC)\u2019 approach is powerful in principle and is recommended especially for sparse weather station networks. The partial thin-plate smoothing spline incorporated in ANUSPLIN for interpolating climatic variables has been accepted widely across the world. In this paper, the climatology monthly ET0 data of Shiyang river basin, one of the three inner basins in northwest China, are developed by spatially modeling the input climatic parameters with ANUSPLIN, and from the interpolated climate and ET0 datasets, sensitivity coefficients of ET0 to the climatic variables of selected months are also spatially distributed.
