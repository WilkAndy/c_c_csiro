Compared with other drought aspects, the recovery of drought especially in the hydrological components, which directly relates to the recovery of water resources for agricultural, ecological and human needs, is less\u2010understood. Here, taking the Millennium drought in southeast Australia (\u223c1997\u20132009) as an illustrating case, we comprehensively examined multiple aspects of the meteorological (i.e., precipitation) and hydrological (i.e., streamflow and base flow) droughts across 130 unimpaired catchments using long\u2010term hydro\u2010meteorological observations. Results show that the duration and intensity of the meteorological drought are both lengthened and amplified in the hydrological drought, suggesting a nonstationarity in the rainfall\u2010runoff relationship \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17009563291693509846", "cites_id": ["17009563291693509846"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017WR020683", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1mzqebEbDuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 9, "2019": 16, "2020": 20, "2021": 25, "2022": 19, "2023": 13}}
