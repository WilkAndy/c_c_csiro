By analyzing temporal variations in reference evapotranspiration (ET0), improved understanding of the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes can be obtained. In this study, variations in ET0 over 58 years (1950\u20132007) at 34 stations in the Haihe river basin of China were analyzed. ET0 was calculated by the FAO Penman\u2013Monteith formula. Calculation of Kendall rank coefficient was done by analyzing the annual and seasonal trends in ET0 derived from its dependent climate variables. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) was used to analyze the spatial variation in annual and seasonal ET0, and in each climate variable. An attribution analysis was performed to quantify the contribution of each input variable to ET0 variation.
