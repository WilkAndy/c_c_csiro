The model uses consumption curves to partition water to a number of components according to supply and demand and to represent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of catchment processes in a parsimonious formulation. The Wapaba model was benchmarked against the well known abcd monthly water balance model as well as the original monthly Budyko framework model and found to outperform both on the Australian catchments. The Wapaba model was also compared with two daily water balance models widely used in Australia. It had validation performance comparable to or better than the daily water balance models in simulating monthly runoff on the Australian catchments. This indicates that the monthly model has not been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15301314254900482203", "cites_id": ["15301314254900482203"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411002794", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m9D2tz4wWdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 10, "2022": 16, "2023": 5}}
