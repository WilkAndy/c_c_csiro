During the \u223cdecade\u2010long Millennium drought in south\u2010eastern Australia significant shifts in hydrologic behavior were reported. Catchment rainfall\u2010runoff partitioning changed from what was previously encountered during shorter droughts, with significantly less runoff than expected occurring in many catchments. In this article, we investigate the variability in the magnitude of shift in rainfall\u2010runoff partitioning observed during the Millennium drought. We re\u2010evaluate a large range of factors suggested to be responsible for the additional runoff reductions. Our results suggest that the shifts were mostly influenced by catchment characteristics related to predrought climate (aridity index and rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15633906719107178493", "cites_id": ["15633906719107178493"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016WR019525", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_d_5O1TL9tgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 10, "2018": 9, "2019": 11, "2020": 18, "2021": 20, "2022": 17, "2023": 12}}
