It is important to assess the subsequent impact on streamflow and its spatial distribution in the region. The water balance model of et al.(2001) Zhang et al.(2001) was used in this study, and the results showed that the model was able to accurately simulate average annual evapotranspiration (ET), but not average annual streamflow when compared with streamflow measurements from 38 hydrologic stations in the coarse sandy hilly catchments (CSHC) in the Loess Plateau. The model was then calibrated using the measured streamflow, and the index of agreement increased from 0\u00b7 21 to 0\u00b7 63, the relative error and root mean square error decreased from 42\u00b7 7 and 17\u00b7 2 to 18\u00b7 0% and 7\u00b7 9 mm, respectively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14683717266458211684", "cites_id": ["14683717266458211684"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6784", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZPWCYQ4Lx8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
