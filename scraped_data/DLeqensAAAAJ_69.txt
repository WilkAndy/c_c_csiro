The transfer of sensible and latent heat is described by an aerodynamic resistance and a surface resistance. The aerodynamic resistance is formulated on the basis of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and the surface resistance is determined from the energy balance equation using remotely sensed surface temperature. The regional evapotranspiration is then calculated with a one-layer resistance model. The overall surface transfer characteristics at regional scale are characterized by an effective roughness length and this parameter was determined from local roughness length with the aid of remote sensing measurements. The model was validated by using the data obtained during the HAPEX-MOBILHY (Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment and Modelisation du Bilan Hydrique) experiment.
