The degree of control exerted by these factors varies with the spatial and temporal scales of processes modeled. The Budyko framework or the \u201climits\u201d concept was used to model water balance at four temporal scales (mean annual, annual, monthly and daily). The method represents a top-down approach to hydrologic modeling and is expected to achieve parsimony of model parameters. Daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and streamflow from 265 catchments in Australia were used. On a mean annual basis, the index of dryness defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation was confirmed to be a dominant factor in determining the water balance with one model parameter. Analysis of the data, however, suggested increased model complexity is necessary on finer time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 456, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5529214214541098539", "cites_id": ["5529214214541098539"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169408003582", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Kz7DeAi3u0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 16, "2011": 21, "2012": 19, "2013": 26, "2014": 26, "2015": 38, "2016": 38, "2017": 32, "2018": 43, "2019": 28, "2020": 51, "2021": 46, "2022": 47, "2023": 14}}
