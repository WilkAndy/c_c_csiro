A quantitative means of describing root water uptake should be established for efficient water use. The objectives of this research are to develop a two-dimensional (2D) model of root water uptake for single apple trees and to validate the model with sap flow and soil water content measurements in an orchard. Tube-time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to measure soil volumetric water content, and sap flow sensors based on heat-pulse technology were used to monitor locally the rates of sap flow in the trunk of the apple tree. Also leaf area index (LAI) was measured using the Hemiview system, root density distribution was determined and soil hydraulic characteristics parameters were fitted from measurements. A 2D model of root water uptake was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6432053749983310380", "cites_id": ["6432053749983310380"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377405003537", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LHL5n84-Q1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
