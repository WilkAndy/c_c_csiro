The effectiveness of these soil conservation measures (which were also coincident with reduced rainfall and streamflow) in controlling sediment movement remains to be ascertained. Here the association between sediment movement, hydrological variability, and the implementation of soil conservation measures is examined for the Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments region of the Yellow River basin. The hypothesis that the soil conservation measures have reduced suspended sediment yields beyond that associated with rainfall reductions alone, principally by reducing sediment concentration, is examined. Annual sediment yield decreased significantly over time in all subcatchments, and the timing of the change (between 1971 and 1985) was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17476020485236490265", "cites_id": ["17476020485236490265"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007WR006656", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GYD4FQpMh_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
