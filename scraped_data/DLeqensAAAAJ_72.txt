The physiological control on transpiration is formulated using canopy resistance defined as a function of the net assimilation rate, the relative humidity and CO2 concentration at the leaf surface. Rainfall infiltration, runoff and redistribution are simulated with the Richards equation and evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Two innovative features of the model are (1) coupling of the vegetation-atmosphere system by changing the value of the vapour pressure deficit of air in the canopy, and (2) the plant carbon balance, which allows the simulation of plant growth using a saturation rate kinetics formulation. The model was validated using evapotranspiration, soil moisture and leaf \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8744797152879930519", "cites_id": ["8744797152879930519"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169496030727", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l2xBuq3CW3kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 9, "2000": 4, "2001": 9, "2002": 9, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 10, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
