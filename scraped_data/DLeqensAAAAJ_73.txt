The main objective of TOPOG_IRM is to provide a realistic description of the key processes which control the soil moisture dynamics, evapotranspiration, and to investigate hydrological and ecological responses at a catchment scale. The model was not fitted but parameterised with field data and literature values. The soil moisture content at various depths was well simulated for six sites in the catchment representing different soil types and landscape positions. The spatial patterns of the soil moisture content appear to be controlled mainly by the soil types, and the results indicated that there is little lateral movement of water in the catchment. Average groundwater recharge was found to be 5% of the annual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1499633824157046887", "cites_id": ["1499633824157046887"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98WR01616", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z5gKhgTFzxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 10, "2004": 2, "2005": 9, "2006": 8, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 0, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 8, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
