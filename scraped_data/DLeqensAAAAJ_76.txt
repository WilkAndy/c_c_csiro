The purpose of this study was to develop a method for mapping spatial distribution of crop evapotranspiration and analyze the temporal and spatial variation of spring wheat evapotranspiration in the Shiyang river basin in Northwest China in the last 50 years. DEM-based methods were employed to estimate the spatial distribution of spring wheat evapotranspiration (ETc). Reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) was calculated with the Penman\u2013Monteith equation using meteorological data measured from eight stations in the basin. Crop coefficient (Kc) was determined from measured evapotranspiration in spring wheat season in the region. The results showed that ETc gradually increased in the upper reaches of the basin in the last 50 years, while the middle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2103790310877962939", "cites_id": ["2103790310877962939"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377406002150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uyLKMSQqMh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 13, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
