Here we review the current state of knowledge regarding soil moisture\u2013plant interactions and the ecohydrological effects of soil moisture dynamics. Approaches for investigating soil moisture\u2013plant interactions are also reviewed, with emphasis on their ability to predict plant/ecosystem responses to soil moisture variations under environment change.The status and distribution of soil moisture affect ecohydrological processes such as runoff, infiltration and evaporation and plant morphology and function (e.g. transpiration and photosynthetic rate). Plants also affect soil moisture dynamics through its involvement in the water cycle.
