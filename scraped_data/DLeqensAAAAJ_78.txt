However, the capacity of these models to extrapolate under changing climatic conditions is questionable. A number of studies have found that model predictive skill decreases with changed climatic conditions, especially when predicting drier climates. We found that model skill only declines under certain circumstances, in particular, when a catchment's rainfall\u2010runoff processes change due to changed climatic drivers. In catchments where the rainfall\u2010runoff relationship changed significantly in response to prolonged dry conditions, runoff was consistently overestimated. In contrast, modeled runoff was unbiased in catchments where the rainfall\u2010runoff relationship remained unchanged during the dry period. These conclusions were not model dependent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1756878204477320502", "cites_id": ["1756878204477320502"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067326", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ni1_K2uvYRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 19, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
