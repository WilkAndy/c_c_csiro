Evapotranspiration in the non\u2010rainfall period was estimated using two approaches: the soil water balance method based on tube\u2010type time\u2010domain reflection measurements, and sap flow plus micro\u2010lysimeter methods. The two methods were in good agreement, with differences usually less than 10%. The components of evapotranspiration varied with canopy development. During spring and autumn, soil evaporation was dominating as result of low leaf area index. In summer, plant transpiration became significant, with an average transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio of 0\u00b787. The crop coefficient Kc showed a strong linear dependence on leaf area index. The water stress coefficient Ks was around 1\u00b70 when soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9786734313138314813", "cites_id": ["9786734313138314813"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.6284", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PV68ZQF30YcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
