The aerodynamic resistance was determined by non-dimensional groups. Three relationships for estimating the aerodynamic resistance were compared. The aerodynamic resistance in a cooler-than-air situation was found larger than that in a warmer-than-air situation owing to downward mixing of warmer, lighter air.The calculated sensible heat fluxes were compared with energy balance estimates. The resistance form equation for sensible heat flux and the Penman-Monteith equation are sensitive to the errors in aerodynamic resistance, but these errors have much less effect on latent heat flux estimates from the energy balance equation.Estimates of evapotranspiration from both the energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6690966592745783210", "cites_id": ["6690966592745783210"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168192392900629", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qj-edKoW21wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
