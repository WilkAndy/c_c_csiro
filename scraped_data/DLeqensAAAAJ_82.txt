Unfortunately, reliable estimates are extremely difficult to obtain, especially in arid regions. In this research, three evapotranspiration models are evaluated, namely, the Advection-Aridity, the Complementary Relationship Areal Evapotranspiration (CRAE), and the Penman-Monteith models. By applying these models to an arid river basin in Xinjiang, China, the consistency and reliability of the models are examined. It is found that the Penman-Monteith model is particularly sensitive to the canopy resistance rc, but is not sensitive to the surface albedo. In arid regions canopy resistance may range from 400 to 1000 sm\u22121 for crops and grassland and a 10% error in rc results in a 10% error in the estimated evapotranspiration. The use of the surface roughness length and surface albedo have significant effects on the estimates of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13210713943437231799", "cites_id": ["13210713943437231799"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169490900678", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t0bgk1biVbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 6, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
