A new method was developed to estimate the seasonality effect on catchment-scale mean annual water balance using a top-down approach. The model is based on observed rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and streamflow data from 326 unregulated catchments in Australia. It assumes that catchment-scale annual evapotranspiration consists of two components: climate-controlled evapotranspiration and storage-controlled evapotranspiration. The distinction made here is to allow the effects of climate and catchment storage to be estimated separately. The climate-controlled evapotranspiration is affected by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and can be accurately estimated by Budyko-type relationships using dryness index for different rainfall regimes. The storage-controlled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14482966254501513512", "cites_id": ["14482966254501513512"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169406002976", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KEmIDRPV_cgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
