There have been numerous studies before and since the launch of the predictions in ungauged basins (PUB) initiative by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences in 2003. This study critically reviews and assesses the decadal progress in the regionalization of hydrological modeling, which is the major tool for PUB, from 2000 to 2019. This paper found that the journal publications have noticeably increased in terms of PUB in the past 7\u2009years, and research countries have been expanded dramatically since 2013. The regionalization methods are grouped into three categories including similarity\u2010based, regression\u2010based, and hydrological signature\u2010based. There are more detailed researches focusing on the interdisciplinary and profound improvement of each regionalization method \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5856755077841328745", "cites_id": ["5856755077841328745"], "pub_url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wat2.1487", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aZoyf7ZfR1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 21, "2022": 41, "2023": 16}}
