Accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ET) under the film-mulching condition is critical for optimizing crop water management. After taking the mulching effect on soil evaporation (Es) into account, our study adjusted the original Shuttleworth\u2013Wallace model (MSW) in estimating maize ET and Es under the film-mulching condition. Maize ET and Es respectively measured by eddy covariance and micro-lysimeter methods during 2007 and 2008 were used to validate the performance of the Penman\u2013Monteith (PM), the original Shuttleworth\u2013Wallace (SW) and the MSW models in arid northwest China. Results indicate that all three models significantly overestimated ET during the initial crop stage in the both years, which may be due to the underestimation of canopy resistance induced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7128553848465980030", "cites_id": ["7128553848465980030"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216941300560X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fvoO3PS17WIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 17, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
