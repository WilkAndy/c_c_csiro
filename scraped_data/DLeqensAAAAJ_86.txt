While plantations can present significant environmental benefits such as salinity and erosion controls, their impact on streamflow needs to be recognized. This study evaluated the impacts of plantation and climate variability on streamflow from catchments in Australia. In total 15 catchments were selected based on the availability of streamflow, meteorological, and plantation information. The catchment areas range from 0.6 to 1136 km2 and represent different climatic conditions and management practices. The Mann\u2013Kendall test was used to estimate trends in the annual streamflow, rainfall, potential evaporation, and runoff ratio. The plantation effect on streamflow was determined with the time\u2010trend analysis method, while the effect of climate variability was calculated using the sensitivity\u2010based approach. All the selected catchments showed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3083693626991880519", "cites_id": ["3083693626991880519"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011wr010711", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R6n8AAR7yyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
