It can reduce irrigation water and transpiration without reduction in crop yield, thus increase water and nutrient use efficiency. Understanding of soil moisture distribution and dynamic under the alternate partial root zone drip irrigation (APDI) can help to develop the efficient irrigation schemes. In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) root water uptake model was proposed based on soil water dynamic and root distribution of grape vine, and a function of soil evaporation related to soil water content was defined under the APDI. Then the soil water dynamic model of APDI (APRI-model) was developed based on the 2D root water uptake model and soil evaporation function combined with average measured soil moisture content at 0\u201310 cm soil layer. Soil water dynamic in APDI was respectively simulated by Hydrus-2D model and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17914725952168209244", "cites_id": ["17914725952168209244"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-006-9187-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XCt1U1bknfgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
