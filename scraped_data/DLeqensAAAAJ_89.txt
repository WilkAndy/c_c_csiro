In the study, we developed a coupled surface resistance model (CO) after taking the combined restriction effect of vegetation and soil layers on ET into account. The CO model was compared with the modified Shuttleworth\u2013Wallace model (MSW), and the traditional Jarvis, Katerji and Perrier, Irmak and Mutiibwa, Stannard, Leuning, Shuttleworth and Gurney, Massman, Garcia-Santos, Ortega-Farias, and Todorovic canopy resistance models over the partial and dense canopy stages. Maize and vineyard ET measured by the eddy covariance method during 2007\u20132013 were used to examine the model performance. Results indicate that the PM equation combined with the coupled surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=982170515178957286", "cites_id": ["982170515178957286"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192315001069", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5qkaOuFeoQ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
