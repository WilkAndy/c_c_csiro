These measures have resulted in large\u2010scale land use and land cover change. It is important to evaluate the impacts of these soil conservation measures on streamflow as streamflow is an important determinant on catchment sediment yield and obviously is related to water security in the region. In this study, data from 11 catchments in the Loess Plateau were analyzed to investigate the responses of streamflow to the land use/cover changes. The nonparametric Mann\u2010Kendall test and the Pettitt test were used to identify trends and change points in the streamflow records. All 11 catchments had significant negative trend in annual streamflow of \u22120.13 to \u22121.58 mm a\u22121.
