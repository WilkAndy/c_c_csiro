This paper illustrates how a land use change model can be linked to the Integrated Quantity and Quality Model (IQQM) for the Murrumbidgee River system in southeastern Australia. Linking the two models allows the impact of potential plantation expansion to be assessed at various points throughout the river system and allows changes in streamflow in upland areas to be converted into impacts on allocations and diversion for downstream water users. To derive an envelope of responses, two plausible plantation expansion scenarios are considered. These are the planting of 30,000ha in areas that will have the largest reduction in mean annual water yield, and the planting of 30,000ha in areas that will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18423781879235651234", "cites_id": ["18423781879235651234"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112707004690", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oqYeewFsrv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 12, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
