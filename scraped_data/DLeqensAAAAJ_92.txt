This study was conducted to assess whether changes in management practices have increased regional Ag WUE for a focus area covering 20% of the 300 000 km2 North China Plain (NCP). An \u2018input\u2013output\u2019 definition of regional Ag WUE was used, where \u2018input\u2019 is the water available over the crop growing season and \u2018output\u2019 is grain yield. Regional databases of precipitation, irrigation, and yield from 1984 to 1996 were established in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to calculate winter wheat and summer corn Ag WUE on a county basis. For wheat, the average Ag WUE was 7.0 kg/ha.mm in 1984, whereas in 1996 it was 14.3 kg/ha.mm. For corn, Ag WUE \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10000957848153361385", "cites_id": ["10000957848153361385"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/AR00170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6QvW8CyKyooJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 7, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 10, "2011": 8, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
