The results show that both the 14 LSMs and six Budyko-type models can explain 55\u201370% of the spatial variations of mean annual runoff across the selected 150 basins. However, the 14 LSMs show larger biases in the simulated mean annual runoff than the Budyko-type models. The LSMs biases are caused by errors in forcing data, model structure and model parameterisation. The errors in the precipitation forcing data are found to be the main cause for biases in the simulated mean annual runoffs by the Budyko-types models, and most likely for biases in the 14 global land surface models too.
