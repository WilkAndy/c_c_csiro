This paucity of progress in model development is (in part) due to the difficulty of distinguishing which cases of model failure are truly caused by structural inadequacy. Here we propose a new framework to diagnose the salient cause of poor model performance in changing climate conditions, be it structural inadequacy, poor parameterization, or data errors. The framework can be applied to a single catchment, although larger samples of catchments are helpful to generalize and/or cross\u2010check results. To generate a diagnosis, multiple historic periods with contrasting climate are defined, and the limits of model robustness and flexibility are explored over each period \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16753332713363313594", "cites_id": ["16753332713363313594"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018WR023989", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:upPz_1bLf-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 21, "2021": 12, "2022": 18, "2023": 10}}
