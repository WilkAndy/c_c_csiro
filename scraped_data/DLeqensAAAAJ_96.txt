The SWI requires three parameters\u2014precipitation, potential evaporation, and parameter   of a Budyko\u2010type formula. Based on different types of   (fixed or dynamic), SWI can be used to estimate the dryness/wetness resulting from climate change (variability) solely, and from the joint effects of climate and land surface change (variability). Performance of SWI is evaluated using historical droughts and by comparing to the self\u2010calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index. Results show that SWI effectively captures global droughts. Furthermore, a case study in two catchments with significant land surface modification \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18210713246204207361", "cites_id": ["18210713246204207361"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016wr020178", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AaGAgjZzufwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 9, "2019": 16, "2020": 6, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
