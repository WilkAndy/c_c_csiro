Shiyang is the largest basin in terms of human population density and has the highest exploitation of water resources in the northwest. Serious water shortages constrain social and  economic development, and the area has some of the worst ecological and environmental deterioration in China. From historical data and recent observations, we have analysed changes in water systems in the Minqin oasis, at the end of the river basin, and assessed impacts and consequences of  a changing climate and intensive human activity. Historically, climate change has been the main cause of changes in the oasis. In the last 50 years, however, a major influence has been intense human activity in the basin. With increasing population (159% in 50 years), the amount of cultivated  land has been greatly expanded (by 51 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14172474944164127886", "cites_id": ["14172474944164127886"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3843/SusDev.15.5:5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:juQGa9--rsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
