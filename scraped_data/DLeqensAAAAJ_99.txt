As a result, various agronomic practices have been proposed to reduce groundwater recharge. This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of these practices on recharge, in particular episodic recharge. A biophysically based model (WAVES) was used to estimate recharge rates under some typical crop and pasture rotations in the region using long-term meteorological data. Results show that: (1) recharge just below the root zone was episodic and that just 10% of annual recharge events contributed over 85% of long-term totals. Management options such as incorporating lucerne and deep-rooted non-fallow rotations can reduce both, mean annual recharge, and the number of episodic events, but not eliminate recharge completely; (2) winter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DLeqensAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8106618264522358577", "cites_id": ["8106618264522358577"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377499000347", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MX-MYlx-gHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
