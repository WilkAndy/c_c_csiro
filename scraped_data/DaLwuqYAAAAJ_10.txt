Hippocampal volume was measured and PIB standardized uptake value ratio was extracted after partial volume correction within 41 regions of interest. Global, regional, and voxel-based correlations between PIB and hippocampal volume were computed for each group.Results: In healthy control participants with elevated neocortex PIB retention, significant correlation was found between PIB retention in the inferior temporal region and hippocampal volume using both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 257, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10326725690066737788", "cites_id": ["10326725690066737788"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/74/2/121.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fBpUQU3mT48J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 16, "2011": 30, "2012": 26, "2013": 34, "2014": 25, "2015": 21, "2016": 15, "2017": 23, "2018": 20, "2019": 15, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
