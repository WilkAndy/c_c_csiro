As $^{11}\\textnormal{C}$ PiB PET images have limited anatomical information, an Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) is usually acquired to perform the spatial normalization needed for population analysis. We designed and evaluated a high dimensional spatial normalization approach that only uses the $^{11}\\textnormal{C}$ PiB PET image. The non-rigid registration (NRR) is based on free form deformation (FFD) modelled using B-splines. To compensate for the limited anatomical information, the FFD is constrained to an allowable transform space using a model trained from MR registrations. A\u03b2 deposition is dependent on disease staging, so a spatially normalized $^{11}\\textnormal{C}$ PiB PET appearance model selects and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9813236409508042769", "cites_id": ["9813236409508042769"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85988-8_53", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ERiojYWeL4gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
