Performing accurate analysis for population studies is challenging because of the interindividual anatomical variability. A large set of tools is found to perform studies of brain anatomy and population analysis (FreeSurfer, SPM, FSL). In this paper we present a newly developed surface-based processing pipeline (MILXCTE) that allows accurate vertex-wise statistical comparisons of brain modifications, such as cortical thickness (CTE). The brain is first segmented into the three main tissues: white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid, after CTE is computed, a topology corrected mesh is generated. Partial inflation and non-rigid registration of cortical surfaces to a common space using shape context are then performed.
