Here, we demonstrate that scalloping is principally due to the noise reduction filtering that occurs when image samples are interpolated. Typically at a much smaller scale (100 times less in our test cases), there are also fluctuations in the similarity objective function due to interpolation of the signal and to sampling of a continuous, band-limited image signal. Focusing on the larger problem from noise, we show that this phenomenon can even bias global maxima, giving inaccurate registrations. This phenomenon is readily seen when one registers an image onto itself with different noise realizations but is absent when the same noise realization is present in both images. For linear interpolation, local maxima and global bias are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1075251556740143291", "cites_id": ["1075251556740143291"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841506000958", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u5iuC5gP7A4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
