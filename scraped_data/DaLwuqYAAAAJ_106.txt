We aim to accurately identify plaque tissue types from fresh cadaver specimens rapidly (less than 5 h) in three dimensions for large specimens (up to 4 cm vessel segments). A single\u2010blind validation study was designed to determine sensitivity, specificity and inter\u2010rater agreement (Fleiss' Kappa) of cryo\u2010imaging tissue types with histology as the gold standard. Six na\u00efve human raters identified 344 tissue type samples in 36 cryo\u2010image sets after being trained. Tissue type sensitivities are as follows: greater than 90% for adventitia, media\u2010related, smooth muscle cell ingrowth, external elastic lamina, internal elastic lamina, fibrosis, dense calcification and haemorrhage; greater than 80% for lipid and light calcification; and greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12996450617138690008", "cites_id": ["12996450617138690008"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2008.02138.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2Dd1Z_qqXLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
