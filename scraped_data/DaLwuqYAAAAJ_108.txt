Application especially to the twin-roll continuous casting of thin steel strip."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16915258448343369421", "cites_id": ["16915258448343369421"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US5706882A/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zYZuGfARv-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1}}
