Although commonly observed in elderly individuals, they are more prevalent in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients. Given that WMH appear relatively homogeneous on FLAIR, they are commonly partitioned into location- or distance-based classes when investigating their relevance to disease. Since pathology indicates that such lesions are often heterogeneous, probing their microstructure in vivo may provide greater insight than relying on such arbitrary classification schemes. In this study, we investigated WMH in vivo using an advanced diffusion MRI method known as single-shell 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution (SS3T-CSD), which models white matter microstructure while accounting for grey matter and CSF compartments.
