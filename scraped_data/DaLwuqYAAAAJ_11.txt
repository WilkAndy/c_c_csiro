Using diffusion-weighted imaging, Spherical Deconvolution enables multiple fibre populations within a voxel to be resolved by computing the fibre orientation distribution (FOD). In this paper, we present a novel method that employs FODs for the registration of diffusion-weighted images. Registration was performed by optimising a symmetric diffeomorphic non-linear transformation model, using image metrics based on the mean squared difference, and cross-correlation of the FOD spherical harmonic coefficients. The proposed method was validated by recovering known displacement fields using FODs represented with maximum harmonic degrees (lmax) of 2, 4 and 6. Results demonstrate a benefit in using FODs at lmax=4 compared to lmax=2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 234, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12171391480549078636", "cites_id": ["12171391480549078636"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911001534", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bPZXlBB46agJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 17, "2019": 19, "2020": 34, "2021": 38, "2022": 43, "2023": 13}}
