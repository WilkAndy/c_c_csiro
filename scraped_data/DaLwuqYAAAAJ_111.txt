While elevated amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition (A\u03b2+) has been associated with increased cortical atrophy, it remains unknown whether \u201cSuperAgers\u201d may be protected from A\u03b2\u2010associated neurodegeneration.Neuropsychologically defined SuperAgers (n = 172) and cognitively normal for age (n = 172) older adults from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study were case matched. Rates of cortical atrophy over 8 years were examined by SuperAger classification and A\u03b2 status.Of the case\u2010matched SuperAgers and cognitively normal for age older adults, 40.7% and 40.1%, respectively, were A\u03b2+. Rates of age\u2010 and A\u03b2\u2010associated atrophy did not differ between the groups on any measure. A\u03b2\u2212 individuals displayed the slowest rates of atrophy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:5aszrCQfcYQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7070963938663922372", "cites_id": ["7070963938663922372"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.dadm.2019.05.005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xPqoFz0cIWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 8}}
