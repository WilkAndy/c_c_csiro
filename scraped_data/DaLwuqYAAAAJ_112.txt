Analyses of covariance evaluated associations between A\u03b2, APOE and BDNF genotype, and cortisol in relation to severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.Among A\u03b2+ older adults, APOE \u03b54 carriage was associated with greater severity of anxiety symptoms (d\u2009=\u20090.55); and in the full sample, APOE \u03b54 carriage was linked to greater severity of depressive (d\u2009=\u20090.26) and anxiety (d\u2009=\u20090.21) symptoms. Among A\u03b2+ women, \u03b54 carriers reported greater anxiety symptoms than non-\u03b54 carriers (d\u2009=\u20090.83), and female BDNF rs6265 Val66 Met allele carriers reported greater depressive symptoms (d\u2009=\u20090.29 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:6DS7WFnF4J4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2015838505553675962", "cites_id": ["2015838505553675962"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748116302093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:usYUwHCy-RsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
