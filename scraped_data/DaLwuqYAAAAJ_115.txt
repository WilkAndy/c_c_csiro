We implemented a stereospecific approach to generate both continuous and categorical measures that reflect tau spreading and deposition in order to make results from tau imaging studies clinically relevant and easy to interpret. Methods: Sixty-three participants underwent tau and A\u03b2 imaging with 18F-AV1451 and 18F-florbetapir (53-HC and 10-AD), while 27 received 18F-THK5317 and 18F-flutemetamol (22-HC and 5-AD). Three regional tau-masks were constructed: Mesial-temporal (Me) comprising entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus and amygdala; Temporoparietal (Te) comprising inferior temporal, fusiform, supramarginal and angular gyri, posterior cingulate/precuneus, superior and inferior parietal, and lateral occipital; and rest of neocortex (R) comprising dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, gyrus rectus, superior and middle temporal, and anterior cingulate. A neocortical tau burden was determined by averaging Te and R. Thresholds were established for each region and tracer. Z-scores were generated for each tracer to allow combination of the results. As continuous variable, a region was deemed high tau when above the 90% ile of the HC. Categorically, a study was deemed high tau when 2 of 3 regions showed high tracer retention.
