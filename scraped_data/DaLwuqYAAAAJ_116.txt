Reliable automatic extraction of WMH biomarkers is challenging, primarily due to their heterogeneous spatial occurrence, their small size and their diffuse nature. In this paper, we present an automatic and accurate method to segment these lesions that is based on the use of neural networks and an overcomplete strategy. The proposed method was compared to other related methods showing competitive and reliable results in two different neurodegenerative datasets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:yxAilOxaV9sC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10871674578636588796", "cites_id": ["10871674578636588796"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47118-1_12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_EZHvW3y35YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
