However, reliable biological correlates of poststroke depression and functional outcome have not been well established in humans.Our aim is to identify biological factors, molecular and imaging, associated with poststroke depression and recovery that may be used to guide more targeted interventions.In a longitudinal cohort study of 200 stroke survivors, the START \u2013 STroke imAging pRevention and Treatment cohort, we will examine the relationship between gene expression, regulator proteins, depression, and functional outcome. Stroke survivors will be investigated at baseline, 24 h, three-days, three-months, and 12 months poststroke for blood-based biological associates and at days 3\u20137, three-months, and 12 months for depression and functional outcomes.
