We aimed to determine the prognostic value of \u03b2\u2010amyloid imaging, alone and in combination with memory performance, hippocampal atrophy, and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status in nondemented, older individuals.A total of 183 healthy individuals (age = 72.0 \u00b1 7.26 years) and 87 participants with MCI (age = 73.7 \u00b1 8.27) in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study of ageing were studied. Clinical reclassification was performed after 3 years, blind to biomarker findings. \u03b2\u2010Amyloid imaging was considered positive if the 11C\u2010Pittsburgh compound B cortical to reference ratio was \u22651.5.Thirteen percent of healthy persons progressed (15 to MCI, 8 to dementia), and 59% of the MCI \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 225, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5881178756401458314", "cites_id": ["5881178756401458314"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.24040", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iuzhS-sknlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 12, "2015": 25, "2016": 22, "2017": 22, "2018": 34, "2019": 34, "2020": 21, "2021": 26, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
