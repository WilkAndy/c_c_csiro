This inconsistency is particularly evident when PRSs are assessed independent of APOE genotype. As such, the development and assessment of phenotype-specific weightings to derive PRSs for cognitive decline in preclinical AD is warranted. To this end a episodic memory-weighted PRS (emPRS) was derived and assessed against decline in cognitive performance in 226 healthy cognitively normal older adults with high brain A\u03b2-amyloid burden participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. The effect size for decline in a verbal episodic memory was determined individually for 27 genetic variants in a reference sample (n = 151). These were then summed to generate a emPRS either including APOE (emPRSAPOE) or excluding APOE (emPRSAPOE). Resultant emPRS were then evaluated, in a test sample (n = 75), against decline in global cognition, verbal episodic memory and a pre-Alzheimer\u2019s cognitive composite (AIBL-PACC) over 7.5 years. The mean (SD) age of the 226 participants was 72.2 (6.6) years and 116 (51.3%) were female. Reference and test samples did not differ significantly demographically. Whilst no association of emPRSs were observed with baseline cognition, the emPRSAPOE was associated with longitudinal global cognition (-0.237, P = 0.0002), verbal episodic memory (-0.259, P = 0.00003) and the AIBL-PACC (-0.381, P = 0.02). The emPRSAPOE was also associated with global cognition (-0.169, P = 0.021) and verbal episodic memory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:QlYoQ0azr6kC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1572302655775322466", "cites_id": ["1572302655775322466"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00423/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YjHkXO_w0RUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
