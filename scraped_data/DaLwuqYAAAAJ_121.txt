Participants were characterized according to their status on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. A total of 308 individuals who were CDR 0 and had low cerebral A\u03b2 levels (A\u03b2\u2212), 32 individuals who were A\u03b2\u2212 and CDR 0.5, and 43 individuals who were A\u03b2+ and CDR 0.5 were included in this study. Participants completed the CogState brief battery at baseline, and at 18-, 36-, 54- and 72-month follow-up. Linear mixed model analyses indicated that relative to the A\u03b2\u2212 CDR 0 group, the A\u03b2+ CDR 0.5 group showed increased rates of memory decline and hippocampal volume loss. However, compared to the A\u03b2\u2212 CDR 0 group, the A\u03b2\u2212 CDR 0.5 group showed no changes in cognitive function \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:vq25oHwZT-8C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4000217962484820962", "cites_id": ["4000217962484820962"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12031-016-0822-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4msL9gqhgzcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
