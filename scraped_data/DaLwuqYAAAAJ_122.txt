Minimal data are available for objective analysis of these images. The aim of this study was to determine if greyscale texture analysis could differentiate between benign and malignant lung lesions.Digital EBUS\u2010MP images with a gain setting of 10/19 and contrast setting of 4/8 from 2007 until 2012 inclusive were included. These images had an expert\u2010defined region of interest (ROI) mapped. ROI were analysed for the following greyscale texture features: mean pixel value, difference between maximum and minimum pixel value, standard deviation of the mean pixel value, entropy, correlation, energy and homogeneity. Significant greyscale texture features differentiating benign from malignant disease were used by two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:n5u26LFhhPsC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6064354067464979958", "cites_id": ["6064354067464979958"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/resp.12577", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9gVy3-TpKFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
