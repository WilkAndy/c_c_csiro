For clinical use, there is a great need for PET-only quantification method, as MR images are not always available. In this paper, we validate a previously developed PET-only quantification method against MR-based quantification using 6 tracers: 18F-Florbetaben (N=148), 18F-Florbetapir (N=171), 18F-NAV4694 (N=47), 18F-Flutemetamol (N=180), 11C-PiB (N=381) and 18F-FDG (N=34). The results show an overall mean absolute percentage error of less than 5% for each tracer. The method has been implemented as a remote service called CapAIBL (http://milxcloud.csiro.au/capaibl). PET images are uploaded to a cloud platform where they are spatially normalised to a standard template and quantified.
