Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we defined cognitive reserve using the residual reserve index: episodic memory performance residualized for 3T MRI-derived brain volumes and demographics. We examined whether cognitive reserve predicted executive function (EF) decline equally across 2 groups of older adults\u2014AD biomarker\u2013positive (n = 468) and \u2013negative (n = 402)\u2014defined by the tau-to-amyloid ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. A significant interaction between the residual reserve index and biomarker group revealed that the effect of cognitive reserve on EF decline was dependent on pathology status. In the biomarker-positive group, higher cognitive reserve predicted EF decline over five years \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:noJvBAPgP0YC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=335854242513829321", "cites_id": ["335854242513829321"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458019304518", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yT1YdacxqQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
