These levels are often combined with levels of an additional non-A marker to increase predictive accuracy. Recent efforts to overcome the invasive nature of CSF collection led to the observation of A species within the blood cellular fraction, however, little is known of what additional biomarkers may be found in this membranous fraction. The current study aimed to undertake a discovery-based proteomic investigation of the blood cellular fraction from AD patients (n= 18) and healthy controls (HC; n= 15) using copper immobilized metal affinity capture and Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Three candidate biomarkers were observed which could differentiate AD patients from HC (ROC AUC> 0.8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7240164845140095015", "cites_id": ["7240164845140095015"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad101722", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J7DYDZE7emQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
