Diagnosis and staging of atherosclerosis is a challenge, especially with regards to the identification of plaque vulnerability. We are developing imaging methods based upon MRI and intravascular microcoils. In order to rigorously validate our MRI imaging methods and algorithms, we have developed a new cryo-imaging system that allows one to alternately section and image the block face of tissue. We obtain 3D pathology of vessel segments excised from cadaver and we characterize the tissues of atheroma using episcopic autofluorescence and bright field microscopy images. After embedding the vessel, the block is frozen, and block face microscopic images are taken every 200\u03bcm with an image resolution of 30\u03bcm\u00d730\u03bcm. The series of images is then corrected for uneven illumination, serially registered to one another, and the 3D \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11173858492966545324", "cites_id": ["11173858492966545324"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/6142/614214/3D-cryo-section-imaging-of-blood-vessel-lesions-for-validation/10.1117/12.649093.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rKfAAxmFEZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
