Reduction in this decline is used to determine the efficacy of drug therapies designed to forestall the disease in preclinical AD clinical trials, measured by a Preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s Cognitive Composite (PACC). Most studies estimate rates of cognitive change by comparing cognitively normal (CN) older adults with abnormally high beta-amyloid (A\u03b2+) to those with low levels (A\u03b2\u2013). However, participants of preclinical AD clinical trials must be A\u03b2+ for entry. Therefore, we estimated the effect of very high amyloid (A\u03b2++) and A\u03b2+ on cognitive change over three years measured by different versions of the PACC in individuals with preclinical AD.Method: CN older adults underwent A\u03b2 neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments over three years as part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:jG_sDXCMgAMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5642135661460418493", "cites_id": ["5642135661460418493"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13803395.2019.1593949", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vW_po33kTE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
