These pathological changes are posited to arise in a stereotypical spatiotemporal manner, targeting intrinsic networks in the brain, most notably the default mode network. While this network-specific disruption has been thoroughly studied with functional neuroimaging, changes to specific white matter fibre pathways within the brain\u2019s structural networks have not been closely investigated, largely due to the challenges of modelling complex white matter structure. Here, we applied a novel technique known as \u2018fixel-based analysis\u2019 to comprehensively investigate fibre tract-specific differences at a within-voxel level (called \u2018fixels\u2019) to assess potential axonal loss in subjects with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_inCrQx-FbQC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8868351337175746148", "cites_id": ["8868351337175746148"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/141/3/888/4788771", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZIa4-422EnsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 11, "2019": 24, "2020": 40, "2021": 56, "2022": 58, "2023": 27}}
