We describe a pneumatic fuzzy controller associated with a pulse width modulation conversion scheme in a novel haptic device within a colonoscopy simulation system. A rubber bladder was used to simulate forces experienced during abdominal palpation during colonoscopy. The haptic device showed good steady-state response when tested with step inputs. A settling time of 0.41s was achieved on positive control step and 0.52-0.81s for negative steps. Dynamic response was adequate for mimicking interactions during inflation stages while noticeably deficient during deflation periods. Tracking accuracy averaged 94.2% within 300 ms of the reference input while the user was actively applying abdominal palpation and minor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15963123678843264697", "cites_id": ["15963123678843264697"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4810882/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uV4U32hoiN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
