FLAWS has the potential to improve the contrast of the subcortical brain regions that are important for Deep Brain Stimulation surgery planning. However, to date FLAWS has not been optimized for 1.5\u202fT.In this study, the FLAWS sequence was optimized for use at 1.5\u202fT. In addition, the contrast-enhancement properties of FLAWS image combinations were investigated using two voxel-wise FLAWS combined images: the division (FLAWS-div) and the high contrast (FLAWS-hc) image.FLAWS sequence parameters were optimized for 1.5\u202fT imaging using an approach based on the use of a profit function under constraints for brain tissue signal and contrast maximization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0kxB6oEY0CcC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18400959886636092718", "cites_id": ["18400959886636092718"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0730725X19302875", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Lg0oQYZXXf8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
