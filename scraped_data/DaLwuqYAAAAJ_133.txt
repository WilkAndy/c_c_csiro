The successful integration and deployment of the enabling software to clinical (research) partners, for rigorous evaluation and testing, is a crucial step to facilitate adoption of research innovations within medical settings. In this paper, we introduce the Simple Medical Imaging Library Interface (SMILI), an object oriented open-source framework with a compact suite of objects geared for rapid biomedical imaging (cross-platform) application development and deployment. SMILI supports the development of both command-line (shell and Python scripting) and graphical applications utilising the same set of processing algorithms. It provides a substantial subset of features when compared to more complex packages, yet it is small enough to ship with clinical applications with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dONrx3-W1TkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12943605547854284714", "cites_id": ["12943605547854284714"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260716305788", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qkeh6KrsoLMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
