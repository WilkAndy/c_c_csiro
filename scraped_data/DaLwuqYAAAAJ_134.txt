This prospective study aimed to determine the nature and magnitude of changes in crystallized and fluid intelligence, as well as their relationship to one another, in normal aging, taking into account the effects of preclinical AD.Cognitively normal older adults (n\u202f=\u202f494) aged between 60 and 84\u202fyears underwent serial assessment of fluid and crystallized intelligence at 18-month intervals over 72\u202fmonths and PET neuroimaging for the presence of abnormal amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2+; n\u202f=\u202f184). The effects of age and A\u03b2\u202f+\u202fon changes in fluid and crystallized intelligence were analysed using linear mixed models. An intelligence discrepancy score was developed from linear regression analysis of the extent to which fluid intelligence could be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:t1niNHmIXQYC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9823773602102273984", "cites_id": ["9823773602102273984"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289618301107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wGcq4woOVYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
