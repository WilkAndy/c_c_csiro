We measured on sMRI the cortical thickness (CT) from a large twin imaging cohort using a surface\u2010based approach (N\u2009=\u2009308, average age 22.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3 SD). An ACE model was employed to compute the heritability of CT. WM connections were estimated based on probabilistic tractography using fiber orientation distributions (FOD) from dMRI. We then fitted the ACE model to estimate the heritability of CT and FOD peak measures along WM fiber tracts. The WM fiber tracts where genetic influence was detected were mapped onto the cortical surface. Bivariate genetic modeling was performed to estimate the cross \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Pptk7XUfJl0C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11433163414887833969", "cites_id": ["11433163414887833969"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.23177", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:caFh44zBqp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
