We use intravascular and surface array coils giving high signal-to-noise but significant sensitivity inhomogeneity. In human carotid images, bias was corrected using a modified adaptive fuzzy c-mean method with a mechanical membrane model of the bias field. Noise reduction filtering, background segmentation, outlier class identification, and signal normalization were all designed to address specific, significant technical issues. In a synthetic image having a bias field measured from our MR system, variations across an area comparable to a carotid artery were reduced from 60% to <5% with processing while the misclassification rate was kept below 4% even with poor SNR (<7). Human carotid images were qualitatively improved and large regions of skeletal muscle were flattened and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15017802885357712208", "cites_id": ["15017802885357712208"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1398745/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UDOVECj0adAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
