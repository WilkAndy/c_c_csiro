This study aimed to determine the extent to which estimates of cognitive aging were biased by preclinical AD. Cognitively normal older adults (n = 494) with amyloid-\u03b2 status determined from positron emission tomography neuroimaging underwent serial neuropsychological assessment at 18-month intervals over 72 months. Estimates of the effects of age on verbal memory, working memory, executive function, and processing speed were derived using linear mixed models. The presence of preclinical AD and clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia during the study were then added to these models as covariates. Initially, age was associated with decline across all 4 cognitive domains.
