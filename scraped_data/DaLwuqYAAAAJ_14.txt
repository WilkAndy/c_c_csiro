The long-term cognitive consequences of the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology and neurodegeneration, and whether they have an independent or synergistic effect on cognition, are unclear. We aimed to characterise the long-term clinical and cognitive trajectories of healthy elderly individuals using a two-marker (Alzheimer's disease pathology and neurodegeneration) imaging construct.Between Nov 3, 2006, and Nov 25, 2014, 573 cognitively healthy individuals in Melbourne and Perth, Australia, (mean age 73\u00b71 years [SD 6\u00b72]; 58% women) were enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Alzheimer's disease pathology (A) was determined by measuring A\u03b2 deposition by PET, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:9kZNi-u_WhAC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6768304857920093776", "cites_id": ["6768304857920093776"], "pub_url": "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(16)30125-9/fulltext", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UL7gg2jZ7V0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 16, "2018": 46, "2019": 41, "2020": 35, "2021": 22, "2022": 33, "2023": 8}}
