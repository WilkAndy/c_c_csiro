One of the main concerns regarding the quality of the colonoscopy is to ensure that the whole colonic surface has been inspected for abnormalities. In this paper, we aim at estimating areas that have not been covered thoroughly by providing a map from the internal colon surface.Camera parameters were estimated using optical flow between consecutive colonoscopy frames. A cylinder model was fitted to the colon structure using 3D pseudo stereo vision and projected into each frame. A circumferential band from the cylinder was extracted to unroll the internal colon surface (band image). By registering these band images, drift in estimating camera motion could be reduced, and a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:LGA7_l5-FVwC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16853440296236719664", "cites_id": ["16853440296236719664"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-016-1462-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MJ5x9Kdy4-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
