The scheme was evaluated on an MR database of 7mm axial images of the lumbar spine from 20 subjects (fast bowlers and athletic controls). This scheme involved several steps, including (i) image pre-processing, (ii) generation of PAs for the QL, psoas (PS) and erector spinae+multifidus (ES+MT) muscles and (iii) segmentation, using 3D GACs initialized and constrained by the propagation of the PAs using non-rigid registration. Pre-processing of the images involved bias field correction based on local entropy minimization with a bicubic spline model and a reverse diffusion interpolation algorithm to increase the slice \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2079622377939960919", "cites_id": ["2079622377939960919"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4649291/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V4QQ0IhN3BwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
