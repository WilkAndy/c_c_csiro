Inspecting the whole colonic surface for abnormalities has been a main concern in estimating quality of a colonoscopy procedure. In this paper we aim to estimate areas that have not been inspected thoroughly as a quality metric by generating a visibility map of the colon surface. The colon was modeled as a cylinder. By estimating the camera motion parameters between each consecutive frame, circumferential bands from the cylinder of the colon surface were extracted. Registering these extracted band images from adjacent video frames provide a visibility map, which could reveal uncovered areas by clinicians from colonoscopy videos. The method was validated using a set of realistic videos generated using a colonoscopy simulator for which the ground truth was known, and by analyzing results from processing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:CoqsOaBEKcQC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16550052797470205419", "cites_id": ["16550052797470205419"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24553-9_49", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6-UrV1WZreUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
