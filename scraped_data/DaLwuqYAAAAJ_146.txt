With this cryo-imaging system, we sectioned cryo-preserved tissues at 2-40 \u03bcm thickness and acquired high resolution brightfield and fluorescence images with microscopic in-plane resolution (as good as 1.2 \u03bcm). Brightfield images of normal and pathological anatomy show exquisite detail, especially in the abdominal cavity. Multi-planar reformatting and 3D renderings allow one to interrogate 3D structures. In this report, we present brightfield images of mouse anatomy, as well as 3D renderings of organs. For BPK mice model of polycystic kidney disease, we compared brightfield cryo-images and kidney volumes to MRI. The color images provided greater contrast and resolution of cysts as compared to in vivo MRI.
