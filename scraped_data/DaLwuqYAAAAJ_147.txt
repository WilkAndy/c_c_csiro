It is unclear whether this occurs solely through APOE 4 increasing amyloid-(A) accumulation or through processes independent of A. Objective: To determine the extent and nature to which APOE 4 increases risk for clinical disease progression in CN older adults.Methods: Data from the total (n= 765) and A-imaged (n= 423) CN cohort in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models to estimate 4 risk for clinical disease progression over a 72-month follow-up.Results: With A status unknown and risk from demographic characteristics controlled, 4 carriage increased risk for clinical disease progression over 72 months by 2.66 times compared to risk of non-4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:xCS0c1RzPY8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4000060308812514275", "cites_id": ["4000060308812514275"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad161019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:48PoWqgRgzcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
