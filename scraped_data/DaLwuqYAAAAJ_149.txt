These first-generation tau tracers have varying degrees of \u201coff-target\u201d binding or lack of selectivity for tau. The new tau tracer, 18F-PI-2620 appears unique in that it binds to all types (3R, 4R and 3R/4R) of tau deposits in vitro. The purpose of the study was to assess the ability of 18F-PI-2620 to detect and measure global and regional tau burden in the brain in healthy older controls, AD and non-AD tauopathies such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD).    Participants with clinical diagnosis of probable AD, PSP, FTLD as well as healthy age-matched controls (HC) and participants classified as suffering mild cognitive impairment (MCI), underwent a 50-70 min static scan with 18F-NAV4694 to establish A\u03b2-status (A\u03b2-/A\u03b2+), and 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:viTTOddtVMkC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12896571341409629587,4179065534318532824", "cites_id": ["12896571341409629587", "4179065534318532824"], "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/59/supplement_1/410.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kzU0WU7T-bIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
