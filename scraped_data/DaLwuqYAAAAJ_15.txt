Here, we applied quantitative susceptibility mapping, a relatively new magnetic resonance imaging method sensitive to tissue iron, to assess the relationship between iron, amyloid-\u03b2 load, and cognitive decline in 117 subjects who underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging and amyloid-\u03b2 positron emission tomography from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL). Cognitive function data were collected every 18 months for up to 6 years from 100 volunteers who were either cognitively normal (n = 64) or diagnosed with mild cognitive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:iomT83CKXisC", "num_citations": 206, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2580538152883264096", "cites_id": ["2580538152883264096"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/140/8/2112/3983258", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YBrzG8fpzyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 24, "2019": 29, "2020": 32, "2021": 51, "2022": 44, "2023": 15}}
