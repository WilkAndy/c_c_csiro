During the intervention, clinicians observe the colon under bright light to diagnose pathology and guide intervention. We are developing a computer aided system to facilitate navigation and diagnosis. One essential step is to estimate the camera pose relative to the colon from video frames. However, within every colonoscopy video is a large number of frames that provide no structural information (e.g. blurry or out of focus frames or those close to the colon wall). This hampers our camera pose estimation algorithm. To distinguish uninformative frames from informative ones, we investigated several features computed from each frame: corner and edge features matched with the previous frame, the percentage of edge pixels, and the mean and standard deviation of intensity in hue-saturation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:JE23Nz_pzJ0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9517256638880980595", "cites_id": ["9517256638880980595"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-29965-5_15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c566DH0WFIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
