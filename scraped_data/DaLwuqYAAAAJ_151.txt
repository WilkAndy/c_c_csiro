The PET intensities were normalized to the ipsilateral cerebellum and reported as standardized uptake value ratios. One patient did not receive chemoradiotherapy. After rigid registration, the most metabolically active voxel in each post-treatment tumour was selected from the PET image. Using nearby anatomic features from the fused MRI, the corresponding location was selected on the pre-surgery image under the guidance of experienced specialists (PT, MF, RLJ, CW, AC) blinded to the pre-treatment PET image and patient outcome. The mean 18F-DOPA uptake within a 1-cm radius sphere centred on each landmark was calculated before computing the difference between baseline and follow-up. The 1-cm radius traded off the typical statistical variation in PET intensities and potential inaccuracies in spatial correspondences with the size of metabolically active regions. A Cox proportional hazards analysis model was used to evaluate the relationship between variations in 18FDOPA uptake and survival.Survival times, plotted in Figure 2 as a function of change in 18F-DOPA uptake, ranged from less than 30 weeks to more than 110 weeks. At last report, 3 patients remained alive. Variations in 18F-DOPA uptake ranged from less than\u201350% to more than+ 20%. The results, summarized in Table II, demonstrate that a decrease in 18F-DOPA uptake is a predictor of extended survival.
