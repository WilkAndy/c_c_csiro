To assist with clinical validation of the workflow we are investigating a cloud platform solution for research purposes. Benefits of cloud computing can include increased scalability, performance and extensibility while reducing total cost of ownership. In this paper we demonstrate the generation of DICOM-RT directories containing an automatic average atlas based electron density image and fast pelvic organ contouring from whole pelvis MR scans."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:aAWV-AKBBEQC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15673264262606196423", "cites_id": ["15673264262606196423"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/489/1/012048/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x453a86egtkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
