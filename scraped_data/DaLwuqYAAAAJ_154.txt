Each case compared pathology with a different benign condition: normal tissue, postbiopsy effect, and postradiation therapy change. Patients had white light followed by AF inspection. Abnormal areas of AF were cross-examined with NBI.ResultsNBI clearly showed dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. It also confirmed abnormal fluorescence because of earlier biopsies and radiation therapy. Analysis of the L* a* b* color space scale in each case showed segmentation between pathology and the benign tissue.ConclusionsThere may be additive and discriminatory benefits of NBI after AF inspection. Further study with computer-assisted color segmentation techniques and image analysis is required before optical diagnosis can become a reality in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13058907475558822602", "cites_id": ["13058907475558822602"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/bronchology/fulltext/2010/04000/combining_autofluorescence_and_narrow_band_imaging.4.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ynJg8yiPOrUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3}}
