Further, for the visualization and segmentation of small anatomical structures, there is a need to improve image quality, specifically signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), by acquiring multiple anatomical scans consecutively. We aimed to ameliorate movement artefacts and increase SNR in a high-resolution turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence acquired thrice using non-linear realignment in order to improve segmentation consistency of the hippocampus subfields. We assessed the method in 29 young healthy participants, 11 Motor Neuron Disease patients, and 11 age matched controls at 7T, and 24 healthy adolescents at 3T. Results show improved image segmentation of the hippocampus subfields when comparing template-based segmentations with individual segmentations with Dice overlaps N\u202f=\u202f75; ps\u202f<\u202f0.001 (Friedman \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:f408LfHov48C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2089690034832248619", "cites_id": ["2089690034832248619"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919307979", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K4_Z2AMSAB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
