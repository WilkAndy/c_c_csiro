A\u03b2 deposition accelerates gray matter atrophy at early stages of the disease even before objective cognitive impairment is manifested. Identification of at-risk individuals at the presymptomatic stage has become a major research interest because it will allow early therapeutic interventions before irreversible synaptic and neuronal loss occur. We aimed to further characterize the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between A\u03b2 deposition, gray matter atrophy, and cognitive impairment.To investigate the topographical relationship of A\u03b2 deposition, gray matter atrophy, and memory impairment in asymptomatic individuals with Alzheimer disease pathology as assessed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET).Regional analysis was performed on the cortical surface to relate cortical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=818606153179591", "cites_id": ["818606153179591"], "pub_url": "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/1691703", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x6H4mIToAgAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 18, "2015": 16, "2016": 22, "2017": 21, "2018": 27, "2019": 26, "2020": 13, "2021": 16, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
