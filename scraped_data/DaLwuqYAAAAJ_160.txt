However, results are difficult to interpret in regions with crossing fibres due to the simple Gaussian diffusion model assumed with the DT. High Angular Resolution Diffusion-weighted Imaging (HARDI)[3] has been employed by a number of higher order models (HOM)(such as Q-ball [4] and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)[5]) to resolve crossing fibres by estimating diffusion or Fibre Orientation Distribution (FOD) functions. Fibre tractography and connectivity studies benefit from HOM [6], however HOM for whole brain voxel based analysis has been largely unexplored. Recent work by Jbabdi et al.[7] used the crossing fibre model outlined in [6] for comparing partial volume fractions (PVF) of fibres between groups, assuming that PVF may be more interpretable than FA in regions with crossing fibres. This method permits differences to be detected in different fibre tracts within a multiple fibre voxel. However, this approach establishes correspondence using an FA-based skeletonisation procedure, and thus only takes a relatively small amount of the white matter into consideration, with no explicit attempt to match actual white matter tracts across individuals.In this paper, we present a novel measure, called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD), which enables voxel wise comparisons to be made over all orientations. The AFD measure is based on information provided by FODs. Any differences in the FOD amplitude along a given orientation can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11289240120117757750", "cites_id": ["11289240120117757750"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46330455/Apparent_fibre_density_A_new_measure_for20160607-15471-yg8y20.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nge1hxNwq5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
