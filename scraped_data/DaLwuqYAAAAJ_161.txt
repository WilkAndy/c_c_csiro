Automatic quantification of tau scans has thus become a priority. However, unlike A\u03b2 imaging, the topological distribution of tau is as critical as its total level. In this work, we extended our cortical surface based visualisation (CapAIBL) to tau images and developed a CenTauR measure to capture the characteristics and stages of tau deposition and spreading.MethodsTwo hundred and forty-three participants from the AIBL study underwent tau imaging with either 18F-AV1451 (n= 83) or 18F-MK6240 (n= 140). PET scans were quantified using CapAIBL with a tau specific atlas. Cortical tau burden, normalized to the cerebellar cortex, were projected on a cortical surface template and compared to a distribution of A\u03b2-ve healthy controls (A\u03b2-HC).
