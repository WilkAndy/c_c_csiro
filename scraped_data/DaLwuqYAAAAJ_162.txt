For visual inspection of the images, cortical surface based display presents the advantage of providing a compact and more convenient visualization than volumetric scans. We have developed an automated reporting tool to display the semi-quantitative PET signal for the most common tracers without the need of a MRI. To project the PET uptake on the cortical surface, our tool uses multiple PET atlases selected by a local and dynamic patch-based method. The method was validated by comparing the surface signal computed with and without MRI. Our tool is available on-line to registered users and the processing is performed remotely (                   http://milxcloud.csiro.au/capaibl                                    )."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:iHaZ0gpiSgoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16015474990168231076", "cites_id": ["16015474990168231076"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47118-1_14", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pEwhYqZlQt4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
