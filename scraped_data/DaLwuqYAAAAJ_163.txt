The RR was described as a brain region with similar cellular and blood flow characteristics as the target region but lacking specific (saturable) binding sites. It relied on two basic assumptions: that the degree of nonspecific binding and the volume of distribution of the free compartment were the same in the RR and target regions. The use of a RR was later applied to semiquantitative tissue ratio approaches, as the ones widely used for A\u03b2 imaging studies. With the advent of therapeutic anti-A\u03b2 trials there has been a renewed interest in optimizing outcomes by reducing the variance of A\u03b2 burden measurements. The purpose of this study was to first assess the stability of different RR and then look at the stable RR that yielded the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:SSsxPzPPytkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13665447333399693059", "cites_id": ["13665447333399693059"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.06.036", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AwcZdPJrpb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
