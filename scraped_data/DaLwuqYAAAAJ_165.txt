The registration of  11 C PIB PET images to an atlas allows spatial normalization and statistical comparisons. This generally involves a co-registration of the PET and MR which is then registered to an MR atlas. The use of PET to PET atlas registration is much less common, although important as MR scans are not always available. In this paper we present a study on using PET to PET atlas registration with the corresponding MR registration used as the reference standard. Average affine and non-rigidly aligned PET Atlases were created, as well as a principal component based generative atlases. From this work we found that the use of multiple registrations to a generative affine  11 C PIB PET atlas obtains the best results, with a mean translation error of 1.67 mm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17654246653140727759", "cites_id": ["17654246653140727759"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4541206/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z_eUect7APUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
