The purpose of the present study was to develop an atlas-based automated segmentation procedure to determine QL volume from MR images. An MR database of axial lumbar spine images from 15 fast bowlers and 6 athletic control subjects was used to generate the atlas-based segmentation procedures. Initially, all images were preprocessed with a bias field correction algorithm and reverse diffusion interpolation algorithm followed by affine and non-rigid registration methods to generate firstly an average shape atlas (AVG), then based on propagation of manually segmented QL data, develop a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=510547991349268819", "cites_id": ["510547991349268819"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4540945/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U5EpcbHUFQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
