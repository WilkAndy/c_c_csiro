A new anisotropic diffusion method allows one to create interpolated 3D images corrected for partial volume, without enhancement of noise. After a zero-order interpolation, we apply a modified version of the anisotropic diffusion approach, wherein the diffusion coefficient becomes negative for high gradient values. As a result, the new scheme restores edges between regions that have been blurred by partial voluming, but it acts as normal anisotropic diffusion in flat regions, where it reduces noise. We add constraints to stabilize the method and model partial volume; i.e., the sum of neighboring voxels must equal the signal in the original low resolution voxel and the signal in a voxel is kept within its neighbor's limits.  The method performed well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9293426901315985501", "cites_id": ["9293426901315985501"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/6144/614464/A-new-anisotropic-diffusion-method-application-to-partial-volume-effect/10.1117/12.649098.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XaD_Lofi-IAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
