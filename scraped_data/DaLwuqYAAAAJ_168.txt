To conserve the template mesh\u2019s topological properties, we train our model over a set of diffeomorphic transformations. This new implementation of a flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework benefits from a small GPU memory footprint, allowing the generation of surfaces with several hundred thousand vertices. To reduce topological errors introduced by its discrete resolution, we derive numeric conditions which improve the manifoldness of the predicted triangle mesh. To exhibit the utility of CorticalFlow, we demonstrate its performance for the challenging task of brain cortical surface reconstruction. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, CorticalFlow produces superior surfaces while reducing the computation time from nine and a half minutes to one second. More significantly, CorticalFlow enforces the generation of anatomically plausible surfaces; the absence of which has been a major impediment restricting the clinical relevance of such surface reconstruction methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:EF0m1YoOS5EC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15767727877386818542", "cites_id": ["15767727877386818542"], "pub_url": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f6b5f8c32c65fee991049a55dc97d1ce-Abstract.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7lOqpvY40toJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
