It is, therefore, an appealing option for brain morphometry studies. However, previous studies have reported a difference in cortical thickness computed from MP2RAGE compared with widely used Multi\u2010Echo MPRAGE. In this article, we demonstrated that using standard segmentation and partial volume estimation techniques on MP2RAGE introduces systematic errors, and we proposed a new model to estimate partial volume of the cortical gray matter. We also included in their model a local estimate of tissue intensity to take into account the natural variation of tissue intensity across the brain. A theoretical framework is provided and validated using synthetic and physical phantoms.
