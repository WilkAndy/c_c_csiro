The surface deformation process utilises the results of a multi-atlas registration approach, where training images are matched to the case image via non-rigid registration. Normalised mutual information is then used to measure the similarity between each image in the training set and the case image. The set of training images with a similarity greater than a threshold is then used to build the initialisation and the gray level model of the segmentation process. This case specific gray level model is used to deform the initial surface to more closely match the prostate boundary via normalised cross-correlation based template matching of gray level profiles.
