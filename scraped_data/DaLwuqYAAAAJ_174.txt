In this paper, an improved 3D shape context based non-rigid registration method is applied for mouse whole-body skeleton registration and lung registration. A geodesic path based non-rigid registration method is proposed for mouse torso skin registration. Based on the above registration methods, a novel non-rigid registration framework is proposed for mouse whole-body organ mapping from an atlas to new scanned CT data. A preliminary experiment was performed to test the method on lung and skin registration. A whole-body organ mapping was performed on three target data and the selected organs were compared with the manual outlining results. The robust of the method has been demonstrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6922785017278021806", "cites_id": ["6922785017278021806"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7965/79650E/Mouse-whole-body-organ-mapping-by-non-rigid-registration-approach/10.1117/12.877921.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rsBAc0usEmAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
