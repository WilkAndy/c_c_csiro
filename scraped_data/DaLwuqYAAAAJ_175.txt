The number of Australians with dementia is predicted to rise, from 234 000 in 2009 to over 1 million by 2050, as a result of the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Early diagnosis of AD will become more important as disease\u2010modifying therapies emerge within the next decade. Advances in molecular neuroimaging with amyloid\u2010\u03b2\u2010specific radioligands for positron emission tomography, aided by magnetic resonance imaging techniques, allow detection of AD years before symptoms of dementia develop. Longitudinal prospective studies, such as the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing, will determine the sensitivity and specificity of these analysis techniques for diagnosing AD and predicting cognitive decline."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3330832811690197161", "cites_id": ["3330832811690197161"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb02938.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qYACc8t-OS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
