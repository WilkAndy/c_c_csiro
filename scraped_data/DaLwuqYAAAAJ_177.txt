Interleaved image (or multipacket) acquisition is frequently used to reduce cross-talk and scanning time during full pelvic MR scans. Patient motion during interleaved acquisition can result in non-linear \"staircase\" imaging artefacts which are most visible on sagittal and coronal reconstructions. These artefacts can affect the segmentation of organs, registration, and visualization. A fast method has been implemented to replace artefact affected slices in a packet with interpolated slices based on Penney et al (2004) whose method involves the registration of neighbouring slices to obtain correspondences, followed by linear interpolation of voxel intensities along the displacement fields. This interpolation method has been applied to correct \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17530892312447315750", "cites_id": ["17530892312447315750"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7259/72592P/Nonrigid-correction-of-interleaving-artefacts-in-pelvic-MRI/10.1117/12.812460.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jm8M76w9SvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
