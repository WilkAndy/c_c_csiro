Recent work showed that deep convolutional neural networks could estimate morphometric measurements directly from 3D brain MRI within a few seconds, but with limited accuracy, especially for mean curvature and thickness. In this paper, we propose a more accurate and efficient neural network model for brain morphometry named HerstonNet: we developed a 3D ResNet-based neural network to learn rich features directly from MRI, designed a multi-scale regression scheme by predicting morphometric measures at different resolutions, and applied a robust optimization method to avoid poor quality minima, resulting in lower prediction error variance. HerstonNet outperforms the existing approach by 24.30% in terms of intraclass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:lIaPce-xyHYC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=696518851293138425", "cites_id": ["696518851293138425"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9434039/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-c2wdjSIqgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
