Post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have consistently reported cases with documented normal cognition despite high \u03b2-amyloid burden. It is of great interest to understand what differentiates these particular subjects from those without \u03b2-amyloid deposition or with both \u03b2-amyloid deposition and cognitive deficits, i.e. what allows these subjects to resist the damage of the pathological lesions. [11C]Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance brain scans were obtained in 149 participants including healthy controls and patients with subjective cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Magnetic resonance data were compared between high versus low-[11C]Pittsburgh compound B cases, and between high-[11C]Pittsburgh \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5150830121122421818", "cites_id": ["5150830121122421818"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/133/11/3349/311419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Olzic7Rse0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 23, "2015": 13, "2016": 7, "2017": 17, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 14, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
