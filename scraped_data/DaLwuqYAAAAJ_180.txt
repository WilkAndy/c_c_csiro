We implemented a stereospecific approach to generate both continuous and categorical measures that reflect tau spreading and deposition in order to make results from tau imaging studies clinically relevant and easy to interpret. Sixty-five participants underwent tau and A\u03b2 imaging with 18F-AV1451 and 18F-florbetapir (58 HC, 6 MCI, 1 AD), while 49 received 18F-THK5351 and 18F-flutemetamol (25 HC, 19 MCI, 5 AD). Three tau-masks were constructed: Mesial-temporal (Me) comprising entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:sWz8iI0ruhYC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13427499260613124380", "cites_id": ["13427499260613124380"], "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/57/supplement_2/128.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HGGqgm8PWLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
