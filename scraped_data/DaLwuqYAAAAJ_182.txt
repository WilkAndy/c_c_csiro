We investigate several interpolation approaches to reduce the anisotropy and present a novel approach \u2013 constrained reverse diffusion for thick slice interpolation. This technique was compared to common methods: linear and cubic B-Spline interpolation and a technique based on non-rigid registration of neighboring slices. The methods were evaluated on artificial MR phantoms and real MR scans of human brain. The constrained reverse diffusion approach delivered promising results and provides an alternative for thick slice interpolation, especially for higher anisotropy factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7308357699554968071", "cites_id": ["7308357699554968071"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611111001194", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BwJ3PZuAbGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
