This is a common requirement for transferring expert manual segmentations from radiotherapy treatment planning software into external image analysis environments (such as ITK). We provide an implementation of RT structure set importing and give some example results from prostate cancer radiotherapy planning volumes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11431467423694748959", "cites_id": ["11431467423694748959"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason-Dowling/publication/236274683_Importing_contours_from_DICOM-RT_structure_sets/links/00b7d5178a62ac2386000000/Importing-contours-from-DICOM-RT-structure-sets.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H33GKg67pJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3}}
