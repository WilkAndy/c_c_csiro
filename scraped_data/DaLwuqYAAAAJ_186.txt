Dark blood T1W, PDW and T2W MR images were used to measure carotid wall volume and MaxWA by two independent observers for inter-observer and intra-observer variability assessment.ResultsThe intra-observer absolute difference of carotid wall volume for T1W, T2W and PDW images were 67.3+/-47.5 mm (3)(2.3+/-1.8%), 63.2+/-52.2 mm (3)(2.0+/-1.3%), and 69.8+/-45.2 mm (3)(2.4+/-1.7%) respectively. The inter-observer absolute difference of carotid wall volume for T1W, T2W and PDW images were 103.5+/-141.8 mm (3)(3.0+/-3.1%), 95.9+/-102.1 mm (3)(3.1+/-2.6%), and 132.1+/-87.8 mm (3)(4.3+/-2.7%) respectively. The intra-observer absolute difference of carotid MaxWA for T1W, T2W and PDW images were 6.9+/-5.0 mm (2)(4.2+/-2.9%), 5.1+/-4.2 mm (2)(3.1+/-2.3%) and 7.5+/-4.7 mm (2)(4.2+/-2.7%) respectively. The inter-observer absolute difference of carotid MaxWA for T1W, T2W and PDW images were 9.5+/-4.2 mm (2)(5.8+/-2.3%), 6.4+/-6.1 mm (2)(3.8+/-3.1%) and 10.8+/-7.3 mm (2)(6.1+/-3.7%) respectively. Both intra-and inter-observer variability in carotid volume measurement tend to be smaller than that in carotid MaxWA measurement with intraclass correlation coefficients ranged 0.932 to 0.987 for volume measurement and 0.822 to 0.946 for MaxWA measurement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9940289243603136688", "cites_id": ["9940289243603136688"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/15923749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sPCZsWYA84kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
