The cause of cortical iron elevation in AD is unknown but may be contributed by hemosiderin deposits in cerebral microbleeds that frequently occur in this disease.Objective:To investigate the impact of cerebral microbleeds (which are more frequent in AD) on the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding brain tissue.Methods:32 MRI scans from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were found to have cerebral microbleeds by manual assessment of susceptibility weighted images. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM; an MRI technique that is sensitive to iron) was used to estimate iron content in the tissue surrounding the microbleed in four concentric radii. Furthermore, the mirror regions on the contralateral hemisphere were also demarcated. A simulation analysis was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:r90dRYkPj7EC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17727789928337136091", "cites_id": ["17727789928337136091"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:21lIkwPDBfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
