These lesions can be identified on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, on which they are hyperintense compared to their surroundings. These MRI-visible lesions appear homogeneously hyperintense despite known heterogeneity in their pathological underpinnings, and are commonly regarded as surrogate markers of small vessel disease in in vivo studies. Consequently, the extent to which these lesions contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s disease remains unclear, likely due to the somewhat limited way in which these lesions are assessed in vivo. Diffusion MRI is sensitive to white matter microstructure, and might thus be used to investigate microstructural changes within WMH. In this study, we applied a method called single-shell 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution, which models white matter microstructure while also accounting for other tissue compartments, to investigate WMH in vivo. Diffusion MRI data and FLAIR images were obtained from Alzheimer\u2019s disease (n = 48) and healthy elderly control (n = 94) subjects from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of ageing. WMH were automatically segmented and classified as periventricular or deep lesions from FLAIR images based on their continuity with the lateral ventricles, and the 3-tissue profile of different classes of WMH was characterised by three metrics, which together characterised the relative tissue profile in terms of the white matter-, grey matter-, and fluid-like characteristics of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:uYElc5AnwZoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18258440897663145393", "cites_id": ["18258440897663145393"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/623124.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sRWtUUIDY_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
