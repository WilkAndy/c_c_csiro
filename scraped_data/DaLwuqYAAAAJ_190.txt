Image correspondences can be computed by feature extraction and matching algorithms, which are computationally expensive and are challenged by low texture frames. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can estimate dense image correspondences with high accuracy, but lack of labeled data especially in medical imaging does not allow end-to-end supervised training. In this paper, we present an unsupervised learning method to estimate dense image correspondences (DIC) between endoscopy frames by developing a new CNN model, called the EndoRegNet. Our proposed network has three distinguishing aspects: a local DIC estimator, a polynomial image transformer which regularizes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KUgzLixe4cAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7561901380813487639", "cites_id": ["7561901380813487639"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01201-4_13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F37svT1F8WgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
