Their letter highlighted the potential contribution of cortical tau pathology to the degeneration of white matter fibre pathways in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that were demonstrated in our results. Indeed, this is an important potential explanation for the major findings of our paper, and we appreciate the insight provided by McAleese and colleagues, particularly from a histopathological perspective. While we agree with many of the comments put forward by the authors of this letter, there are a number of points that we wish to clarify both in regard to their interpretation of our results, and their suggestions for future research. First, we wish to address what seems to be a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:xmg73Fui0jkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18082901193527360871", "cites_id": ["18082901193527360871"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/141/6/e45/4969932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z32vBNRe8_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
