Estimating the position of the colonoscope tip with respect to the colon surface is important as it would help localization of cancerous polyps for subsequent surgery and facilitate navigation. Knowing camera pose is also essential for 3D automatic scene reconstruction, which could support clinicians inspecting the whole colon surface thereby reducing missed polyps. This paper presents a method to estimate the pose of the colonoscope camera with six degrees of freedom (DoF) using deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Because obtaining a ground truth to train the CNN for camera pose from actual colonoscopy videos is extremely challenging, we trained the CNN using realistic synthetic videos generated with a colonoscopy simulator, which could generate the exact camera pose parameters.
