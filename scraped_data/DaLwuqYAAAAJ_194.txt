In this paper, we present an automated MR-based cartilage segmentation method using an ensemble of neural networks for the individual femoral and acetabular cartilage plates of the hip joint. The segmentation is performed in two stages with different image resolution levels for segmentation of the combined hip cartilage and separation of the individual cartilage plates, respectively. Neural networks used in both stages are trained in an over-complete manner using 20 training MR images with manual labeled images. Compared with expert manual segmentations, the automated method achieved mean Dice's similarity coefficients of 0.805, 0.766 and 0.712 for segmentation of the combined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_9cyEV96HHsC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=134749144874898682", "cites_id": ["134749144874898682"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7950701/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-lQOIqK53gEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
