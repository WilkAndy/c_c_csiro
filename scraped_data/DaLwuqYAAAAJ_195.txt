Visual inspection is typically limited to the identification of gross changes in the mesial temporal lobe and ventricles. Using the same cloud computing platform for PET quantification (CapAIBL\u00ae), a new brain volumetric platform is publically available. CurAIBL\u00ae(Computational qUantification of mRi from AIBL) facilitates visual inspection with z-score maps of cortical thickness, normative graphs, and tables with volume of key structures in relation to a reference population.MethodsMR images are first rigidly registered to the MNI average brain, and segmented into grey and white matter and CSF using Expectation Maximisation Segmentation algorithm. The images are then parcellated using the 20 most similar atlases, selected from a database of 843 images.
