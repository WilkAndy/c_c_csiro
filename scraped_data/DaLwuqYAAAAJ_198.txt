In order to investigate differences between subjects, we present a method for non-rigid registration of FODs that incorporates a novel technique for correcting the orientation of each FOD based on a local affine model of the non-rigid transformation. The registration optimizes directly on the FODs, and is independent of the FOD estimation method used (Spherical Deconvolution or Q-Ball Sharpening Deconvolution Transform). Dataset from ten healthy young adults were used for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the spatial normalization results. Unlike existing techniques that employ scalar or diffusion tensor information, our method exploits additional information on the orientation of crossing fibers to provide more accurate spatial correspondence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8724828794006324161", "cites_id": ["8724828794006324161"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olivier-Salvado/publication/266451542_Non-Linear_Spatial_Normalization_of_High_Angular_Resolution_Diffusion_Imaging_Data_using_Fiber_Orientation_Distributions/links/54bc59610cf253b50e2d18ae/Non-Linear-Spatial-Normalization-of-High-Angular-Resolution-Diffusion-Imaging-Data-using-Fiber-Orientation-Distributions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wcPY4I_RFHkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
