Of these, 287 had 11C-PiB-positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at study entry. One hundred seventy-seven healthy controls (HC), 57 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 53 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were imaged. Controlled selection of HC ensured inclusion of very elderly, approximately 50% with subjective memory complaints (SMC) and 50% with an ApoE-\u03b54 allele. High PiB binding was present in 49% of HC carrying at least 1 ApoE-\u03b54 allele versus 21% of HC noncarriers (33% of HC overall). PiB binding increased linearly with age, most strongly in \u03b54 carriers. Subjective memory complaints was only associated with elevated PiB \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 1060, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16154753425991616576", "cites_id": ["16154753425991616576"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458010001648", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QEhBPqY2MeAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 49, "2012": 79, "2013": 116, "2014": 111, "2015": 104, "2016": 83, "2017": 103, "2018": 93, "2019": 82, "2020": 64, "2021": 79, "2022": 56, "2023": 22}}
