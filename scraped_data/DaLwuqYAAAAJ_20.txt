The robust definition of primary stroke boundaries and secondary brain lesions will have significant impact on investigation of brain\u2013behavior relationships and lesion volume correlations with clinical measures after stroke. Here we present an automated approach to identify chronic ischemic infarcts in addition to other white matter pathologies, that may be used to aid the development of post-stroke management strategies. Our approach uses Bayesian\u2013Markov Random Field (MRF) classification to segment probable lesion volumes present on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. Thereafter, a random forest classification of the information from multimodal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:NKe3Q23MlFgC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17545935010343681470", "cites_id": ["17545935010343681470"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191400336X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vv2f9-2uf_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 18, "2017": 15, "2018": 12, "2019": 25, "2020": 21, "2021": 26, "2022": 19, "2023": 7}}
