We propose a method to restore the ideal boundary by splitting a voxel into sub-voxels and reapportioning the signal into the sub-voxels. We designed this method to correct MRI 2D slice images where partial volume can be a considerable limitation. Each voxel is divided into four (or more) sub-voxels by nearest neighbor interpolation. The gray level of each sub-voxel is considered as \u201cmaterials\u201d able to move between sub-voxels but not between voxels. A partial differential equation is written to allow the material to flow towards the highest gradient direction, creating a \u201creverse\u201d diffusion process. Flow is subject to constraints that tend to create step edges. Material is conserved in the process thereby conserving MR signal.
