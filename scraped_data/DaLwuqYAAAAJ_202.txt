We use specially designed intravascular and surface array coils that give high signal-to-noise but suffer from sensitivity inhomogeneity. With carotid surface coils, challenges include: (1) a steep bias field with an 80% change; (2) presence of nearby muscular structures lacking high frequency information to distinguish bias from anatomical features; (3) many confounding zero-valued voxels subject to fat suppression, blood flow cancellation, or air, which are not subject to coil sensitivity; and (4) substantial noise. Bias was corrected using a modification of the adaptive fuzzy c-mean method reported by Pham et al. (IEEE TMI, 18:738-752), whereby a bias field modeled as a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4540225302754399723", "cites_id": ["4540225302754399723"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5370/0000/MR-coil-sensitivity-inhomogeneity-correction-for-plaque-characterization-in-carotid/10.1117/12.535958.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:65XqktseAj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
