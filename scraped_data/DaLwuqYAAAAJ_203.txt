Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a common MRI sequence where CMB appear as small hypointense blobs. The prevalence of CMB in the population and in each scan is low, resulting in tedious and time-consuming visual assessment. Automated detection methods would be of value but are challenged by the CMB low prevalence, the presence of mimics such as blood vessels, and the difficulty to obtain sufficient ground truth for training and testing. In this paper, synthetic CMB (sCMB) generation using an analytical model is proposed for training and testing machine learning methods. The main aim is creating perfect synthetic ground truth as similar as reals, in high number, with a high diversity of shape, volume, intensity, and location to improve training of supervised \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:l0_JBNIuc60C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13497234948888078273", "cites_id": ["13497234948888078273"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721002029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wSd2sqzPT7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
