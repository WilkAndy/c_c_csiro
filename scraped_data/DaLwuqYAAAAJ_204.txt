Brain iron has been reported to predict accelerated AD progression when measured using fluid biomarkers (CSF ferritin), quantitative susceptibility mapping MRI, or directly in post\u2010mortem tissue, and is one potential therapeutic target. Brain iron may contribute to neurodegeneration by becoming pro\u2010oxidant (e.g. ferroptosis), or by promoting an inflammatory phenotype of microglia. Deferiprone is an orally bioavailable, BBB\u2010penetrant moderate iron chelating drug approved for the peripheral iron overload in \u03b2\u2010thalassemia. Deferiprone reported promising evidence for disease modification of Parkinson\u2019s disease in two phase II studies; here we report the status of a phase IIb clinical trial of deferiprone for AD.The primary outcome of this trial is to compare the cognitive performance in a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:sq_mVe84DbIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14818251321269081755", "cites_id": ["14818251321269081755"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.044107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m9a09BABpc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
