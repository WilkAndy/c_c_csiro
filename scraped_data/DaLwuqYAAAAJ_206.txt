While both diseases share common risk factors, their interrelationship remains unclear. Increasing the understanding of how cerebrovascular changes interact with AD is essential to develop therapeutic strategies and refine biomarkers for early diagnosis. Objective: We investigate the prevalence and risk factors for the comorbidity of amyloid-(A) and cerebrovascular disease in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing, and further examine their cross-sectional association. Methods: A total of 598 participants (422 cognitively normal, 89 with mild cognitive impairment, 87 with AD) underwent positron emission tomography and structural magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of A deposition and cerebrovascular disease. Individuals were categorized based on the comorbidity status of A and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RGp4dj-Wy-oC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9187715271133778217", "cites_id": ["9187715271133778217"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KVFcSVxSgX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
