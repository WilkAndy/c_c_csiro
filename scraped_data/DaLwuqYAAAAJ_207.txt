This study aimed to investigate the independent and interactional effects of COMT Val158Met on cognitive performance. In particular, it was hypothesised that COMT Val158Met would modify the effect of neocortical A\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation and carriage of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele on cognition in preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In 598 cognitively normal older adults with known neocortical A\u03b2 levels, linear mixed modelling revealed no significant independent or interactional associations between COMT Val158Met and cognitive decline. These findings do not support previous associations between COMT Val158Met and cognitive performance and suggest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_TIfIljC7OAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15648942549751468294", "cites_id": ["15648942549751468294"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245183011930007X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BpFuXFY2LNkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
