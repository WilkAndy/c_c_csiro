Moreover, the lack of actual ground truth might limit the performance of any machine learning method to that of human performance. Yet, the automatic identification of those lesions is relevant to quantify cerebrovascular burden associated with dementia, such as identifying co-morbidity for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In this paper, we investigated a novel approach consisting of simulating synthetic CMB on SWI MRI scans from healthy individuals to create a large and well characterized training dataset, as a data augmentation strategy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:EbDKHhGulSgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8532513732145484407", "cites_id": ["8532513732145484407"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00536-8_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d5KsPQiUaXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
