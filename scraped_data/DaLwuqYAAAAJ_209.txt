To explore if selegeline reduced 18F-THK5351 signal in the absence of tau, we investigated the degree of signal reduction after a 5-day regimen of oral selegiline not only in AD patients, but also in other dementias (OD) and age-matched healthy controls (HC).    Ten participants (3 AD, 1 MCI, 4 HC and 2 OD), underwent a 18F-NAV4694 PET scan to ascertain amyloidosis, a baseline 18F-THK5351 scan, and a second 18F-THK5351 scan after a 5-day of a twice-daily 5-mg oral regimen of selegiline. Regional and global standardized uptake values (SUV), were generated for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:27qsyVibG6YC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6359341034977695512", "cites_id": ["6359341034977695512"], "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/59/supplement_1/1644.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GBdpY_rqQFgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
