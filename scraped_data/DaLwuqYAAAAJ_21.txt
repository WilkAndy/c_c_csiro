MRIs were inspected for microbleeds, siderosis, infarction, and white matter hyperintensity severity, blind to clinical and PiB findings. Neocortical PiB standardized uptake value ratio, normalized to cerebellar cortex, was dichotomized as positive or negative (PiB+/\u2212, standardized uptake value ratio >1.5). Annualized LMB incidence was calculated, and logistic regression was used to determine \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:HWVPSj4JXeEC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1902477004606482500", "cites_id": ["1902477004606482500"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/82/14/1266.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RCjrhMH0ZhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 8, "2015": 23, "2016": 16, "2017": 18, "2018": 13, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 17, "2022": 19, "2023": 4}}
