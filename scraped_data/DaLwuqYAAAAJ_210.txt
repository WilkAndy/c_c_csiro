While MR-based quantification remains the gold standard, there is great interest in PET-only quantification techniques for use in patients who cannot undergo MRI. In this study, 3 PET-only methods (single atlas, adaptive atlas, and PCA-based atlas) are evaluated and compared to an MR-based quantification in both AIBL (94 subjects) and ADNI (87 subjects). Results show that all quantifications performed using PET-only normalization approaches did equally well, with an average quantification error around 2% in both cohorts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:5XSfyxoPzb8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1879961017499409683", "cites_id": ["1879961017499409683"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7950725/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E12iv5X2FhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
