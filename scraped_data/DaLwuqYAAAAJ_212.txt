However, with generalised streamline weighting, it is difficult to localise the precise anatomical source and spread of injury or neuropathology. This limitation can be overcome by modulating the voxel weight based on the distance of the voxel from a given anatomical location along the tract, which we term diTWI: distance informed Track-Weighted Imaging. The location of known neuropathology can be delineated on any given imaging modality (e.g. MRI or PET). To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we measured tumour cell infiltration along WM fibre tracts in 13 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and 1 patient with Anaplastic Astrocytoma. TWI and diTWI maps were generated using information obtained from dynamic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15740836013409803132", "cites_id": ["15740836013409803132"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191300846X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fJv3pvSuctoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
