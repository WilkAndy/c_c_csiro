This is a common requirement for transferring expert manual segmentations from radiotherapy treatment planning software into external image analysis environments (such as ITK). An implementation of RT structure set importing is provided with sample data from a prostate cancer radiotherapy planning volume. This is an update to the 2009 Insight Journal paper \u201cImporting Contours from DICOM-RT Structure Sets\u201d which worked with ITK 3. x and a local GDCM2 install."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:foJkpVhfThEC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18436084903921020198", "cites_id": ["18436084903921020198"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason-Dowling/publication/236274612_Importing_Contours_from_DICOM-RT_Structure_Sets_with_ITK4/links/0deec5178a5042a432000000/Importing-Contours-from-DICOM-RT-Structure-Sets-with-ITK4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jm0no4oh2v8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
