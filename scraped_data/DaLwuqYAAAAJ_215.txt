C-11 PiB SUVR cut-off was 1.5 for high amyloid burden derived from previous studies, while cut-offs for HV and memory score were established using ROC analyses of the AIBL AD and HC. Cox proportional hazards were used to calculate risk ratios adjusted for age, gender and years of education.ResultsAt baseline, 74% of AD and 61% of MCI had significantly lower HV than HC, while 98% of AD, 65% of MCI and 31% of HC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15288311511755938513", "cites_id": ["15288311511755938513"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.1154", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0Vq6qVH-KtQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3}}
