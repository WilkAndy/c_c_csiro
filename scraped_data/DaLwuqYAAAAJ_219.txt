In multisequence 3T hip images, agreement between automatic cartilage segmentations and corresponding synthesized HDR\u2010MRI series were computed for mean voxel overlap established from manual segmentations for a series of cases. Qualitative comparisons between the developed HDR\u2010MRI and standard synthesis methods were performed on multichannel 7T brain and knee data, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:bf7w-NijnqMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12938115536461465947", "cites_id": ["12938115536461465947"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:W4m_BYhrjbMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
