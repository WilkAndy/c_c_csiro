A\u03b2 imaging studies have deepened our insight into A\u03b2 deposition, showing that A\u03b2 accumulation is a slow and protracted process extending for more than two decades before the onset of the clinical phenotype. Although cross-sectional evaluation of \u0391\u03b2 burden does not strongly correlate with cognitive impairment in AD, \u0391\u03b2 burden does correlate with memory impairment and a higher risk for cognitive decline in the aging \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:E9jS3u5z5twC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6026981117280893501", "cites_id": ["6026981117280893501"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001299816300794", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PbqD02QjpFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 23, "2018": 26, "2019": 30, "2020": 13, "2021": 23, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
