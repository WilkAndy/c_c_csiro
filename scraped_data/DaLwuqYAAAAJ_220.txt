Some limitations affecting image quality include receive field (RF) inhomogeneity and partial volume (PV) effects which arise when a voxel contains two different tissues, introducing blurring. The novel Magnetization-Prepared 2 Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echoes (MP2RAGE) provides an image robust to RF inhomogeneity. However, PV effects are still an issue for automated brain quantification. PV estimation methods have been proposed based on computing the proportion of one tissue with respect to the other using linear interpolation of pure tissue intensity means. We demonstrated that this linear model introduces bias when used with MP2RAGE and we propose two novel solutions. The PV estimation methods were tested on 4 MP2RAGE data sets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:OYCXtYc4maoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10964116194561738882", "cites_id": ["10964116194561738882"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10443-0_17", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gsj1rJZdKJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
