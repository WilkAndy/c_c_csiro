In this paper we present an automated method to identify chronic ischemic infarcts in gray matter and gray/white matter partial volume areas that may be used to measure the amount of tissue loss due to atrophy in the area. The measure of tissue loss may then be used as a potential biomarker in analyzing the relation between stroke and post-stroke depression. The automated segmentation method relies on Markov random field (MRF) and random forest based classifications. The MRF classification identifies the possible lesion areas from the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) images. Thereafter, the multimodal (T1-, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)) MR images \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6721335107330996190", "cites_id": ["6721335107330996190"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02126-3_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3nfTQKv6Rl0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
