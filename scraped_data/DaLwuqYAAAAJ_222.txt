Recent work has focused on the development of more interpretable quantitative measures that can be associated with a specific direction within a voxel containing crossing fibres1-5 (herein we use dixel to refer to a specific direction within a single voxel, corresponding to a single fibre population). Unfortunately, traditional methods for voxelbased analysis of 3D images (eg cluster-based methods available in SPM or FSL) cannot be applied to analyse dixel-specific measures, since the definition of the local neighbourhood for smoothing and cluster construction is ambiguous when adjacent voxels may have different fibre populations. In this work, we propose a novel statistical framework for whole-brain voxel-based analysis of dixel-specific measures, which uses fibre tractography to define each dixel\u2019s neighbourhood. We demonstrate the proposed method by investigating Apparent Fibre Density1 (AFD) in a cohort of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients and healthy controls. Methods: Cluster-based statistical methods exploit correlations in voxel intensities due to shared underlying anatomy and blurring introduced by smoothing, and are hence more sensitive than voxel-based methods when the observed effect is more spatially extended than the spatial scale of the noise. In the analysis of white matter, correlations in measurements would be expected to occur along the affected white matter tract rather than isotropically.
