The correspondence and parameter estimation problem can be modeled probabilistically by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and solved by expectation-maximization iterative closest points (EM-ICP) algorithm. In this paper, we propose to exploit the linearity of the principal component analysis (PCA) based SSM, and estimate the parameters for the unseen shape surface under the EM-ICP framework. The symmetric data terms are devised to enforce the mutual consistency between the model reconstruction and the shape surface. The a priori shape information encoded in the SSM is also included as regularization. The estimation method is applied to the shape modeling of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15325068896224432502", "cites_id": ["15325068896224432502"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8314/83140R/Consistent-estimation-of-shape-parameters-in-statistical-shape-model-by/10.1117/12.911746.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dlHYJfeUrdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
