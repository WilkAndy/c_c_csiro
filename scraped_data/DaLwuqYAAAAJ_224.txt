The associated long scan times increase the likelihood of subject motion. Furthermore, high b-value DWI is also more prone to eddy-current induced distortions. Existing methods to correct motion and eddy-current artefacts are inadequate due to the poor SNR associated with high b-values. We present a robust method to correct motion and eddy-current artefacts in high b-value data. Validation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately correct b= 3000s/mm 2 data with typical noise levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:AOeXN74AWYwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6593129962559067458", "cites_id": ["6593129962559067458"], "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2012/3555.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QlVR4MSAf1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
