Unlike existing measures such as Fractional Anisotropy, AFD permits population differences to be localised in both the spatial and orientation domains. This enables pathology-induced changes to be attributed to a single fibre population in a region containing multiple fibres. Our findings demonstrate a significant decrease in AFD in AD patients compared to healthy subjects within voxels and orientations corresponding to the cingulum, corpus callosum, uncinate fasciculus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus and anterior commissure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5876467730409026246", "cites_id": ["5876467730409026246"], "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2012/0989.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xnITFURojVEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 1}}
