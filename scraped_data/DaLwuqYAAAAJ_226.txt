The main objectives of the present study are thus to examine the relationships between global and local neocortical \u03b2-amyloid burden and global and local atrophy within separate groups of healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as in intermediate populations with subjective cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment.MethodsBrain magnetic resonance imaging and [11 C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography scans were obtained from 94 healthy elderly, including 49 cases with subjective cognitive impairment, 34 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 35 patients with Alzheimer's disease.
