This is especially true with regards to partial volume effects (PVE) and partial volume correction. Due to the nature of PET physics and acquisition, PET images exhibit relatively low spatial resolution compared to other modalities, resulting in bias of quantitative results. Although previous studies have applied PVE correction techniques on 11C-PiB data, the results have not been quantitatively evaluated and compared against uncorrected data. The aim of this study is threefold. Firstly, a realistic synthetic phantom was created to quantify PVE. Secondly, MRI partial volume estimate segmentations were used to improve voxel-based PVE correction instead of using hard segmentations. Thirdly, quantification of PVE correction was evaluated on 34 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2794342450746592706", "cites_id": ["2794342450746592706"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7262/72621O/Alzheimers-disease-detection-using-11C-PiB-with-improved-partial-volume/10.1117/12.813501.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wo2LZad_xyYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1}}
