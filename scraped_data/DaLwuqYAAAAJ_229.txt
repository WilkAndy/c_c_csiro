We extend the reverse diffusion algorithm to 3D and include a smoothing term to increase the robustness to noise. Evaluation on a synthetic data set showed a sharp reduction of PVE even in the presence of significant noise. Interpolation of actual patient MRI shows marked reduction of PVE"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12674656355168293086", "cites_id": ["12674656355168293086"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1625089/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3hD0Q81s5a8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
