High resolution three-dimensional (3D) morphological information contained in these images may be useful for early detection and monitoring of common spine disorders, such as disc degeneration. This work proposes an automated approach to extract the 3D segmentations of lumbar and thoracic IVDs and VBs from MR images using statistical shape analysis and registration of grey level intensity profiles. The algorithm was validated on a dataset of volumetric scans of the thoracolumbar spine of asymptomatic volunteers obtained on a 3T scanner using the relatively new 3D T2-weighted SPACE pulse sequence. Manual segmentations and expert radiological findings of early signs of disc degeneration were used in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16160327249825174849", "cites_id": ["16160327249825174849"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0031-9155/57/24/8357/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QRXlOwMEReAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 15, "2015": 16, "2016": 19, "2017": 17, "2018": 10, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 14, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
