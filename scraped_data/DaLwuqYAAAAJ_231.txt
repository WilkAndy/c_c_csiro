Recent generation tracers have high target to background ratios giving a wide dynamic range that may improve sensitivity for detection of low levels of tau . Building on previous evidence, this study aims to characterize the effects of tau deposition as assessed by 18F-MK6240, in a large cohort of patients across the AD disease spectrum.A total of 464 participants, enrolled in the AIBL-ADNeT study, underwent 18F-MK6240 tau PET, 18F-NAV4964 A\u03b2 PET, 3D structural MRI (hippocampal and whole-brain cortical volumes) and extensive neuropsychological evaluation. Participants included 266 cognitively unimpaired controls (CU), 112 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 86 patients with probable AD dementia. Evaluation included the characterization of the pattern and degree of 18F-MK6240 tracer retention in each clinical group as well as assessment of the relationship between 18F-MK6240 and age, A\u03b2 imaging, brain volumetrics and cognition in each of the clinical groups. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) were estimated in four predefined composite regions of interest (ROIs), reflecting the stereotypical progression of tau pathology in the brain: 1. Mesial-temporal (Me), 2. Temporoparietal (Te), 3. Remainder of neocortex (R), 4. A temporal meta-region termed metaT+.18F-MK6240 retention was higher in AD patients compared with all other diagnostic groups, with 18F-MK6240 distinguishing patients with AD from CU individuals, with the highest effect size obtained in the amygdala (Cohen\u2019s d: 2.07), and Me (Cohen\u2019s d: 1.99 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:aEyKTaVlRPYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12173860100539288641", "cites_id": ["12173860100539288641"], "pub_url": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.13.22270894.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QQzy9UI98qgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
