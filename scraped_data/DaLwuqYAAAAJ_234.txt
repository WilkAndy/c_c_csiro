During this procedure, some polyps may be undetected due to their positions, not being covered by the camera or missed by the surgeon. In this Letter, the authors introduce a novel convolutional neural network (ConvNet) algorithm to map the internal colon surface to a 2D map (visibility map), which can be used to increase the awareness of clinicians about areas they might miss. This was achieved by leveraging a colonoscopy simulator to generate a dataset consisting of colonoscopy video frames and their corresponding colon centreline (CCL) points in 3D camera coordinates. A pair of video frames were used as input to a ConvNet, whereas the output was a point on the CCL and its direction vector. By knowing CCL for each frame and roughly modelling the colon as a cylinder, frames could be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:uXirmJe02n4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=174641265670672764", "cites_id": ["174641265670672764"], "pub_url": "https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1049/htl.2019.0073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fNFsS05zbAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
