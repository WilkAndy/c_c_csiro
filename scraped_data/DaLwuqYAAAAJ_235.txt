We investigated if longitudinal A\u03b2 imaging with 18F-flutemetamol (Flute) PET can show change over time in A\u03b2 burden as previously shown with 11C-PiB in non-demented participants in the AIBL study.Flute-PET was performed and repeated 18 months later in 117 non-demented AIBL participants (100 HC, 17 MCI - mean age 73 years). SUVR was calculated with 4 reference regions - pons, cerebellar cortex, whole cerebellum and cerebellar white matter. Twenty-eight subjects had high A\u03b2 at baseline defined as SUVRpons >0.62.Increases in Flute SUVR were observed in 56/100 (56%) of HC and 12/17 (71%) of MCI. A significant increase was only observed in participants with high Flute retention at baseline (3% over 18 mths using SUVRpons, p=0.01). Change was smaller for other \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ObAD8Md4PD8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1223033286014967083", "cites_id": ["1223033286014967083"], "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/56/supplement_3/193.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K51mMUsW-RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
