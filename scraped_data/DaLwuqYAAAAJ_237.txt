A useful clinical tool is to estimate PiB-PET against the brain surface, which is however challenging using PET alone because of the lack of structural information. We propose a method to generate such estimate, where multiple atlases are selected and combined with local weights in a Bayesian framework. Qualitative and quantitative comparison with and without MRI are presented. Using PET only, the average error on the brain surface was around 13% compared to MRI-dependant method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12302780693815392100", "cites_id": ["12302780693815392100"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33418-4_28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZHdmrNtBvKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
