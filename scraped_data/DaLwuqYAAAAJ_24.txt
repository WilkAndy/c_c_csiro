With the use of structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, we can investigate the effect of AD on the morphology of the hippocampus. The hippocampal shape variations among a population can be usually described using statistical shape models (SSMs). Conventional SSMs model the modes of variations among the population via principal component analysis (PCA). Although these modes are representative of variations within the training data, they are not necessarily discriminative on labeled data or relevant to the differences between the subpopulations. We use the shape descriptors from SSM as features to classify AD from normal control (NC) cases. In this study, a Hotelling's T2 test is performed to select a subset of landmarks which are used in PCA. The resulting variation modes are used as predictors of AD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17862949727165758330", "cites_id": ["17862949727165758330"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191101175X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ejtgiCLy5fcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 8, "2015": 18, "2016": 13, "2017": 11, "2018": 11, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 2}}
