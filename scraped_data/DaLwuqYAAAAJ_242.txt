The software allows the extraction of anatomical data from individual patients for use in preoperative planning. State-of-the-art computer technology makes it possible to slice through the image dataset at any angle, or manipulate 3D representations of the data instantly.Although the software was initially developed to support planning for scoliosis surgery, it can be applied to any dataset whether obtained from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or any other imaging modality."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1840054117704764944", "cites_id": ["1840054117704764944"], "pub_url": "https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2011/194/4/interactive-image-manipulation-surgical-planning", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EI5JlXgviRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
