MRI offers an ideal modality for simultaneously imaging both the bony and soft-tissue structures of the spine and there have been many studies focusing on vertebrae and IVD segmentations from MRI (see for example [1]) but they rarely segment both at the same time and are often restricted to a particular acquisition type or parameters (Figure 2a, 2b). In this study, we introduce an automated segmentation algorithm for vertebral bodies and IVDs across the lumbar spine that is applied to MRI images with various properties. The segmentation scheme uses prior knowledge of the shape and appearance of the structures by incorporating a statistical shape models (SSMs) and a database of gray level profiles to account for appearance variations. The individual segmentations are initialized using a 3D spine curve that computes the initial vertebrae and IVD positions by analysing the intensity profile along this curve. The initial SSMs are then placed into these locations and the final segmentation is performed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5446598885845611395", "cites_id": ["5446598885845611395"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Faisel-Mohammed-2/post/How_can_I_correct_the_error_while_running_gradient_vector_flow/attachment/59d64714c49f478072eaecd7/AS%3A273982173974528%401442333848054/download/2011-Automated+segmentation+of+lumbar+vertebral+bodies+and+intervertebral+discs+from+MRI+using+statistical+shape+models.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g7PdUNQ0lksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
