We are developing the concept of the FA connectome, ie combining a measure of fractional anisotropy, a quantitative diffusivity metric that reflects the integrity of WM pathways, with the connectivity matrix. When applied to study Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, this technique shows identifies a number of key corticomotor pathways with reduced mean FA compared to control participants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12956448992609865812", "cites_id": ["12956448992609865812"], "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2010/0579.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VJD6araNzrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
