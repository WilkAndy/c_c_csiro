However, this approach requires a large number of manually delineated atlases, which are often not available. We propose a supervised method to build a population specific atlas database, using the publicly available Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR). The set of atlases grows iteratively as new atlases are added, so that its segmentation capability may be enhanced in the multiatlas based approach. Using a dataset of 210 MR images of elderly subjects (170 elderly control, 40 Alzheimer's disease) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, 40 MR images were segmented to build a population specific atlas database for the purpose of multiatlas segmentation-propagation. The population specific atlases were used to segment the elderly population of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16181546729720184026", "cites_id": ["16181546729720184026"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7624/76241N/Supervised-method-to-build-an-atlas-database-for-multi-atlas/10.1117/12.844048.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2vxaZQRnkOAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
