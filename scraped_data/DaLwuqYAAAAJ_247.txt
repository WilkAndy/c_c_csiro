Our particular interest is the computer-aided diagnosis and staging of the disease, especially the detection of vulnerable plaques. Multi-contrast MRI scans are used (eg PDW, T1W, and T2W) to assess the presence and morphology of vessel lesions in human arteries. The first chapter of this thesis reviews the existing techniques for atherosclerosis imaging with emphasis on MRI. The challenges facing intensity-based computer methods are then investigated. The subsequent four chapters address specifically the four main issues that have been identified: 1) Intensity inhomogeneity, which is present when surface coils or intravascular microcoils induce shading artifacts across the data. Artifacts are modeled as a smooth multiplicative bias field with a cubic spline. The cubic spline is optimized to minimize the entropy of the corrected image. Extension to intravascular axial images is presented. 2) Partial volume effect; despite recent improvements in MRI technologies, image resolution is still a limiting factor owing to the small size of the vessel wall and its lesions. A new approach is investigated to address this issue. Under the assumption that homogenous tissues are well separated by an edge, a reverse diffusion model is implemented. Extension to reduce noise is also introduced by using a diffusion coefficient function of the image gradient. 3) Misregistration; Patient and physiological motions induce misregistration between the datasets with different contrast, requiring methods with sub-voxel accuracy to re-align \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:2POsdo3tyOAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4180641799889932020", "cites_id": ["4180641799889932020"], "pub_url": "https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=case1152214735", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9M6WJ5GfBDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2}}
