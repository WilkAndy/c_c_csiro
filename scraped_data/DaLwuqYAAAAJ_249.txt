These frameworks require very long runtimes deemed unfeasible for real-time applications and unpractical for large-scale studies. Recently, supervised deep learning approaches have been introduced to speed up this task cutting down the reconstruction time from hours to seconds. Using the state-of-the-art CorticalFlow model as a blueprint, this paper proposes three modifications to improve its accuracy and interoperability with existing surface analysis tools, while not sacrificing its fast inference time and low GPU memory consumption. First, we employ a more accurate ODE solver to reduce the diffeomorphic mapping approximation error. Second, we devise a routine to produce smoother template meshes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:4EsMycecMEYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14810720554201906499", "cites_id": ["14810720554201906499"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16443-9_48", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q_3HnN8_is0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
