We aimed to determine the relationship between BDNF Val66Met and beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) on cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and A\u03b2 accumulation over 36 months in 165 healthy adults enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study. In healthy adults with high A\u03b2, Met carriers showed significant and moderate-to-large declines in episodic memory, executive function, and language, and greater hippocampal atrophy over 36 months, compared with Val/Val homozygotes. BDNF Val66Met was not found to be related to rates of change in cognition or hippocampal volume in healthy adults with low A\u03b2. BDNF Val66Met did not relate to the amount of A\u03b2 or to the rate of A\u03b2 accumulation in either group.
