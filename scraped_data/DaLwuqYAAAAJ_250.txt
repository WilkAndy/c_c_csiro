Most of the learning-based registration approaches considers this task as a one directional problem. As a result, only correspondence from the moving image to the target image is considered. However, in some medical procedures bidirectional registration is required. Here, we propose a registration framework with inverse consistency. The proposed method learns in an unsupervised manner a bidirectional transformation that approximates a diffeomorphism. We perform training and testing of the method on the publicly available LPBA40 MRI dataset and demonstrate its strong performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:uWFADo6cQ7YC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3786318420431667360", "cites_id": ["3786318420431667360"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9433911/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oABZ6Iq0izQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
