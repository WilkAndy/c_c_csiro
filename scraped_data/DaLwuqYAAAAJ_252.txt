Methods: Longitudinal cognitive decline was investigated using linear mixed modelling in a cohort of 590 cognitively normal older adults enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study. Results: No independent effect of Spondin-1 rs11023139 on cognitive decline was observed. However, significant associations were observed for the interaction between Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 and rs11023139 in individuals with high amyloid-\u00df burden. APOE \u03b54/rs11023139-A carriers declined significantly faster than APOE \u03b54/rs11023139-G G carriers in measures of global cognition (p= 0.011) and verbal episodic memory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:jtusTj6o6osC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6187738383780337770", "cites_id": ["6187738383780337770"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease-reports/adr200246", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:athGqEZD31UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
