Further, for the visualization and segmentation of small anatomical structures, there is a need to improve image quality, specifically signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), by acquiring multiple anatomical scans consecutively. We aimed to ameliorate movement artefacts and increase SNR in a high-resolution turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence acquired thrice using non-linear realignment in order to improve segmentation consistency of the hippocampus subfields. We assessed the method in young healthy participants, Motor Neurone Disease patients, and age matched controls. Results show improved image segmentation of the hippocampus subfields when comparing template-based segmentations with individual segmentations with Dice overlaps N=51; ps < 0.001 (Friedman\u2019s test) and higher sharpness ps < 0.001 in non-linearly realigned scans as compared to linearly, and arithmetically averaged scans."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:QXQxek9En5IC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15251554749045549014", "cites_id": ["15251554749045549014"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/597856.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1idI8TxoqNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
