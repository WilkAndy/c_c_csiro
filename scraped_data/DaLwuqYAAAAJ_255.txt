In this study, Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM; a new MRI modality that is sensitive to iron content) was used to investigate the impact of hippocampal iron on hippocampal atrophy, in a longitudinal study of cognitively normal individuals (CN) and AD patients.MethodsQSM-, T1W-MRI and 11 C-PiB-PET data from 56 CN subjects (age 74.2\u00b17.3) and 20 AD (74.9\u00b19.3) were collected as part of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Seven to eight year longitudinal data, acquired at 18-month intervals, included T1W-MRI and 11 C PiB-PET. Cross sectional data at baseline included GRE-MRI scans processed for QSM. A\u00df-amyloid PET, QSM, and volumetric images were normalized with cerebellar gray matter, middle frontal white matter, and intracranial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:CgSwehex2-EC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8305131891132615165", "cites_id": ["8305131891132615165"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.460", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_Um613PBQXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
