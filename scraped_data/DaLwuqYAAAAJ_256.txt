Here we investigated the association of education and physical activity with frailty and structural brain changes, using data from the multi-center Australian Imaging, Biomarkers & Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing.MethodsParticipants with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal controls (NC), who had 3.0 T T1-weighted MRI and clinical and cognitive assessments were included in the analysis (n= 494, mean age= 73.3\u00b16.6 years, women= 56.7%). A deficit accumulation-based frailty index (FI) was constructed using 33 variables assessing medical history, disease symptoms, vital signs and blood-test results, and calculated for each participant as a ratio of all deficits presented (a greater value meaning frailer).
