We developed and implemented a stereospecific approach to generate both continuous and categorical measures that reflect tau spreading and deposition in order to make results from tau imaging studies accessible for research and clinical practice.MethodsSixty-six participants underwent tau and A\u03b2 imaging with 18 F-AV1451 and 18 F-florbetapir (58-HC, 6-MCI, 2-AD), while 50 received 18 F-THK5351 and 18 F-flutemetamol (25-HC, 19-MCI, 7-AD). Three tau-composite masks were constructed: Mesial-temporal (Me) comprising entorhinal cortex, hippocampus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:4x91efyQ1HQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16318574345009652113", "cites_id": ["16318574345009652113"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.437", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kWEaQ-g4d-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
