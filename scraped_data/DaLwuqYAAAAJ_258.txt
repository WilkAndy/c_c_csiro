Little is known about the relationship between subjective memory complaints (SMC) and evidence of global or regional tau deposition. Our aim was to elucidate this relationship, and determine whether these factors would work in concert with amyloid (A\u03b2) and apolipoprotein \u03b54 genotype (APOE\u03b54) to influence memory and executive functioning in healthy older adults.MethodsHealthy participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were dichotomised into those with memory complaints (HC-SMC: n= 64) and without (HC-NMC: n= 23). Participants underwent A\u03b2 (18 F-florbetapir and 18 F-flutemetamol) and tau PET neuroimaging (18 F-AV1451; n= 60, 18 F-THK5351; n= 27) as well as APOE\u03b54 genotyping. Memory complaints were measured with the MAC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:c2351ekuFcIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16568887483479193306", "cites_id": ["16568887483479193306"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.637", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2nYxaGGD8OUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
