In recent years, quantification of non-heme iron has been reliably obtained using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MR technique, which allows investigating the association of iron with other well-established hallmarks of AD. While in AD increased iron levels can potentially be found in the core of tau tangles and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques, this relationship is poorly understood. This study aims at understanding the link between regional iron and A\u03b2 on a cohort comprised of non-demented subjects.MethodsQSM-, T1W-MRI and 11 C PiB-PET data from 51 HC (age 74.4\u00b17.2) and 15 MCI (74.5\u00b19.5) individuals were collected as part of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Anatomical parcellation maps were obtained by spatially normalizing anatomical templates to T1W image of each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:LimhlhUO2s4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18147312556824814834", "cites_id": ["18147312556824814834"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.1062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8mSHMZ802PsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
