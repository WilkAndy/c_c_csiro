Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical A\u03b2 (extracellular \u03b2-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4681709737570043998", "cites_id": ["4681709737570043998"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201340", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XohZmTPG-EAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 10, "2015": 16, "2016": 12, "2017": 17, "2018": 16, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
