This may influence treatment outcomes. However, treatment cannot be customised to intra-tumour variation without a method to establish outcomes at an intra-tumour scale. This work proposes a method to both assess and measure outcomes locally within tumours. Methods: Four patients were scanned at two post-surgery time points using contrast enhanced MRI and 3, 4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) PET. The shell of active tumour tissue is divided into a set of small subregions at both time points. Local outcome is measured from changes in subregion volume over time. The utility of the proposed approach is evaluated by measuring the correlation between PET uptake and documented growth. Correlation with overall survival time was also examined. Results: Local outcomes were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:VofzgsFG4o0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1020983523447913386", "cites_id": ["1020983523447913386"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/489/1/012073/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qruj7BpDKw4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
