We aimed to determine whether BDNF Val66Met moderates A \u03b2 amyloid-related cognitive decline, reduction in hippocampal volume, and A \u03b2 amyloid accumulation in healthy older adults.MethodsHealthy older adults (n= 165) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging for A\u03b2 amyloid using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), BDNF genotyping, and cognitive assessment at baseline, 18-and 36-months. Linear mixed models determined rates of change in cognition, hippocampal volume and A \u03b2 amyloid accumulation over 36 months.ResultsIn healthy older adults with high A\u03b2 amyloid, Met carriers showed significant and moderate-to-large decline in episodic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15672105299395625998", "cites_id": ["15672105299395625998"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.05.893", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DkT-RLyAftkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
