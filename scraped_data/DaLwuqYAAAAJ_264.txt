For each subject, anatomical T1-weighted MPRage and SWI images are available. 3D SWI was acquired on a 3-T Siemens TRIO scanner with 0.9\u00d7 0.9 mm in-plane resolution and 1.75 mm slice thickness, repetition time/echo time of 27/20 msec, and flip angle 20\u00ba. One expert had reviewed SWI images and in total 64 CMBs with prevalence of 2.1\u00b12.2 per subject were found. For each subject, the T1W MPRage was segmented using an expectation maximization algorithm to generate a brain mask. The dynamic intensity range of SWI was normalized to [0, 1] after trimming the top 1% of intensity values within the brain mask. The image was then inverted so that CMBs and vessels appear hyperintense. For pre-screening phase, a 3D multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian (trace of Hessian matrix) filter is performed to identify potential CMBs of varying size (2-10mm). This filter, which uses a range of \u03c3 (standard deviation), extracts local minimas as points of interest and sphericality was then assessed via eigenvalue analysis of the obtained Hessian matrix where three large negative values are expected. Small CMBs do not necessarily appear spherical due to partial volume effect and voxel anisotropy, and therefore the ratio of two highest eigenvalues is considered as decision threshold. This approach also allows defining a 3D patch around each candidate CMB since both size (relative to \u03c3) and center are estimated.Radon transform in which shape, size and intensity are combined is used as the preferred \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13116788457605971091", "cites_id": ["13116788457605971091"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/67497774/Automatic_Detection_of_Cerebral_Microble20210602-13752-1mrnv2k.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kzyMQZsxCLYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
