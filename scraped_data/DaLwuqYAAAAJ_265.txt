The interpolation technique is based on morphological shape-based interpolation combined with intensity based voxel classification. Shape-based interpolation in the absence of the original intensity image has been investigated intensively. However, in some applications of medical image analysis, the intensity image of the slice to be interpolated is available. For example, when manual segmentation is conducted on selected slices, the segmentation on those unselected slices can be obtained by interpolation. We proposed a two- step interpolation method to utilize both the shape information in the manual segmentation and local intensity information in the image. The method was tested on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8680302487694012309", "cites_id": ["8680302487694012309"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6411678/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:le_wUR-hdngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
