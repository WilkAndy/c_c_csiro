In vivo \u03b2-amyloid imaging using [11C]Pittsburgh compound \u0392 (PiB) positron emission tomography has made it possible to analyze the relationship between \u03b2-amyloid deposition and different pathological markers involved in AD. PiB allows us to stratify the population between subjects which are likely to have prodromal AD, and those who don't. The comparison of the cortical thickness in these different groups is important to better understanding and detect the first symptoms of the disease which may lead to an earlier therapeutic care to reduce neurone loss. Several techniques have been developed to compare the cortical volume and/or thickness between AD and HC groups. However due to the noise introduced by the cortical thickness estimation and by the registration, these methods do not allow to unveil any major different when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13918478527367242866", "cites_id": ["13918478527367242866"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8314/831413/A-surface-based-approach-for-cortical-thickness-comparison-between-PiB/10.1117/12.911752.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cmSgNXpeKMEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2}}
