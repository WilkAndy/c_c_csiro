Only a significant effect of the Pittsburgh compound B status was found: both Pittsburgh compound B-positive and-negative subjects showed a significant increase in amyloid-b deposition, with this increase being significantly higher in Pittsburgh compound B-positive individuals. This finding suggests either that Pittsburgh compound B-negative individuals have slower rates of amyloid-b accumulation than positive, or that the proportion of individuals showing significant increase in amyloid-b deposition, termed \u2018Pittsburgh compound B accumulators\u2019, is higher within the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group than within the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group. The bimodal distribution of the individual rates of neocortical amyloid-b accumulation observed support the existence of \u2018Pittsburgh compound B non-accumulators\u2019 and \u2018Pittsburgh compound B accumulators\u2019 and different clustering analyses led to a consistent threshold to separate these two subgroups (0.014\u20130.022 standardized uptake value ratiopons/year).
