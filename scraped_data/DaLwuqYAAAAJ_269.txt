The drugs in AD therapy are limited and the effect of them on AD patients is not satisfying. Polygonum multiorum Thunb, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used for thousands of years as a tonic and anti-aging agent, and frequently used to treat dementia in China. 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxy stilbene-2-O-\u00df-D-glucoside (TSG) is one of the active components extracted from Polygonum multiflorum, showing obviously neuroprotection effects in several AD-like models, but the exact mechanism is still not understood. To investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of TSG on AD therapy, we observed the lesion of MAPKs signal transduction pathway in the brain of different age AD-like transgenic animal and cellular models and to explore the protective effect of the drug.MethodsAPP695V717I transgenic (Tg) mice were observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4989920631699665196", "cites_id": ["4989920631699665196"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.1924", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LPHZdWDCP0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
