Many approaches have been previously proposed, which can be broadly categorised as mesh-based and voxel-based. While the mesh-based approaches can potentially achieve subvoxel resolution, they usually lack the computational efficiency needed for clinical applications and large database studies. In contrast, voxel-based approaches, are computationally efficient, but lack accuracy. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel voxel-based method based upon the Laplacian definition of thickness that is both accurate and computationally efficient. A framework was developed to estimate and integrate the partial volume information within the thickness estimation process. Firstly, in a Lagrangian step, the boundaries are initialized using the partial volume information. Subsequently, in an Eulerian step, a pair of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3643066643451597492", "cites_id": ["3643066643451597492"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841509000498", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tNIBeM_FjjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 10, "2011": 17, "2012": 14, "2013": 15, "2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 11, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
