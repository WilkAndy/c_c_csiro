In this paper, we face the issue of mouse whole-body skeleton registration from CT images. A novel method is developed for analyzing mouse hind-limb and fore-limb postures based on geodesic path descriptor and then registering the major skeletons and fore limb skeletons initially by thin-plate spline (TPS) transform based on the obtained geodesic paths and their enhanced correspondence fields. A target landmark correction method is proposed for improving the registration accuracy of the improved 3D shape context non-rigid registration method we previously proposed. A novel non-rigid registration framework, combining the skeleton posture analysis, geodesic path based initial alignment and 3D shape context model, is proposed for mouse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10972017594247258338", "cites_id": ["10972017594247258338"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7962/79620V/An-accurate-3D-shape-context-based-non-rigid-registration-method/10.1117/12.877915.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4qBxpt5vRJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
