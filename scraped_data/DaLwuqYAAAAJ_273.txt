Accurate image registration is a necessary step to quantify the characteristics of images acquired with time beings. Small animal registration is challenging because of its joint structure and posture and position difference in each acquisition. In this paper, we propose a non-rigid registration approach for the automatic registration of mouse whole body skeletons, which is based on our improved 3D shape context non-rigid registration method. The robustness of the approach has been validated on mouse skeletons. The whole body skeleton registration approach has been tested on 21 pairs of mouse CT images with variations of individuals and time-instances. The experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13317740928831742532", "cites_id": ["13317740928831742532"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP091809&sb=RECENT&n=1&rpp=50&page=60&tr=5490&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RGKyedAe0rgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2}}
