Primarily this is through the development of electronic health records (EHR) and electronic medical records (EMR). While the proper collection of this data has reached a high level of maturity, the use and analysis of it is only in its infancy. This data contains information which can potentially improve treatment for the individual patient and for the cohort of patients suffering a similar disease. The data can also provide valuable information for broader research purposes. In this paper we discuss the research contributions we are making in improving the use and analysis of patient data. Our projects include the analysis of physiological data, the extraction of information from multi-modal data types, the linking of data stored in heterogeneous data sources and the semantic integration of data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15927955241859956272", "cites_id": ["15927955241859956272"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-89376-9_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MD5iDed2C90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
