In vivo and post mortem experiments: Over ten 40455 kg farm pigs were anesthetized and imaged (IACUC approved protocol) with a Siemens Espree scanner using a 5Fr catheter mounted with opposed double solenoid microcoils (interventional Imaging Inc., Cleveland, OH)(2). Tracking was done under fluoroscopy and/or MRI to position the catheter tip at different arterial locations (eg carotid, aorta,). Multi4slice images axial to the catheter/vessel were acquired using TrueFISP (TR, 15 ms; TE, 8 ms; flip angle, 70\u00ec)(2). Images were taken in vivo and post mortem in situ with resolution typically about 0.2 x0. 2x3mm3 and fields of view of} 5.5 cm. Ex vivo imaging: Four human iliac artery samples were obtained at autopsy from human cadavers upon consent from family, positioned on a rig and into a plastic container filled with OCT gel and imaged at 37oC. High resolution 3D TrueFISP volumes were acquired \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17239640459859442060", "cites_id": ["17239640459859442060"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17239640459859442060&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jLlfoaiBP-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
