We sought to distinguish between brain and cognitive resilience by comparing interactions between the residual reserve index and amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration [\u201cAT (N)\u201d] biomarkers when predicting executive function. We hypothesized that the residual reserve index would moderate at least one path from an AT (N) biomarker to executive function (consistent with cognitive resilience), as opposed to moderating a path between two AT (N) biomarkers (suggestive of brain resilience).MethodsParticipants (N= 332) were from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The residual reserve index represented the difference between observed and predicted memory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:nlKf13ul9_IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5884245593258548996", "cites_id": ["5884245593258548996"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9413056/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BF9V5TAKqVEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
