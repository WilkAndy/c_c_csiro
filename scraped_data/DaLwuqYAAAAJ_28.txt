Cognitive function was reassessed 18 months later.Linear mixed-model analyses adjusted for baseline cognitive function indicated that, relative to individuals with low cerebral A\u03b2, individuals with high cerebral A\u03b2 showed significantly greater decline in working memory and verbal and visual episodic memory at 18 months. Compared with noncarriers, APOE \u03f54 carriers showed a greater decline in visual memory at the 18 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12510562832065064645", "cites_id": ["12510562832065064645"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/79/16/1645.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xW5xqZxynq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 17, "2014": 19, "2015": 19, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 14, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
