In this paper, we introduce SMOCAM (SMOoth Conditional Attention Mask), an optimization method that reveals the specific regions of the input image taken into account by the prediction of a trained neural network. We developed SMOCAM explicitly to perform saliency analysis for complex regression tasks in 3D medical imagery. Our formulation optimises an 3D-attention mask at a given layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike previous attempts, our method is relatively fast (40s per output) and is suitable for large data such as 3D MRI. We applied SMOCAM on a CNN that predicts Brain morphometry from 3D MRI which was trained using more than 5000 3D brain MRIs. We show that SMOCAM highlights neural network \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KOc9rAu6-V4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13192090667035691358", "cites_id": ["13192090667035691358"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9433972/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XoloJZG4E7cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
