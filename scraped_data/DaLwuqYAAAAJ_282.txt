From a mesh model, point clouds are necessary along with a robust distance metric to assess surface quality or as part of the loss function for training models. Current methods often rely on a uniform random mesh discretization, which yields irregular sampling and noisy distance estimation. In this paper we introduce MongeNet, a fast and optimal transport based sampler that allows for an accurate discretization of a mesh with better approximation properties. We compare our method to the ubiquitous random uniform sampling and show that the approximation error is almost half with a very small computational overhead."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:OvCsJ6o9tOQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1235305287797759193", "cites_id": ["1235305287797759193"], "pub_url": "http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Lebrat_MongeNet_Efficient_Sampler_for_Geometric_Deep_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2dxYRJ2vJBEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
