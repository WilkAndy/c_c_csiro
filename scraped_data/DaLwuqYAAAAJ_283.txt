Investigation of those with superior cognitive performance (SCP) for their age is important, as age-related decline has previously been thought to be inevitable. Objective: Preservation of cortical thickness and volume was evaluated in 76 older adults with SCP and 100 typical older adults (TOAs) assessed up to five times over six years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ypzvKOdbExQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12089393668179564809", "cites_id": ["12089393668179564809"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad201243", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CRmzJX0nxqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
