The choice of such a region often varies between studies which can substantially influence the quantification, resulting in study bias hampering objective findings which are detrimental to open science. This study outlines a list of criteria and a statistical ranking approach for identifying normalization region of interest. The proposed criteria include (i) associations between reference region and demographics such as age, (ii) diagnostic group differences in the reference region, (iii) correlation between reference and primary areas of interest, (iv) local variance in the reference region, and (v) longitudinal reproducibility of the target regions when normalized. The proposed approach has been used to establish an optimal normalization region of interest for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:HZAC7m4lW-wC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8013423299823071733", "cites_id": ["8013423299823071733"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00928-1_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9fHKxAhmNW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
