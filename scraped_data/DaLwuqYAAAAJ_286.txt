These first-generation tau tracers have varying degrees of \u201coff-target\u201d binding or lack of selectivity for tau. The new tau tracer, 18 F-PI-2620 appears unique in that it binds to all types (3R, 4R and 3R/4R) of tau deposits in vitro. The purpose of the study was to assess the ability of 18 F-PI-2620 to detect and measure global and regional tau burden in the brain in healthy older controls, AD and non-AD tauopathies such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD).MethodsParticipants with clinical diagnosis of probable AD, PSP, FTLD as well as healthy age-matched controls (HC) and participants classified as suffering mild cognitive impairment (MCI), underwent a 50-70 min static scan with 18 F-NAV4694 to establish A\u03b2-status (A\u03b2-/A\u03b2+), and 0-120 min \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:VTkKiNFP83YC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4179065534318532824", "cites_id": ["4179065534318532824"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2792", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2FgiOvYF_zkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
