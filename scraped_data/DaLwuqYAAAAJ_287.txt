However, SVD is not likely to be the only cause of WMH expression in AD, and the histopathological characteristics of WMH are known to be heterogeneous. Advanced diffusion MRI enables investigation of diffusional properties within WMH that could provide in vivo visualisation of underlying microstructural heterogeneity.MethodsHigh angular resolution diffusion MRI data (2.3 mm 3 voxels, 60 directions, b= 3000s/mm 2) and FLAIR images (0.9 x1x1mm 3) were collected from 48 AD and 94 healthy elderly controls (HC) from AIBL (Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study) on a 3T scanner. All data were preprocessed. WMH segmentations were automatically performed using the Hyperintensity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dnWPDgH667kC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18048448023750387907", "cites_id": ["18048448023750387907"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wyi-Utr3ePoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
