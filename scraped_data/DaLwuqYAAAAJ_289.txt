Previous studies have investigated microstructural changes to WM with voxel-based analysis of diffusion-weighted metrics; however, such voxel-averaged studies cannot provide fibre-specific information as they fail to account for the multiple fibre orientations that are present within most WM voxels. Here, we perform fixel-based analysis (FBA; whereby \u201cfixel\u201d refers to a specific fibre population within a voxel) in AD and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).MethodsDiffusion MRI data was acquired from AD patients (n= 49), MCI patients (n= 33) and healthy elderly control subjects (n= 95), as part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing.
