The present study aims to determine the relative contribution of regional \u03b2-amyloid deposition, hippocampal atrophy and white matter integrity to episodic memory deficits in non-demented older individuals harbouring one of the characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, i.e. with \u03b2-amyloid pathology. Understanding these relationships is critical for effective therapeutic development. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and [11C]Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography scans were obtained in 136 non-demented individuals aged over 60 years, including 93 healthy elderly and 43 patients with mild cognitive impairment. Voxel-based correlations were computed between a memory composite score and grey matter volume, white matter volume \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3767032214249034266", "cites_id": ["3767032214249034266"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/134/3/798/448239", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GlLEG9cvRzQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 19, "2013": 27, "2014": 11, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
