We investigated the impact of the ATN classification on disease progression and cognitive trajectories.Methods624 NC participants and 142 MCI participants who underwent evaluation for A status (either 11 C-PiB, 18 F-florbetapir, 18 F-flutemetamol, or 18 F-NAV4694 PET Imaging), T status (143 by either 18 F-AV1451, 18 F-THK5351 or 18 F-THK5317 PET Imaging and 54 CSF pTau) and N status (3D-MRI) were considered. Membership to each ATN group and the impact of ATN classification on disease progression were evaluated.Results40.5% of NC, 14.3% of MCI and 14.3% of AD were ATN negative; whereas 3.0% of NC, 33.3% of MCI and 42.9% of AD were ATN positive.
