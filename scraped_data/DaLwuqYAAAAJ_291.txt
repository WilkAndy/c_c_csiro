However, as preclinical AD occurs in cognitively normal older individuals the magnitude and importance of changes detected is difficult to determine and differentiate from normal cognitive aging. The aim of this study was to examine the nature of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) related cognitive change using models of cognition used to investigate cognitive aging, so as to provide a context for understanding cognitive changes in preclinical AD.MethodsOlder adults (n= 335) from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, who were CN, had no severe or uncontrolled systemic, cardiovascular, or psychiatric conditions at enrolment and did not progress to MCI or dementia over 72 months were included in the present study.
