Recent studies have validated the detection of CMI in vivo using both 7T and 3T MRI. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of CMI in patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (HC) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL), and to examine their association with vascular risk factors.MethodsParticipants were chosen at random from the AIBL database. Baseline imaging and clinical data were assessed in this cross-sectional analysis. CMI were visually graded using 3T MRI by simultaneously viewing 1x1x1mm isotropic T1-weighted and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images. They were defined on T1-weighted images as discrete \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:OBae9N4Z9bMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13953295366122158435", "cites_id": ["13953295366122158435"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.2124", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y7nQLzUQpMEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
