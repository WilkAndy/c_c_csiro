We compared the accuracy of MR-based and MR-less CapAIBL\u00ae quantification of 18 F-florbetaben against histopathology as the standard of truth.MethodsData from seventy-nine subjects (58% M, aged 80.4\u00b110.3 years) who underwent a 18 F-florbetaben PET scan and MRI during life and neuropathological assessment at autopsy (PET scans were acquired less than a year before death) were assessed. Image analysis was performed blind to post-mortem results. Fifteen subjects were randomly chosen for test-retest validation. Three subjects had an inadequate MRI and were excluded from analysis. A\u03b2 scans were normalised with CapAIBL\u00ae and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:UmJFWc0aipQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9627071696109764731,2634036043872497010", "cites_id": ["9627071696109764731", "2634036043872497010"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.2138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ewDXgbM6moUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
