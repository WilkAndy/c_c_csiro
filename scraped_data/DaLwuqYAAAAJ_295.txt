We have previously validated the PET-only approach using CapAIBL (capaibl-milxcloud. csiro. au) applied to the Centiloid quantification using the Centiloid Level-1 11 C-PiB data. In this study, we extended the use of CapAIBL for the Centiloid transformation of F-18 tracers, namely 18 F-NAV4694 (NAV) and 18 F-florbetaben (FBB).MethodsThe 34 young controls (YC) and 45 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients PiB PET calibration scans from the Centiloid level-1 study were used to calibrate CapAIBL against the prescribed Centiloid SPM pipeline using the standard cortical and whole cerebellum masks. Additionally, 991 PiB PET scans and their matching MRI from the AIBL study were used to refine the regression against the SPM pipeline.
