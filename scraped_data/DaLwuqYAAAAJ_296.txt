A 65-year-old woman underwent 11C-PiB PET scans that revealed an atypical focal and asymmetrical pattern of A\u03b2-amyloid deposition and MRI scans that revealed cerebral micro-haemorrhages and superficial siderosis. Almost all micro-haemorrhages were associated with focal A\u03b2-amyloid deposition. Follow-up 11C-PiB PET and MRI scans showed progression of the disease. We speculate that A\u03b2-amyloid deposition affects the structural integrity of arterioles, thereby predisposing them to micro haemorrhages. In support of this hypothesis, progression of MRI lesions was observed only in areas associated with A\u03b2-amyloid deposition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:oLQGhPHTrpcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15397795505952820432", "cites_id": ["15397795505952820432"], "pub_url": "https://www.bonemarrowjournal.com/articles/jnnd-aid1007.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0IxsgG71r9UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
