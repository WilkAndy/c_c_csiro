Being an exploratory study, we included contemporaneous matched-control data from the AIBL study. Other measures included FDG-PET, MRI volumetrics, blood A\u03b2 biomarkers, and cognition.Results40 subjects completed the first 12-month double-blind phase (placebo= 15, PBT2= 25) and 27 subjects completed the 12-month open-label extension phase (placebo= 11, PBT2= 16). Overall, PTB2 250mg/day was safe and well tolerated.
