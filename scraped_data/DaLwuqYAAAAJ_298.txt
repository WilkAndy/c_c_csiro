On each visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI, and a PiB-PET scan. A\u03b2 burden was calculated using the cerebellar cortex as reference region, and 1.4 SUVR (16 Centiloids-CL) was used to discriminate high from low A\u03b2 burdens. Rates of change for A\u03b2 deposition were derived from the slope of the linear regression plots. All participants with positive rates of A\u03b2 deposition, deemed to be on the \u201cAD-pathway,\u201d were used for the analyses.ResultsAt baseline higher A\u03b2 burdens were observed in AD (2.3\u00b10.4 SUVR/87\u00b115 CL) and MCI (2.0\u00b10.7 SUVR/64\u00b122 CL) when compared to HC (1.4\u00b10.4 SUVR/16\u00b15 CL).
