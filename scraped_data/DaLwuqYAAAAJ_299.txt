The aim of this study was to investigate if Vietnam war veterans without mild cognitive impairment or dementia, but with chronic combat related PTSD show evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathological markers, as assessed by amyloid and tau imaging with PET. Sixty-seven male participants -30 veterans with chronic PTSD (aged 67.9\u00b12.6 years) and 37 controls (aged 74.3\u00b18.3 years)- underwent both tau and amyloid PET imaging scans with 18F-AV1451 and 18F-florbetaben or 18F-flutemetamol, respectively. While 18F-AV1451 SUVR was calculated using the cerebellar cortex as reference region, the whole cerebellum and the pons were used as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:qdelZCX8GBYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16600539037047710969", "cites_id": ["16600539037047710969"], "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/57/supplement_2/1230.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-eQ7_0z2YOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
