A second PiB scan was obtained at follow\u2010up in 185 subjects and a third scan after 3 years in 57.At baseline, 97% of DAT, 69% of MCI, and 31% of HC subjects showed high PiB retention. At 20\u2010month follow\u2010up, small but significant increases in PiB standardized uptake value ratios were observed in the DAT and MCI groups, and in HCs with high PiB retention at baseline (5.7%, 2.1%, and 1.5%, respectively). Increases were associated with the number of apolipoprotein E \u03b54 alleles.
