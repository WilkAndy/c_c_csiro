To enable the use of voxel gray values for interpretation of disease, we created a new method, local entropy minimization with a bicubic spline model (LEMS), to correct the severe (/spl ap/80%) intensity inhomogeneity that arises from the surface coil array. This entropy-based method does not require classification and robustly addresses some problems that are more severe than those found in brain imaging, including noise, steep bias field, sensitivity of artery wall voxels to edge artifacts, and signal voids near the artery wall. Validation studies were performed on a synthetic digital phantom with realistic intensity inhomogeneity, a physical phantom roughly mimicking the neck, and patient carotid artery images. We compared LEMS to a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10636736751356398379", "cites_id": ["10636736751356398379"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1626318/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K8vwMbhHnZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 10, "2009": 8, "2010": 10, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 6, "2016": 15, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
