It is still unclear what are the long-term cognitive consequences of their presence, and if they have an independent or synergistic effect on cognition. The objective of the study was to characterize the clinical, cognitive and brain volumetric trajectories of the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a two-imaging (AD pathology and neurodegeneration) marker construct.MethodsFour hundred and ninety-seven (497) cognitively unimpaired individuals (HC, 73.0\u00b16.3 years; 56% female) were included in the study. A\u03b2 status (A) was determined with either PiB, flutemetamol or florbetapir, while neurodegeneration (N) was established using hippocampal volume. Following Jack et al,(2012, 2014) individuals were categorized as either AN-, A+ N-, A+ N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KrOX6H5u0oYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9555849063860720038", "cites_id": ["9555849063860720038"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.07.028", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ptGqMhgynYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
