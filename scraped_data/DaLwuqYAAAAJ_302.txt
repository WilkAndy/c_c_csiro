To date, a repeat scan at 18 months has been obtained in 124 participants. SUVR was calculated using the pons as reference region. Change was expressed as the yearly SUVR% difference from baseline.ResultsAt baseline, 56% of MCI and 19% of HC showed high Flute retention. At 18-month follow-up, increases in Flute SUVR were observed in 70/108 (65%) of HC and 11/16 (69%) of MCI. A significant increase (p< 0.0001) was observed at follow-up in non-demented participants with high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:3A6oGT7R4jcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14920914573103388139", "cites_id": ["14920914573103388139"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.07.030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:69XG9b-8Ec8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1}}
