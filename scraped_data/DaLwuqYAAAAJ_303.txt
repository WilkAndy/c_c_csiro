While the association between A\u03b2 burden and cortical atrophy has been widely studied, few studies have explored the in vivo the relationship between tau deposits and markers of neurodegeneration. This study looks at the association between 18 F-THK5317, 18 F-flutemetamol (Flute) and cortical thickness in regions known for early tau deposition.MethodsAs part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle study, 25 healthy controls (HC), 2 MCI and 3 AD underwent a structural MRI, an A\u03b2 (Flute) and a tau (18 F-THK-5317) PET scan. Hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness were measured with CurAIBL\u00ae and PET scans using CapAIBL\u00ae. THK retention was measured in the hippocampus, the fusiform gyrus (FG) and in the inferior temporal lobe (ITL) and normalised with three standard \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:yGgOC45Jz5YC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10543754245358641411", "cites_id": ["10543754245358641411"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.07.447", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A2GeeZ_wUpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
