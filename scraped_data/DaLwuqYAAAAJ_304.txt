New PET reconstruction algorithms enhance image lesion contrast but their effect on amyloid quantification is unclear. We compared the effect of three reconstruction algorithms on a Siemens mCT-standard, time-of-flight (TOF), ULTRA HD-on Flutemetamol quantification in the AIBL study.Methods114 subjects (80 HC, 22 MCI and 12 AD) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study were imaged using 3T MRI and 18F-Flutemetamol PET. Using the MilxView program developed by CSIRO and AIBL, MRI grey matter segmented cortex within AAL regions of interest were used to quantify regional and global cortical SUVR using the pons or cerebellum gray matter (GM) as reference regions. SUVR using the three reconstruction methods were compared.ResultsSUVR in ULTRA and TOF images \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RRCMsQZi3KMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17928987698353055676", "cites_id": ["17928987698353055676"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.497", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vKeu3lGP0PgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
