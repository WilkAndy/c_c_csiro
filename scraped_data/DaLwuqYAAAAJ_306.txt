We assessed the prognostic ability of different biomarkers in relation to disease progression in healthy elderly controls (HC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants of AIBL.Methods183 HC and 87 MCI participants were examined over 3 years. Frequency tables for progression to MCI, AD, and any dementia were constructed for PiB-PET, reduced hippocampal volume (HV), carriage of an apolipoproteinE-e 4 allele (e 4) and in HC, subtle episodic memory impairment as assessed by a composite episodic memory Z-score (EM) derived against the amyloid negative, cognitively stable AIBL HC subset and by the delayed word recall (WR)(Z-score<-1) from the CVLT II battery using age adjusted, published norms. Risk of progression was expressed as odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, gender and years \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1172349043764174218", "cites_id": ["1172349043764174218"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.05.005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ih1Vcj4FRRAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
