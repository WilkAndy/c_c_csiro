On each visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI and a PiB-PET scan. Beta-amyloid burden was expressed as PiB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) using the cerebellar cortex as reference region. A SUVR of 1.5 was used to discriminate high from low A\u03b2 burdens. Rates of change for beta-amyloid deposition, MRI volumetrics and cognition were derived from the slope of the regression plots over three to five years and used in the analysis. Those participants with a positive rate of beta-amyloid deposition were used to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5502121667224796714", "cites_id": ["5502121667224796714"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.04.253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Kv7pPYF2W0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
