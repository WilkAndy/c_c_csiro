For the segmentation of structures of interest such as the hippocampus in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, atlas based approaches have been the focus of most recent developments. These approaches typically rely on a database of pre-segmented atlases which are spatially normalized to the case to be analysed and a final segmentation is obtained via a consensus method. Previous multi-atlas methods treat each timepoint independently. We propose an extension that constrains the longitudinal deformation, forcing a consistent longitudinal path for all timepoints. This is further improved by building subject specific priors, by averaging the posterior probability estimate of all timepoints, and using these subject specific priors to re-segment all timepoints. This approach was applied to the data provided in the MICCAI atrophy challenge. Reproducibility tests showed an average coefficient of variation across all subjects of 0.30% for the brain volume, 1.13% for the hippocampus and 0.96% for the ventricles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Kaaf24wrr50C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7280134976871350506", "cites_id": ["7280134976871350506"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily-Dennis-6/publication/239523472_Analyzing_the_Structural_k-core_of_Brain_Connectivity_Networks_in_Normal_Aging_and_Alzheimer's_Disease/links/5ae7809345851588dd7f8791/Analyzing-the-Structural-k-core-of-Brain-Connectivity-Networks-in-Normal-Aging-and-Alzheimers-Disease.pdf#page=229", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6kBQjTA8CGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
