Understanding when and where cortical neurodegeneration starts may provide insights into the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we examined cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects, termed healthy controls (HC). While the majority of the HC present with low neocortical PiB retention, w30% present with high PiB retention. In this abstract, we evaluate the progressive loss of cortical thickness (CTL) in HC with large and low PiB retention independently. Methods: As part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle study, 53 HC underwent MRI and 11C-PIB PET scans every 18 months over 3 years. PiB scans were normalised using the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) method. A SUVR threshold of 1.5 was use to differentiate subjects with high PiB retention (PiB+) from those with low retention (PiB-). Based on this threshold, 15 HC (28%) were classified as PiB+, while 38 HC (72%) were deemed PIB-. The cortical thickness values from the baseline and follow-ups MRI were mapped onto their associated baseline WM/GM interface surface. Cortical thickness differences were corrected for age and years of education. All baseline surfaces were registered to a common surface to generate population statistics. Results: While the PiB-HC group exhibited some CTL, CTL was faster in PiB+ HC than in PiB-HC especially in the temporal (P= 0.05), posterior cingulate, and hippocampal regions.(Fig 1) No significant CTL was observed in the frontal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17648969608544428448", "cites_id": ["17648969608544428448"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46299442/j.jalz.2012.05.65920160606-26751-wxm71y.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oKH0yFm87fQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
