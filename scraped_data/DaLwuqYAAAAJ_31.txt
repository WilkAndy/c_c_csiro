The potential of PiB as an early marker of AD led to the increasing use of PiB in clinical research studies and development of several F-18\u2013labeled A\u03b2 radiotracers. Automatic quantification of PiB images requires an accurate parcellation of the brain's gray matter (GM). Typically, this relies on a coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to extract the cerebellar GM, compute the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and provide parcellation and segmentation for quantification of regional and global SUVR. However, not all subjects can undergo MRI, in which case, an MR-less method is desirable. In this study, we assess 3 PET-only quantification methods: a mean atlas, an adaptive atlas, and a multi-atlas approaches on a database of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:srBcWmd28BQC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5339494558288568467", "cites_id": ["5339494558288568467"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458014005454", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k-DrygKyGUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 17, "2019": 15, "2020": 18, "2021": 14, "2022": 23, "2023": 9}}
