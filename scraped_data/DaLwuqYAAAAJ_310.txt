Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging has been shown to be an ideal modality for OA assessment, providing direct and non-invasive visualization of joint structure. Morphological measurements (volume, thickness and surface area) of the cartilage tissue have been shown to be important in characterizing and monitoring OA progression, which allows the prediction of its subsequent changes and in-time therapeutic treatment before permanent damage has been developed. In this paper, we present validation of our fully automated scheme for the bone segmentation and qualitative bone-cartilage interface (BCI) extraction and initial cartilage segmentation from MR images of the hip joint."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3163428993036644600", "cites_id": ["3163428993036644600"], "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2012/1392.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-PAemujB5isJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
