The mortality rate of patients with high grade brain tumours is high, with a median survival time of only 12 to 15 months for grade IV brain tumour and 2 to 3 years for grade III brain tumour [1]. A factor contributing to this poor outcome is the relatively low sensitivity of CE MRI to tumour tissue as well as it limitation in differentiating tumour recurrence from chemo-radiotherapy induced injury. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using tracers such as 4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) has been shown to be clinically useful for detecting low grade and high grade brain tumours [2] with the limitations of low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio.
