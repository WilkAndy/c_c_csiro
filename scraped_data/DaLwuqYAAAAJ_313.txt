One system embodiment includes a memory to store a spatially dependent filtered data set having a first degree of homogeneity. The system embodiment may also include a filter logic to produce a data set having a second degree of homogeneity by filtering the spatially dependent filtered data set. The second degree of homogeneity may be greater than the first degree of homogeneity and may indicate spatial independence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8843642152136342215", "cites_id": ["8843642152136342215"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US8059907B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x_rBhq7tunoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
