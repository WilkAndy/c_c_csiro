In this study, we used 3-5 year longitudinal data from the AIBL cohort, to provide a better understanding of the cognitive and imaging changes that occur in the development of AD.MethodsEighty-one participants-50 elderly healthy controls (HC); 18 amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects; and 13 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients-were evaluated at enrolment and 18 and 36 months later. On each visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI and 11C-PiB PET. Rates of change for A\u00df accumulation and cognitive decline were derived from the slope of the regression plots over 3 years and used in the correlational analysis.ResultsA\u00df accumulation (0.05\u00b10.03 vs 0.01\u00b10.03 SUVR/yr, p= 0.0003) and memory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:FS78WRl2AkQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2844178201096408960,6738551092643388029", "cites_id": ["2844178201096408960", "6738551092643388029"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.142", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gM9COgGNeCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
