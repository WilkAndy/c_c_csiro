The aim of this study is to increase the discrimination power of hippocampal shape analysis between AD and normal controls (NC) by focusing on the subregions with atrophy associated with AD and describing the localized shape changes using statistical shape models (SSMs)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14668107473732250436", "cites_id": ["14668107473732250436"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-00646374/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RCsQSwiWj8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
