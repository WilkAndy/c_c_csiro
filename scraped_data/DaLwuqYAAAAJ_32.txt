Higher order information provided by FODs could improve several methods for investigating population differences in white matter, including image registration, voxel\u2010based analysis, atlas\u2010based segmentation and labeling, and group average fiber tractography. All of these methods require spatial normalization of FODs. In this article, a novel method to reorient the FOD is presented, which is an important step required for FOD spatial normalization. The proposed method was assessed using both qualitative and quantitative experiments, with numerical simulations and in vivo human data. Results demonstrate that the proposed method improves FOD reorientation accuracy, removes undesired \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3653357304852175741", "cites_id": ["3653357304852175741"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.23058", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fdtKyRxVszIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 14, "2019": 8, "2020": 18, "2021": 18, "2022": 15, "2023": 9}}
