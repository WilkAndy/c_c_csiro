Coronary heart disease remains to be the first cause of mortality worldwide. Typically, the problem of vascular lesion identification has been solved by trying to model the abnormalities (lesions). The main drawback of this approach is that lesions are highly heterogeneous, which makes the detection of previously unseen abnormalities difficult. We have selected not to model lesions directly, but to treat them as anomalies which are seen as low probability density points. We propose the use of two classification frameworks based on support vector machines (SVM) for the density level detection problem. The main advantage of these two methods is that the learning stage does not require labeled data representing lesions, which is always difficult to obtain. The first method is completely unsupervised, whereas the second one only requires a limited number of labels for normality. The use of these anomaly detection algorithms requires the use of features such that anomalies are represented as points with low probability density. For this purpose, we developed an  intensity based metric, denoted concentric rings, designed to capture the nearly symmetric intensity profiles of healthy vessels, as well as discrepancies with respect to the normal behavior. Moreover, we have selected a large set of alternative candidate features to use as input for the classifiers. Experiments on synthetic data and cardiac CT data demonstrated that our metric has a good performance in the detection of anomalies, when used with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:e_rmSamDkqQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11116239216514880708", "cites_id": ["11116239216514880708"], "pub_url": "https://theses.hal.science/tel-00860825/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xNSiyqvQRJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
