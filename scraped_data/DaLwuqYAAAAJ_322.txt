Using a cohort of Motor Neurone Disease and healthy subjects, we demonstrate a novel method for investigating morphological changes to white matter. We used a Fibre Orientation Distribution (FOD) registration method to normalise data towards a group average template, followed by group average fibre tractography to identify voxels and orientations of interest. Voxel-based analysis was then performed using the inferred fibre orientations to compute differences in perpendicular cross sectional area (and therefore differences in the number of axons)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:k6hhvAYhr9EC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18096596522097206191", "cites_id": ["18096596522097206191"], "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2011/0671.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r2MsL6gGJPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
