Post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have reported cases with normal cognition despite high beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden. It is of great interest to understand what differentiates these subjects from those without Abeta deposition or with both Abeta deposition and cognitive deficits.Methods[11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and brain magnetic resonance (MR) scans were obtained in healthy controls (HC) and patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). MR data were compared between PiB-positive and PiB-negative cases, and between PiB-positive cases with or without cognitive deficits.ResultsLarger temporal grey matter (GM) volumes, associated with better \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:8cTaIddhMp4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5401822706057829071", "cites_id": ["5401822706057829071"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2010.05.009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z1o3jiEh90oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
