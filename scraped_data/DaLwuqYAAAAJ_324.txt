This will enable dose calculations to be performed using the MRI scan without the requirement for an additional CT scan. The method developed uses atlas\u2010based deformable image registration. An MRI atlas was developed based on whole pelvic MRI scans for 39 patients. The atlas is then registered to an individual patient MRI scan. The registration of the atlas organ contours gives the automatically segmented organs on that patient scan. A CT or electron\u2010density atlas was also developed that corresponds to the MRI atlas. The deformation vectors that register the MRI\u2010atlas to the patient MRI scan are applied to the CT\u2010atlas to produce a pseudo\u2010CT scan for the patient. This can then be used for dose planning and digitally reconstructed radiographs.
