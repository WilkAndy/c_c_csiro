However, the results are difficult to interpret due to the presence of crossing fibres in at least one third of white matter voxels [2]. Multiple fibres within a voxel can be resolved by computing diffusion or Fibre Orientation Distributions (FOD) using methods such as Q-ball imaging [3] and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)[4]. Higher order models have improved fibre tractography studies [2], and more recently voxel based analysis [5]. Registration is an important step in group analyses of fibre tracts or their diffusion properties. Initial registration approaches employed scalar valued images such T1-weighted or DT invariants such as fractional anisotropy. More advanced methods have used the full DT, thereby including tract orientation information, which has been shown to improve the detection of white matter differences [6 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17747066790027538917", "cites_id": ["17747066790027538917"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP092167&sb=RECENT&n=33&rpp=50&page=53&tr=5493&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5TG5sDc_SvYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
