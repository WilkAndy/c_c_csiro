The construction of correct surfaces from magnetic resonance images (MRI) segmentation is a challenging task, especially when genus zero surfaces are required for further processing such as parameterization, partial inflation and registration. The generation of such surfaces has been approached either by correcting a binary image as part of the segmentation pipeline or by modifying the mesh representing the surface. During this task, the preservation of the structure may be compromised because of the convoluted nature of the brain and noisy/imperfect segmentations. In this paper, we propose a combined, voxel and surfacebased, topology correction method which preserves the structure of the brain while yielding genus zero surfaces. The topology of the binary segmentation is first corrected using a set of topology preserving operators \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15751741414509863280", "cites_id": ["15751741414509863280"], "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7623/1/A-combined-voxel-and-surface-based-method-for-topology-correction/10.1117/12.844624.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cGGrNVxtmdoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
