Cortical gray matter (GM) volumes and PiB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were measured after partial volume correction (PVC) within nine regions of interest. Regional correlations between PiB retention, cortical gray matter volume, and composite episodic memory (EM) z score were computed for all groups.ResultsAll of AD, 59% of MCI, and 34% of NC exhibited high cortical PiB retention (SUVR> 1.5). Significant correlation was found between PiB \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6317042951657824986", "cites_id": ["6317042951657824986"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2009.05.187", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2iJzbBilqlcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
