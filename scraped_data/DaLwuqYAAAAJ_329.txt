International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine", "abstract": "We are investigating the use of HARDI, utilising whole-brain track-density maps to improve definition of brain tumour margins. Our hypothesis is that infiltrating tumour will reduce WM connectivity enabling improved depiction of tumour boundaries. To assist in the determination of tumour extent, the 3D visitation maps are anatomically fused to 18F-FDOPA PET images. We report that infiltrating tumour delineated on 18F-FDOPA maps that is present outside of the tumour-enhancement boundary defined on CET1 images results in a reduction in WM connectivity or streamline density on corresponding whole-brain track density maps. This has significant implications for surgical and radiation treatment planning."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14666969154383139153", "cites_id": ["14666969154383139153"], "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2010/2435.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UVGeqryKi8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
