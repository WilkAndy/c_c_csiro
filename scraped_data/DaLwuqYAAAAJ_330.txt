Using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)[1], techniques such as Constrained Spherical Deconvolution [2](CSD) and Q-Ball [3] are able to extract fibre orientation distributions (FOD). FOD based tractography techniques can then be employed to investigate white matter connectivity. However, in order to compare fibre orientations and connectivity between individuals, spatial normalisation is required. High resolution T1 weighted (T1W) images are often used to estimate inter-subject correspondence. However, very little structural information is present in the homogenous intensity of T1W white matter and therefore registration of deep white matter structures is unguided. Using T1W images for normalising DWI data requires non-rigid coregistration between DWI and T1W to correct geometric distortions often present in DWI. Other registration techniques have focused on registering either scalar information computed from the diffusion tensor (DT)[4], or the DT itself [5]. The estimation of DT becomes less reliable at high b-values required for techniques such CSD, and therefore using the DT for spatially normalising HARDI data is less than ideal. In addition, the DT does not adequately model regions with crossing fibres. In this study we propose a registration method using a novel similarity measure that optimises directly on FODs. Unlike existing techniques, this exploits the additional information provided in voxels with crossing fibres, and is independent of the model used (eg Q-Ball or CSD)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5224199852664069980", "cites_id": ["5224199852664069980"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olivier-Salvado/publication/266347883_Non-Rigid_Registration_of_Diffusion_Weighted_Images_using_Fibre_Orientation_Distributions/links/54bc59620cf253b50e2d18af/Non-Rigid-Registration-of-Diffusion-Weighted-Images-using-Fibre-Orientation-Distributions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XJ-wRRYWgEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
