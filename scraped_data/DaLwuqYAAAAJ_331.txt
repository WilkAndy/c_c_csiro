Many ultrasound-guided procedures require extensive training and where possible training on simulations should be preferred over patients. Computational resources for existing approaches to ultrasound simulation are usually limited by real-time requirements. Unlike previous approaches we s...\u00bb"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:MOUuoOoUJb4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17936439637175663067", "cites_id": ["17936439637175663067"], "pub_url": "https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1630611", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:23kXldEI6_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
