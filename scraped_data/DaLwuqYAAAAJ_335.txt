It has been shown that APOE \u03b54 allele (\u03b54) relates to early pathological accumulation of cerebral amyloid\u2010\u03b2 (A\u03b2), leading to decade earlier age\u2010of\u2010onset of AD. However vascular and anatomical brain changes in the presence of A\u03b2 and \u03b54 gene have not yet been fully examined in middle age. We aim to investigate how \u03b54 and A\u03b2 level influence MR neuroimaging biomarkers such as white\u2010matter hyperintensities and hippocampus volume in mid\u2010life (45\u201065 year old) cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals.149 middle age (44 to 66 years of age) CU adults (age 58.2\u00b15.4, 115 Females, years of education 13.5\u00b12.8) underwent 3T MRI and amyloid PET scans using 18F\u2010Florbetaben as part of the PISA study. Of this \u03b54 enriched cohort (N=78 \u03b54 carriers), 12 were classified as A\u03b2+ (Centiloid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_OG5zn83XeQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.052681", "cites_per_year": {}}
