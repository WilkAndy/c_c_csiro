White matter (WM) microstructural damages are known to occur early at the preclinical stage of AD. Although stable associations between APOE\u2010\u03b54 status and WM alternations have been reported in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment, few studies have described WM differences in cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects at risk of AD. We aim to investigate associations of APOE\u2010\u03b54 status and A\u03b2 load with WM microstructural changes in mid\u2010age CU individuals.151 CU participants from the Prospective Imaging Study of Ageing (PISA) were included (aged 44\u201066, 78% female, 77 APOE\u2010\u03b54 carriers (\u03b54+) and 74 non\u2010carriers (\u03b54\u2010)) and underwent A\u03b2 PET and 3T MRI scans including multi\u2010shell diffusion\u2010weighted images.
