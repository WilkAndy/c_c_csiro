Interventions to modify the course of the disease have the greatest potential to avert neuronal death and later disease burden if they are introduced during this crucial window. Our prospective cohort study, \u201cProspective Imaging Study of Ageing: Genes, Brain and Behaviour\u201d (PISA) aims to characterise the natural history of AD at its prodromal phase. Using genetic risk prediction we have identified middle\u2010aged and older Australians at high risk of dementia to enable the discovery of biological markers of early neuropathology, identify modifiable risk factors, and establish the very earliest phenotypic and neuronal signs of disease conversion.We utilized APOE genotype and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to identify individuals at high and low risk of AD.
