The cause of cortical iron elevation in AD is unknown but may be contributed by hemosiderin deposits in cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) that frequently occur in this disease. In this study, we investigate the impact of CMBs (which are more frequent in AD) on the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding brain tissue.Thirty\u2010two cross\u2010sectional MRI scans from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL, www.aibl.csiro.au) study were found to have 77 definite CMBs by manual assessment of susceptibility weighted images (SWI). The subjects were classified as cognitively normal (CN; N=17; Age:77.4 \u00b1 6.1; CMB:48), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N=10; 79.1\u00b17.3; 18), or AD (N=5; 77.6\u00b16.2; 11).
