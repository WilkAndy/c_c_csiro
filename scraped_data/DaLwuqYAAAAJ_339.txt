However, the overlap between CAA and AD and the contribution of CAA pathology to cerebrovascular lesions are not well understood. We hypothesize that in subjects with high A\u03b2 load, the presence of imaging markers of CAA would be associated with greater white matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden.Data used in the preparation of this article was obtained from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of ageing (AIBL). See www.aibl.csiro.au. We analysed MRI (SWI and FLAIR) and 11C\u2010PiB\u2010PET data from 98 cognitively normal (CN), 34 mild\u2010cognitive impairment (MCI) and 38 AD participants. Subjects were classified as being A\u03b2+ if their A\u03b2 load was above 20 centiloid.SWI images were manually \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:pqgf-8x9CmQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.038899", "cites_per_year": {}}
