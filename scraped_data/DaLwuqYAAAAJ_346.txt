Examples of lumens may comprise a colon or bronchus. An input port receives the captured image data of the interior of the volume. The processor selects one of the multiple candidates such that the selected one of the multiple candidates corresponds to the captured image data. Each candidate is associated with simulated image data of the interior of the volume. The processor stores an association of the selected candidate with the captured image data to represent the interior of the volume. Aspects of the disclosure include computer implemented methods, computer systems and software."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:9Df4XUWggEMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US10424062B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T7Bfy1YGOtUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
