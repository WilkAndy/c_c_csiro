The influence of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) on this association is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the significance of WMH in cognitively normal adults\u2265 60 years old and how this is modulated by amyloid-\u03b2 burden.MethodsParticipants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker, and Lifestyle Study who were cognitively normal and had high-resolution FLAIR-MRI were included. WMH volume was expressed as percentage of total intracranial volume. Participants with WMH above the upper quartile for decade of life were classified as having high WMH burden (WMH+). Amyloid-\u03b2 load was assessed using PET (A\u03b2+ defined as SUVR/BeCKeT\u2265 1.4). In participants with\u2265 3 assessment timepoints, linear mixed models were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dJ-sGqsME_YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2019.06.907", "cites_per_year": {}}
