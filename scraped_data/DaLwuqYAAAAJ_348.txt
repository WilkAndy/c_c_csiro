We used longitudinal A\u03b2 imaging data from the AIBL and ADNI studies to calculate the rates of global and regional A\u03b2-amyloid deposition. We analyzed 485 participants from AIBL and ADNI (321 HC; 135 MCI; 29 AD) with 3 or more A\u03b2 imaging assessments. While AIBL participants underwent A\u03b2 imaging with PiB and NAV4694 (n=220, median follow-up of 4.8 -range 2.5-10.6- years), or flutemetamol (FLUTE, n=94, median follow-up of 3.2 -range 3.0-3.8- years), ADNI participants underwent A\u03b2 imaging with florbetapir (FBP, n=171, median follow-up of 4.1 -range 2.9-5.7 - years). CL were generated using the CL cortical and whole cerebellum masks. FBP SUVR were first generated using a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:rn2Io16i3IwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/60/supplement_1/248.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
