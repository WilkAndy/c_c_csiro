Neuropathological studies have shown that the initial plaques are located in the temporal and orbitofrontal cortices, extending later to the cingulate, frontal and parietal cortices (Braak and Braak, 1997). Previous studies have shown an overlap in 11C PiB PET retention between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and normal elderly control (NC) participants. It has also been shown that there is a relationship between A\u03b2 deposition and memory impairment in MCI patients. In this paper we explored the variability seen in 15 AD, 15 MCI and 18 NC by modeling the voxel data from spatially and uptake normalized PiB images using principal component analysis. The first two principal components accounted for 80% of the variability seen in the data, providing a clear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7400635431285539679", "cites_id": ["7400635431285539679"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908008884", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X8Px6bZWtGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 9, "2010": 13, "2011": 14, "2012": 10, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
