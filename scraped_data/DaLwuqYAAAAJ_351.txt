Epidemiological research indicates that veterans with TBI are 2-4 times more likely to develop dementia than controls; however, mechanisms contributing to this relationship are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate if Vietnam war veterans with a TBI show evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological markers, as assessed by A\u03b2-amyloid, tau and glucose metabolism using PET, as well as structural MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging, and neuropsychological testing.MethodsSixty-nine male veterans-40 with TBI (aged 68.0\u00b12.5 years) and 29 controls (aged 70.1\u00b15.3 years)-underwent, A\u03b2-amyloid (18 F-Florbetaben), tau (18 F-AV1451) and FDG PET, MRI, and neuropsychological assessment. The TBI cohort included 15 participants with mild, 16 with moderate, and 9 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:A_xf8jiGkywC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2155", "cites_per_year": {}}
