However, the specific relationship between protein and fibre intake on cognitive function in older adults at higher risk of AD remains to be determined. This study investigated the association of protein and fibre intake, with cognition using data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of ageing (AIBL) cohort.MethodsNeuropsychological data derived from AIBL (734) were grouped into two cognitive domains (PACC and the Boston non-memory score). Composite scores, calculated by averaging the normalised individual cognitive measure Z scores, were assessed between levels of fibre and protein intake (binary, below/above the recommended daily intake (RDI) age, gender, APOE e4 allele status, total energy intake, education and BMI.ResultsAverage values for the AIBL Study \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ZHR7-34Bl2wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.1987", "cites_per_year": {}}
