Imaging and chemical biomarkers represent in-vivo indicators of key disease features. Evidence suggests that these biomarkers as well as clinical/cognitive markers do not reach abnormal levels or peak concurrently, but, rather do so in an ordered, sequential manner. This has increasingly important implications with the introduction of prodromal and preclinical AD trials where such markers are used both for inclusion criteria and clinical endpoints. Moreover, it is paramount to understand the sequential ordering and progression of the various markers to effectively understand the natural history of the disease and to adequately time the implementation of the proper disease-specific therapies.MethodsWe applied our method for obtaining longitudinal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:cTLm0pkq19gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2957", "cites_per_year": {}}
