We evaluated the ability of 18 F-MK6240, a second-generation selective tau tracer, to detect and measure global and regional tau burden in the brain.MethodsEight probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 5 other dementia (OD), and 6 healthy elderly controls (HC), underwent A\u03b2-amyloid imaging with 18 F-NAV4694 and 120-min dynamic tau imaging with 18 F-MK6240. Global and regional 18 F-MK6240 binding was assessed using Distribution Volume Ratios (DVR) and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) at 70-90 and 90-120 min post injection, calculated using the cerebellar cortex as reference region.ResultsOne AD participant had both low A\u03b2 and tau tracer retention. Six of the 7 remaining A\u03b2+ AD patients showed high 18 F-MK6240 binding, greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:3NskZpgvI9IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.1055", "cites_per_year": {}}
