The presence of A\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques is linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the associations of CBF measured by arterial spin labelling MRI and A\u03b2 burden as measured by PET imaging in a cross-sectional design in CN and AD participants from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of Ageing.MethodsFor this study, 3D multi-phase pC-ASL, T1W and 11 C-PiB-PET data from 44 CN subjects (age 78.8\u00b16.9), and 7 AD (77.3\u00b16.7) were collected as part of the AIBL study. PET images evaluated through CapAIBL\u00a9 provided the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of grey-matter to the cerebellum. Participants were classified as being A\u03b2+(vs A\u03b2-) when above 1.4 SUVR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:WIzaTCs-0dQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.449", "cites_per_year": {}}
