In the current study, we examine AD risk by combining a newly developed CVD index with a targeted selection of\u223c 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).MethodsCognitively normal (CN) and AD participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were given one point for each of the following nine CVD risk factors; 1) BMI\u2265 25; 2) systolic blood pressure\u2265 140mmHg, and/or diastolic\u2265 90mmHg, and/or a history of hypertension; a history of 3) angina; 4) heart attack; 5) stroke; 6) smoking; 7) diabetes; 8) low physical activity, and; 9) elevated homocysteine level (> 10\u03bcmol/L). Points were summed to produce an index ranging from 0-9, with a higher score indicating higher CVD risk.
