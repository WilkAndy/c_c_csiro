We evaluated the prevalence and influence of MRI-defined CeVD in a group of cognitively normal (CN) adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. We subsequently derived a numeric index that characterised patients with significant CeVD. We hypothesized that positivity on this index would be associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, and that this association would be greatest in patients with high amyloid-\u03b2 burden.Methods218 participants underwent PET, MRI and cognitive assessment at 18-month intervals as part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle study of Ageing. High-resolution T1/FLAIR images were reviewed for cortical microinfarcts, large cortical infarcts, and lacunes.
