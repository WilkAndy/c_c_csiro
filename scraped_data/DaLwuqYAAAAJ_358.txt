Tau deposits have been tightly associated with grey matter atrophy. This grey matter atrophy may affect PET quantification. In this study, we investigate the effect of two partial volume correction (PVC) software packages (CapAIBL\u00ae and PMOD\u00ae) in improving 18 F-AV1451 signal.MethodsTwenty-two subjects (13 Normal controls (NC), 7 mild cognitively impaired and 2 Alzheimer's disease patients) underwent a 18 F-AV1451 scan and a T1w MRI. Three tau-specific masks, capturing the stereospecific pattern of tau deposition in the brain were applied: Mesial-temporal (Me), Temporoparietal (Te) and Rest (R) of the neocortex. Tau tracer retention in the MeTeR regions, expressed as SUVR using the whole cerebellum as reference region, were analyzed using CapAIBL\u00ae and PMOD\u00ae \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:CY3uIpTmi-gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2292", "cites_per_year": {}}
