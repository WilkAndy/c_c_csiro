Specific inflammatory biomarkers such as interleukins, C-reactive protein and TNF\u03b1 have been identified by several research groups as being associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In the current study, we investigated modulation of AD risk by combining a targeted selection of\u223c 2000 AD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a novel inflammatory index, using data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study.MethodsA panel of 18 biomarkers from the Rules Based Medicine platform, measured on the baseline AIBL dataset, were used to derive a peripheral inflammatory burden score, with a value of one for each biomarker assigned to either cognitively normal (CN) or AD participants who had a value in the top 20% of the risk range.
