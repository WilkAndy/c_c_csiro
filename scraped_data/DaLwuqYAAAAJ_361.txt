To explore if selegiline reduced 18 F-THK5351 signal in the absence of tau, we investigated the degree of signal reduction after a 5-day regimen of oral selegiline not only in AD patients, but also in other dementia (OD) and age-matched healthy controls (HC).MethodsTen participants (3 AD, 1 MCI, 4 HC and 2 OD), underwent a 18 F-NAV4694 PET scan to ascertain Ab-amyloidosis, a baseline 18 F-THK5351 scan, and a second 18 F-THK5351 scan after a 5-day of a twice-daily 5-mg oral regimen of selegiline.
