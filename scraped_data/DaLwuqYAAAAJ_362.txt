A tracer-specific visual assessment has to be performed by trained readers. However, accurate visual interpretation of PET scans can be challenging, particularly for less experienced readers. In this study, we investigated the added value of using semiquantitative reports, generated using the image analysis software CapAIBL\u00ae, alongside visual A\u03b2 image inspection.MethodsForty-eight subjects with a wide spectrum of dementia diagnoses confirmed by autopsy, were identified from two independent databases. Subjects underwent either a 11 C-PiB or 18 F-florbetaben PET scan; Centiloid (CL) values were generated using CapAIBL. Four readers (CR, PR, TC and VD), blinded to clinicopathological diagnosis, visually categorized all scans in regards to A\u03b2 plaque load (0 no A\u03b2 load, 1 minor A\u03b2 load, 2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:41wR57jXX04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.2072", "cites_per_year": {}}
