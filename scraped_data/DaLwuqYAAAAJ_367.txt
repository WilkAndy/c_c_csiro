Experimental evidence from mouse models show that the induction of type 2 diabetes/insulin resistance can promote the accumulation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological features. However, the association of type 2 diabetes with pathological and clinical phenotypes in humans is unclear. The overall aim of this study was to investigate if assessments of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or pancreatic \u03b2-cell function (HOMA-B) are altered across the course of AD and ascertain their associations with pathological and clinical expressions of AD in the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, a calculated HOMA-IR index was compared between clinical groups (cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia (AD)) using analysis of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Y3Sh7dCAXz0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.2000", "cites_per_year": {}}
