Specifically in Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a distinct pattern of thinning of the cortical ribbon. While there is no cure or effective treatment currently available for AD, early intervention prevention programs hold considerable promise. Following particular dietary patterns represents one potential intervention strategy accessible to all, with adherence to healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean Diet (MeDi), proposed to be associated with improved brain health; however, the relationship of MeDi adherence to cortical thinning has not been thoroughly characterised.MethodsCognitively normal participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (n= 269; mean age 71.74\u00b17.0; 43% male), completed the Cancer Council of Victoria food frequency questionnaire at baseline, from which a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:MWSB05WFU5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.07.724", "cites_per_year": {}}
