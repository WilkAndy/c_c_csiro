However, how \u03b54 carriage affects pathological changes remains unclear. We have attempted to elucidate the impact of \u03b54 carriage on A\u03b2-amyloid deposition.Methods194 AIBL participants (86 \u03b54 carriers [72.22\u00b17.21] and 108 non \u03b54 carriers [72.29\u00b17.43]) with a mean follow-up of 6.12\u00b12.00 years were analysed. The odds ratio and NPV/PPV statistics for the progression of normal controls (NC) to MCI/AD for \u03b54 carriers vs non-carriers were calculated. Further, the natural history of deposition of A\u03b2-amyloid was estimated for \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers using a 4-step procedure [1, 2]. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to estimate the prevalence of abnormal levels of A\u03b2-amyloid by age for \u03b54 carriers and non-carriers.ResultsNC \u03b54 carriers are twice as likely (OR 2.21) to progress to MCI or AD in comparison to non-carriers.
