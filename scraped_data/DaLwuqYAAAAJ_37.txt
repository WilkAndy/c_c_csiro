However, this has never been empirically tested. We compared the rate of cognitive decline associated with high A\u03b2 (A\u03b2+) and very high A\u03b2 (A\u03b2++) in cognitively normal (CN) older adults on three multidomain cognitive composite scores and one single-domain (EM) composite score.CN older adults (n = 423) underwent A\u03b2 neuroimaging and completed neuropsychological assessments at baseline, and at 18-, 36-, 54-, and 72-month follow-ups. Four cognitive composite scores were computed: the ADCS-PACC (ADCS-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite), ADCS-PACC without the inclusion of the mini-mental state examination \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:1zNUifcpCKoC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2733489276154057171", "cites_id": ["2733489276154057171"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352872915000871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:05GAlgNO7yUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 15, "2020": 13, "2021": 16, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
