Hence, the interplay between risk factors for vascular disease and development of dementia is of great interest, because many vascular risk factors (VRF) are amenable to intervention. We used longitudinal A\u03b2 PET imaging to identify whether VRF factors were associated with increased accumulation of A\u03b2 over six years\u2019 follow-up.Methods140 cognitively-normal participants from the AIBL Study underwent 11 C-PiB and 18 F-NAV PET imaging at 18-monthly intervals over six years. Only participants with three or more PET assessments were included in the analysis. Linear mixed models regression was performed for A\u03b2 SUVR (dependent variable) and number of VRF (sum of Hypertension, Hypercholesterolaemia, Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity, Smoking), Framingham Coronary Risk Profile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:8s_vhd3wPlUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.07.441", "cites_per_year": {}}
