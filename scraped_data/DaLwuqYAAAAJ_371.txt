While AIBL participants underwent A\u03b2 imaging with PiB and NAV4694 (n= 220, median follow-up of 4.8\u2013range 2.5\u201310.6\u2013years), or flutemetamol (n= 94, median follow-up of 3.2\u2013range 3.0\u20133.8\u2013years), ADNI participants underwent A\u03b2 imaging with florbetapir (n= 171, median follow-up of 4.1\u2013range 2.9\u20135.7\u2013years). A\u03b2 deposition was derived from the slope of the linear regression plots, and rates of accumulation were calculated from the time it took to go from the median levels of A\u03b2-HC to the median levels of A\u03b2+ AD, and they were expressed as both SUVR and Centiloids (CL).ResultsOf 485 initial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Jxy3h8XkNu0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.07.661", "cites_per_year": {}}
