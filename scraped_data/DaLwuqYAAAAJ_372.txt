Follow-up scans at 18 and 36 months were obtained in 107 participants. Results were expressed as Centiloids (CL), generated using the CL cortical and whole cerebellum masks. Rates of A\u03b2 deposition were derived from the slope of the linear regression plots of those participants with three studies. Change was expressed as the yearly rates of A\u03b2 accumulaton or as yearly% difference from baseline.ResultsAt 36-month follow-up, positive rates of A\u03b2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:S_0nULq340kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.1044", "cites_per_year": {}}
