While MR-based quantification remains the gold standard, there is great interest in PET-only quantification techniques. We evaluate 3 PET-only methods and compare them to MR-based quantification in both AIBL and ADNI.Methods18F-AV1451 and MR images from AIBL (n= 94) and ADNI (n= 87) were used. The pons was used for SUVR normalisation. Global SUVR was defined as the mean of the 3 ROIs from the MeTeR scale (Mesial-temporal (Me), Temporoparietal (Te) and Rest of neocortex (R)). Global SUVR was measured using MR images and 3 PET-only methods: spatial normalisation to a mean PET atlas; adaptive PET atlas based on the linear combination of a negative and positive atlases \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:LdOr7sPPAccC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.2550", "cites_per_year": {}}
