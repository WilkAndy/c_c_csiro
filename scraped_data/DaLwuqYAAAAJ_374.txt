Epidemiological research indicates that veterans with TBI are 2\u20134 times more likely to develop dementia than controls; however, mechanisms contributing to this relationship are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate if Vietnam war veterans without mild cognitive impairment or dementia, but with TBI show evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological markers, as assessed by A\u03b2-amyloid, tau and glucose metabolism using PET, alongside neuropsychological testing.MethodsFifty-five male participants-29 veterans with TBI (aged 68.1\u00b12.25 years) and 24 veteran controls (aged 69.6\u00b15.29 years)-underwent neuropsychological assessment, FDG, tau (18 F-AV1451) and Ab-amyloid PET (18 F-Florbetaben \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_sLlIXX7spQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.405", "cites_per_year": {}}
