While a cross-sectional assessment of these biomarkers provides information regarding the presence/absence of disease, investigation of these biomarkers at the earliest stages of the disease might provide prognostic information about disease progression. Such biomarker investigations are key to understanding their importance earlier in the pathological process.MethodsWe assessed correlations (Spearman's Rho (r)) between CSF (total-tau (T-tau), phosphorylated-tau (P-tau181P), A\u03b2 1\u201342 and the T-tau/A\u03b2 1\u201342 ratio) and MRI biomarkers (hippocampal and gray matter volumes) from 111 Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) participants at first follow up, 36 at second \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:nFloTcPoiwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.432", "cites_per_year": {}}
