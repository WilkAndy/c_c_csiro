These functions have long been associated with the integrity of the frontal lobe. While neuroimaging studies have frequently reported correlations between objective lab-based EF tasks and activity in diverse brain structures, the relationship between everyday naturalistic EF and regional brain activity has been less well-studied. We aim to evaluate the relationships between naturalistic \u201creal-world\u201d behavioral ratings of EF and resting state regional brain activity.MethodsParticipants were 80 (26M) healthy older adults (average 69.13, SD 8.70) and their informants (usually their spouse). We used Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale (FrSBe) to obtain ratings of subjects\u2019 EF dysfunction symptoms from the informant, which produces three subscales of EF syndromes (the Apathic, Disinhibited \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RiW20FJDrgsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.2378", "cites_per_year": {}}
