We assessed the predictive power of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches of neuroimaging measures of A\u03b2-pathology, brain volumetrics, and what predictive information can be derived from the combination of these markers. With the advent of tau imaging, we also tested the performance of neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers against the new proposed categorical classification that combines measures of A\u03b2, tau, and neuronal injury. Finally, we tested the performance of blood surrogate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:He_SdS2HmmMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.07.015", "cites_per_year": {}}
