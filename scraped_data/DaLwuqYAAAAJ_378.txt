However, the hippocampus is a heterogeneous brain structure composed of various subfields with distinct histological characteristics that can now be accurately segmented thanks to new developments in high field MRI. Due to their differential anatomy and functionality, some of these hippocampal subfields (HS) have been shown to be specifically associated with AD with higher sensitivity than HV. This study investigates the age-related changes in the volume of HS as well as the entorhinal cortex in cognitively healthy elderly.MethodsThirty-two cognitively healthy elderly individuals (aged 67\u00b18, 62% Males) underwent a turbo spin echo 7T MRI scan on two different sites using the same sequence and same scanner model. The hippocampus subfields were segmented with ASHS software based on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:1In3SbHwanAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.06.2387", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c7D3A6WGduYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
