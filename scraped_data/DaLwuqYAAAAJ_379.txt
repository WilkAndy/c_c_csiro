Studies have demonstrated 11 C-PiB to have the strongest correlation with CSF A\u03b2 1\u201342, CSF total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and the T-tau/A\u03b2 1\u201342 ratio.MethodsUsing data from the AIBL study, we assessed the correlation and agreement between neocortical tau and A\u03b2 PET, between PET tau and CSF P-tau and T-tau, and lastly between A\u03b2 PET and CSF-A\u03b2 1\u201342, CSF T-tau and CSF P-tau by PET tracer. CSF measures were expressed as ng/L. In order to combine results from different tracers, neocortical A\u03b2 PET results were expressed as SUVR/BeCKeT, while neocortical tau PET results were expressed as z-score.ResultsThe strongest correlation for PET vs CSF biomarker was between A\u03b2 SUVR (PiB) and the T-tau/A\u03b2 1\u201342 ratio (r= 0.74, p< 0.0001 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:gFcjaLVeiroC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2017.07.067", "cites_per_year": {}}
