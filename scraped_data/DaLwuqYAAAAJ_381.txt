Two-hundred-and-three participants (149 controls; 34 MCI; 20 AD) were evaluated at enrolment and every 18 months for a mean follow-up of 4.9 (range 2.5-10.6) years. A 1.4 PiB SUVR (25 Centiloids -CL-) was used to discriminate between high (A\u03b2+) from low (A\u03b2-) A\u03b2 burdens. Rates of A\u03b2 deposition were derived from the slope of the linear regression plots. Irrespective of their A\u03b2 status, participants with a positive rate of A\u03b2 deposition, deemed to be on the \u201cAD-pathway,\u201d were used for the analyses. The same approach was used to establish the rates of A\u03b2 accumulation as assessed by 18F-flutemetamol, 18F-florbetapir, and 18F-florbetaben At baseline, significantly higher global A\u03b2 burdens were observed in AD (2.3\u00b10.4 SUVR/91\u00b126 CL) and MCI (2.0\u00b10.7 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:H1aCVKaixnMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/58/supplement_1/560.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
