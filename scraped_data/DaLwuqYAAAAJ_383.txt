We developed and implemented a stereospecific approach to generate both continuous and categorical measures that reflect tau spreading and deposition as assessed by different tau tracers, in order to make results from tau imaging studies accessible and easy to translate into research and clinical practice. Two hundred and thirty four participants underwent A\u03b2 and tau imaging studies. A\u03b2 burden was assessed using 18F-florbetapir, 18F-flutemetamol or 18F-NAV4694. Global and regional tau burden were assessed using either 18F-AV1451, 18F-THK5317, 18F-THK5351 or 18F-MK6420, using the cerebellar cortex as reference region.
