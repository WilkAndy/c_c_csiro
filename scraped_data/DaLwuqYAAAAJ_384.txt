We pay respects to the Elders past and present. Since 2002, ISBI has been bringing together world experts from the biomedical imaging fields to present their work aimed at using biomedical imaging for improving diagnosis, screening disorders, and to better understand diseases. Biomedical imaging is a key source of information for managing health and generates increasingly large datasets. In this age of Big Data, the ISBI conference is a unique opportunity to present new ideas and contributions towards developing technologies to improve health outcomes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:L2Pn6qttGKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7950443/", "cites_per_year": {}}
