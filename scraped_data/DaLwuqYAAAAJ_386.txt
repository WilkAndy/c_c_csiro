It is unclear whether this occurs solely through APOE \u025b4 increasing amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) accumulation or through processes independent of A\u03b2.Objective: To determine the extent and nature to which APOE \u025b4 increases risk for clinical disease progression in CN older adults.Methods: Data from the total (n= 765) and A\u03b2-imaged (n= 423) CN cohort in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models to estimate \u025b4 risk for clinical disease progression over a 72-month follow-up.Results: With A\u03b2 status unknown and risk from demographic characteristics controlled, \u025b4 carriage increased risk for clinical disease progression over 72 months by 2.66 times compared to risk of non-\u025b4 carriage. Re-analysis with A\u03b2 status included showed that abnormally high A\u03b2 increased risk for clinical disease progression over 72 months by 2.11 times compared to risk of low A\u03b2. However, with A\u03b2 level known, \u025b4 carriage was no longer predictive of clinical disease progression.Conclusion: In CN older adults, the risk of \u025b4 for clinical disease progression occurs through the effect of \u025b4 increasing A\u03b2 levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:CrVLTnlDqZQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworkspost2013/2704/", "cites_per_year": {}}
