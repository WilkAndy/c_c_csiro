Importantly, a subset, usually referred to as super-agers (SA; Rogalski, et al., 2013, J Cog Neurosc, 25: 29-36) live to an old age whilst continuing to maintain cognitive function at levels similar to demographically-matched peers at least 20-30 years their junior. The current study reports trajectories of change in cortical thickness on a well-defined group of SAs vs. typical agers (TA) followed longitudinally over six years in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers & Lifestyle Study (AIBL) (Ellis et al., 2009, Int Psychogeriat, 2: 672-87).  Methods Super-Agers were defined as individuals aged 60+ who scored in the normative range for individuals aged 30 \u2013 44 on the CVLT-II, a test of verbal episodic memory, at baseline and two consecutive time-points 18 months apart.
