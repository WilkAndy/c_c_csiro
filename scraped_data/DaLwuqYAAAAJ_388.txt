The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between self-reported exercise levels and brain amyloid load, in a cohort of individuals known to be carriers of genetic mutations that cause autosomal dominant Alzheimer\u2019s disease (ADAD). Methods: Data from 139 presymptomatic mutation carriers (MC; in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2) of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) were available for inclusion in these analyses. Habitual exercise level was categorised into less than 150 minutes per week (low exercise) or 150 minutes per week and above (high exercise), based on current recommended guidelines. Brain amyloid load was quantified by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB PET). The cohort was then stratified by a pre-defined cut-off of brain amyloid levels in order to investigate those with high brain amyloid load (PiB+). Results: Compared to the MC high exercise group, the MC low exercise group was older (38.6 years versus 33.7 years) and had more depressive symptoms (measured by the geriatric depression scale; 2.2 versus 1.4). No differences in brain amyloid load were observed between the MC low exercise and the MC high exercise groups. Nevertheless, PiB+ MC low exercisers (n= 16), had higher mean levels of brain amyloid than PiB+ MC high exercisers (n= 55, F= 7 $74, p= 0 $007). Furthermore, the interaction between exercise group* estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) was a significant predictor of brain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:B4wWq2ztVNgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/121938/", "cites_per_year": {}}
