We investigated whether individuals with memory problems and additional cerebrovascular risk factors (CVD) could increase PA in the short-term and maintain adherence to a PA program in the long-term. We also examined factors influencing PA adherence. Methods: The AIBL Active trial recruited participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective memory complaints (SMC) and at least 1 CVD risk factor from The Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging (AIBL). They were randomly assigned to a control or PA group. The control group continued their usual PA throughout the study. The PA group was given a 24-month home-based program with a target of 150 minutes/week of moderate PA and a behavioral intervention. Scheduled group-specific phone calls (n\u00bc18) and newsletters (n\u00bc17) were administered to both groups over 24 months. The PA group recorded sessions in diaries and adherence was calculated from the number of sessions recorded expressed as the percentage of the sessions prescribed. At baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months participants completed fitness (6-minute walk distance); PA and PA self-efficacy (one\u2019s confidence to be physically active) questionnaires; cognitive and health assessments.  Results: The adherence results for the PA group (n\u00bc55) comprising of 53% women are reported. At baseline 24% were defined as inactive; men were significantly older than women; 74.7(6SD 5.6) versus 70.1(4.8) years respectively. Five participants did not start the intervention. After 24 months 96% were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:x9X1S-hd97YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/121937/", "cites_per_year": {}}
