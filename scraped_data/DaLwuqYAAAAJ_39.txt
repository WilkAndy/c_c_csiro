While the framework prescribes SPM8 as the standard analysis method for PET quantification, non-standard methods can be calibrated to produce centiloid values. We have previously developed a PET-only quantification: CapAIBL. In this study, we show how CapAIBL can be calibrated to the centiloid scale.Calibration images for 11C-PiB, 18F-NAV4694, 18F-Florbetaben, 18F-Flutemetamol and 18F- Florbetapir were analysed using the standard method and CapAIBL. Using these images, both methods were calibrated to the centiloid scale. Centiloid values computed using CapAIBL were compared to those computed using standard method. For each tracer, a separate validation was performed using an independent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:lRnoeYR1YAAC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8353882936507544757", "cites_id": ["8353882936507544757"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918307420", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tbS6HUX07nMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 21, "2022": 33, "2023": 18}}
