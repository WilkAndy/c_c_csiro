Yet despite the insights into disease that kinetic analysis offers, it is not used clinically and seldom used in research beyond the preclinical stage. The utility of PET kinetic analysis is hampered by several factors including spatial inconsistency within regions of homogeneous tissue and relative computational expense when fitting complex models to individual voxels. Even with sophisticated algorithms inconsistencies can arise because local optima frequently have narrow basins of convergence, are surrounded by relatively flat (uninformative) regions, have relatively low-gradient valley floors, or combinations thereof. Based on the observation that cost functions for individual voxels frequently bear some resemblance to each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:JmU_-KX0ghQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841516300974", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GaOn_khV_SoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
