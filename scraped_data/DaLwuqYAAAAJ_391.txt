The development of new PET ligands selective for tau now allows in vivo investigation of this association.MethodsSixty-one participants underwent Tau imaging with 18 F-AV1451 (54-HC, 6-MCI, 1-AD) and forty-three others with 18 F-THK5351 (22-HC, 15-MCI, 6-AD). All participants received an MRI scan. Three tau masks corresponding to different Braak&Braak stages were constructed: Mesial-temporal (Me), Temporoparietal (Te) and Rest (R) of the neocortex. Tau and A\u03b2 PET scans were quantified using CapAIBL\u00ae. Tracer retention was measured in the three masks and normalized with three standard reference regions: cerebellar cortex, pons and whole cerebellum. A threshold was established for each mask and tau tracer.
