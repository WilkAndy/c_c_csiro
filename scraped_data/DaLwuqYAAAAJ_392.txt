This study aims to investigate the effect of the MAPT allele and its interaction with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), on cortical thickness, hippocampal volume, and rates of atrophy.MethodsAs part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing, 286 HC, 58 MCI and 36 AD underwent MRI and A\u03b2 PET scans (either PiB or flutemetamol). HC received follow-up scans every 18 months for up to 6 years. A\u03b2 scans were scaled and normalised using CapAIBL\u00ae At baseline, participants were classified as having either high or low A\u03b2 burden using a threshold equivalent to 1.4 SUVR (\u223c 16.5 centiloids). In addition to APOE genotyping, MAPT H1/H2 status was determined through genotyping \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:J2VLEJC5QowC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.1408", "cites_per_year": {}}
