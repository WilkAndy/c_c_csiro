The aim of this study was to investigate if Vietnam war veterans without mild cognitive impairment or dementia, but with chronic combat related PTSD show evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathological markers, as assessed by amyloid, tau and glucose metabolism using PET.MethodsSixty-seven male participants-30 veterans with chronic PTSD (aged 67.9\u00b12.6 years) and 37 controls (aged 74.3\u00b18.3 years)-underwent both tau and amyloid PET imaging scans with 18 F-AV1451 and 18 F-florbetaben or 18 F-flutemetamol, respectively. Fifty-two of these participants (24 PTSD, 28 NC) also underwent 18 F-FDG. While 18 F-AV1451 SUVR was calculated using the cerebellar cortex \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RL3Vt95MvH0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.1396", "cites_per_year": {}}
