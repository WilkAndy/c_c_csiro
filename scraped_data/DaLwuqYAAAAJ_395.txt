In vivo quantification of A\u03b2 deposition in the brain is now possible using several PET tracers, but the high cost of PET scanning is a challenge. This study investigates several recruitment strategies to minimize the cost of recruiting 100 A\u03b2 positive healthy elderlies.MethodsSubjects older than 60 from the AIBL study were used. Amyloid PET scan (AU $2000) was considered the ground truth to identify individuals with abnormally high A\u03b2 brain level, thus assuming perfect sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%). Three strategies were considered to recruit 100 individuals. 1) Subjects were recruited and were scanned with PET until reaching the targeted cohort size (100); 2) a blood test (AU $100) was used to screen those \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KG521SxztIwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.059", "cites_per_year": {}}
