The extent to which A\u03b2+ and BDNF Val66Met is related to circulating markers of BDNF (eg, serum) is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of A\u03b2+ and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on levels of serum mature BDNF (mBDNF), EM and HV volume at baseline and over 18-months in non-demented older adults.MethodsNon-demented older adults (n= 446) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent A\u03b2 neuroimaging and BDNF Val66Met genotyping. EM and HV were assessed at baseline and 18-months later. Fasted blood samples were obtained from each participant at baseline and at 18-month \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:IZcclEPD2KUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.1967", "cites_per_year": {}}
