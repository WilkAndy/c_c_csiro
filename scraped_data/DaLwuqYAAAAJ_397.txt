The extent to which neurodegenerative disease and DAT can occur in MCi with low AB (A\u03b2-) is unknown. The aim of this study was to follow prospectively changes in cognition and hippocampal volume over 36 months in A\u03b2-and A\u03b2+ adults with MCI.Methods87 older adults who were classified on the clinical dementia rating scale with a score of 0.5 underwent PET amyloid neuroimaging. On this the basis of this individuals with MCI (CDR= 0.5) were classified as A\u03b2+(n= 50) or A\u03b2-(n= 37).
