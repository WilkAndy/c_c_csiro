We aimed to determine the extent to which high A\u03b2 amyloid influenced cognitive function in healthy older adults and adults with MCI. Method: Healthy controls (HC; n= 178) and adults with MCI (n= 56) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study, underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging for A\u03b2 amyloid and completed an extensive neuropsychological battery, assessing the cognitive domains of verbal and visual episodic memory, executive function, visuoconstruction, attention and processing speed, and language at baseline. Results: MCI with low A\u03b2 performed worse than MCI with high A\u03b2 on measures of executive function, attention, visuoconstruction and language. No differences were observed between HC high and low A\u03b2 groups. When compared with HC with low A\u03b2, both MCI high and low A\u03b2 groups performed worse on measures of episodic memory. However, only the MCI low A\u03b2 group performed worse than HC low A\u03b2 on measures of executive function, attention, visuoconstruction, and language. Conclusions: When compared with HC with low A\u03b2 amyloid, MCI with high A\u03b2 amyloid present with impairments restricted to episodic memory, and the episodic memory impairments in MCI with low A\u03b2 amyloid were accompanied by impairments in executive function, attention, visuoconstruction, and language, suggesting that MCI with high A\u03b2 amyloid reflects prodromal AD, although \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0xcHesCNKywC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian-Kamer-2/amp", "cites_per_year": {}}
