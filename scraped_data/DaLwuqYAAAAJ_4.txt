AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 546, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17691571928525795345", "cites_id": ["17691571928525795345"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911012092", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EXANXu8WhfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 21, "2014": 27, "2015": 29, "2016": 41, "2017": 43, "2018": 45, "2019": 57, "2020": 60, "2021": 77, "2022": 89, "2023": 26}}
