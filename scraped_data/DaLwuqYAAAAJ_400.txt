The uniformity of structural networks inferred from diffusion tensor imaging across different individuals is however, unknown. This paper presents a method to infer group-wise consistent structural clusters from the connectome Laplacian graph. The spectral clustering of the cortical networks from diffusion tensor imaging was applied on 146 healthy subjects using 3 random groups, and on groups based on gender and age, to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results show six consistent sub-networks of structural connections that was validated using known cluster validity indices, showing highly reproducible clusters for random groups and groups based on gender; while, cluster differences were observed between younger and older groups in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:i_acAUMCj1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7493409/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TBBWHkrFEpEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
