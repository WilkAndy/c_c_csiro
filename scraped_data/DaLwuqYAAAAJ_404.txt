Access to simulators can be difficult and costly. A new high definition laptop based training tool (The Circular Checklist, CCL) has been developed. It simulates the experience of moving around the bronchial tree in a sequential fashion using the Boyden classification of bronchial naming. Subjects must sequentially name and move into bronchial openings before moving on to the next bronchus, starting at B1 and finishing at B10 on each side.  Methods: At a bronchoscopy training school, a prospective study was conducted with informed consent of participants. Trainees who had bronchoscopy experience were new to the Boyden classification, which were divided into two groups after stratification based on anatomy knowledge. After a bronchoscopic anatomy lecture, Group 1 was given 1\u2009h to train on the CCL, completing all tasks and then assessed on a low fidelity bronchoscopy model with a real bronchoscope, using the Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (B STAT). Group 2 had no such training but had the BSAT. BSTAT tests at each point were done in duplicate with the second test reported. Then there was a cross over with Group 2 having CCL training and both groups had repeat BSTAT. Maximum score on BSTAT is 42.  Results: Nineteen subjects completed the CCL training and did both sets of assessment. Group 2 showed a significant learning gain. Group 1 results were on the whole better after their first CCL training. Subjects found the CCL easy to use and had high satisfaction from the training.
