In addition, subjective memory complaints (SMC) might be a first clinical expression of the effect of AD pathology on cognitive functioning. Objective: To assess whether APOE \u025b4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory are risk factors for high amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) burden in cognitively normal elderly. Methods: 307 cognitively normal participants (72.7\u00b16.8 years, 53% female, 55% SMC) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent amyloid PET and APOE genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of APOE \u025b4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory with A\u03b2 pathology. Results: Odds of high A\u03b2 burden were greater at an older age (OR= 3.21; 95% CI= 1.68\u20136.14), when SMC were present (OR= 1.90; 95% CI= 1.03\u20133.48), and for APOE \u025b4 carriers (OR= 7.49; 95% CI= 3.96\u201314.15), while episodic memory was not associated with odds of high A\u03b2 burden. Stratified analyses showed that odds of SMC for high A\u03b2 burden were increased in specifically APOE \u025b4 carriers (OR= 4.58, 95% CI= 1.83\u201311.49) and younger participants (OR= 3.73, 95% CI= 1.39\u201310.01). Conclusion: Aging, APOE \u025b4 genotype, and SMC were associated with high A\u03b2 burden. SMC were especially indicative of high A\u03b2 burden in younger participants and in APOE \u025b4 carriers. These findings suggest that selection based on the presence of SMC, APOE \u025b4 genotype and age may help identify healthy elderly participants with high A\u03b2 burden eligible for secondary prevention trials."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:8Wa-k36u3iwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworkspost2013/2641/", "cites_per_year": {}}
