This project aims to understand the barriers and enablers to knowledge translation in aged care homes for the implementation of vitamin D supplements for fall prevention.Methods: A literature review on interventions focused on the implementation of vitamin D supplements in aged care homes was conducted. Factors influencing implementation were also considered by an expert advisory group, who were consulted over an 18 month planning period.Results: Ten studies were identified that have focused on the implementation of vitamin D supplements. Evidence for the effectiveness of implementation strategies is inconclusive, with a general consensus for the use of multifaceted interventions that include strategies such as education, audit and feedback and appointing a champion. It is clear that the attitudes and beliefs of relevant stakeholders, and organisational readiness and capacity for change are pivotal for the success of implementation. The experience with the expert advisory group and with partner organisations was instructive in that there is resistance to implementation of vitamin D supplements despite clear guideline evidence supporting this.Conclusions: While there is limited evidence for effective knowledge translation in this setting, it is clear that there will be no \u2018one size fits all\u2019answer. Although the evidence for vitamin D supplement use in this population is strong, the individual contexts of aged care homes must be understood to develop and implement a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:GGgVawPscysC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/110857/", "cites_per_year": {}}
