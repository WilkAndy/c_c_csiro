The 150 min a week of at least moderate intensity activity has been mainstream public health recommendation for PA, including for older adults. This study describes the pattern of PA in a group of non-demented older adults with memory complaints and examines whether they achieve the suggested targets.Methods:  Cross-sectional baseline PA data over a week were collected in 108 volunteers with clinical risk factors for chronic disease participating in the AIBL Active study. Self reported questionnaire (CHAMPS), pedometer records and functional tests were examined.Results:  Close to 60% of women and 80% of men were overweight or obese and the pattern varied with age. More men met clinical classification of metabolic syndrome (35% vs 23%) with women showing less abdominal obesity and better lipid profiles. About 64% met the PA guideline of 150 min/week. Pedometer records indicated that most performed 3000\u201310,000 steps/day while 16% achieved >10,000 steps/day. Men achieved higher total caloric expenditure/week (p < 0.05). Both sex reported minimal participation in vigorous activity. The guideline adherence was not associated with BMI categories or clinical risk factors.Conclusion:  While our participants find it challenging to meet adequate PA targets, these findings are comparable to that of the general older Australians."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0oeUc68sgesC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/110858/", "cites_per_year": {}}
