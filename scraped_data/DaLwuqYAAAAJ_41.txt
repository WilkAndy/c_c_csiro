Ablation of the astrocytic end-feet expressed water-channel protein, Aquaporin-4, in mice, results in impairment of this clearance mechanism and increased brain A\u03b2-amyloid deposition, suggesting that Aquaporin-4 plays a pivotal role in glymphatic function. Currently there is a paucity of literature regarding the impact of AQP4 genetic variation on sleep, brain A\u03b2-amyloid burden and their relationship to each other in humans. To address this a cross-sectional observational study was undertaken in cognitively normal older adults from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Genetic variants in AQP4 were investigated with respect to self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index sleep parameters, positron emission tomography derived brain A\u03b2-amyloid burden and whether \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:pOP5Rf-i_loC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12228861586049772403", "cites_id": ["12228861586049772403"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0094-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c6vqO9KktakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 6, "2019": 11, "2020": 16, "2021": 20, "2022": 20, "2023": 13}}
