While a few studies have investigated the changes in rCBF in prodromal AD, no study to date has used MRI to identify CBF differences between healthy controls (HC) with high or low A\u03b2 burdens, while only one PET study [Sojkova, et al. 2008] has done so using 15 OH 2 O PET. The current study investigated the association between A\u03b2 and rCBF in preclinical AD using state of the art multiphase pseudo-continuous ASL (MP-PCASL).Methods41 HC underwent PiB-PET and MP-PCASL as part of the AIBL study. A\u03b2 status was determined using CapAIBL\u00a9, while rCBF was computed using an in-house processing pipeline comprising of motion correction, spatial and temporal denoising, partial volume correction and quantification. rCBF values were adjusted for age.ResultsBased on a cut-off value of 1.5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:83UE6yvegO4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.08.095", "cites_per_year": {}}
