This study aims to determine if BDNF polymorphism has a similar effect on other cortical regions vulnerable to A\u03b2.MethodsAs part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of ageing, 70 HC underwent MRI and A\u03b2 PET scans (either PiB or flutemetamol) every 18 months for up to 6 years. A\u03b2 scans were scaled and normalised using CapAIBL\u00ae. At baseline, participants were classified as having either high (A\u03b2+) or low A\u03b2 burden (A\u03b2-). Genotyping for ApoE4 and BDNF polymorphism (rs6265) was performed through a custom Illumina GoldenGate assay. Hippocampal volumes and cortical thickness were measured with MilxView\u00ae at different time-points and atrophy rates were averaged in cortical regions vulnerable to A\u03b2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:-1RNHcZo4Y8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.07.182", "cites_per_year": {}}
