In this study, we try to identify the pattern of cortical grey matter (GM) atrophy in cognitively unimpaired healthy elderly controls (HC) when hippocampal volume is used to define neurodegeneration, and ascertain if this pattern is different in those with or without AD pathology.Methods320 cognitively unimpaired subjects were assessed using PET (PiB, flutemetamol or florbetapir) and MRI as part of the AIBL study. A\u03b2 status (A) was determined using CapAIBL\u00a9, while neurodegeneration (N) was established using hippocampal volume (HV) measured with FreeSurfer. Following Jack et al,(2012, 2013) subjects were categorized as AN-, A+ N-, A+ N+, or A-N+(SNAP).
