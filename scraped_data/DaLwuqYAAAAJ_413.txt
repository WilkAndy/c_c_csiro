A\u03b2 status (A) was determined with either PiB, flutemetamol or florbetapir, while neurodegeneration (N) was established using hippocampal volume. Following Jack et al (2012) individuals were categorized as either A-N-, A+N-, A+N+, or suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology (SNAP, A-N+). Clinical progression, cognitive domain-specific trajectories, global composite scores, and brain volumetrics were assessed64% of HC were classified as A-N-, 18% as A+N-, 6% as A+N+, and 12% as A-N+. Participants in the A-N- group were significantly younger, and while males were more prevalent among A+N+ and A-N+, females were more prevalent among \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:3yMDF_cvnR8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/56/supplement_3/610.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
