There is a growing interest in identifying structural and functional neuro-anatomical correlates of the disorder that has the potential to predict early behavioural assessment impacting tailored rehabilitation intervention. In this study we analyse the diffusion MRI of ASD and developmental delay (DD) infants below 36 months of age and compare the differences in neural pathways using network based statistics. Further we analyse the asymmetry between the two cohorts from the obtained neural pathways."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:9fSugHr6AN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2015/1266.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
