Cortical thickness estimation (CTE) is commonly estimated using T1-weighted, MPRAGE sequence. The recent MP2RAGE sequence has been proposed with lower intensity inhomogeneity and increased tissue contrast. This abstract compares CTE with MPRAGE and MP2RAGE using a test-retest experiment. A bias between MPRAGE and MP2RAGE was found and could be corrected by a new partial volume model. MP2RAGE was found to be more reproducible than MPRAGE and should therefore be considered for measuring cortical thickness in clinical studies. MP2RAGE was found to be more reproducible than CTE with MPRAGE."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:7fE6T6CK6bcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2015/3505.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
