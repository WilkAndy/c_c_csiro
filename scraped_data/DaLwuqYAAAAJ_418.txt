Kinetic analysis at the voxel scale remains expensive even with recent formulations relying on the closed form summation of convolution of exponentials. This work proposes a scheme to accelerate the kinetic analysis of large populations of time activity curves, by selectively sharing tailored simplex optimisations between them. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the approach not only accelerates kinetic analysis, but maintains equivalent or better fitting accuracy than existing approaches that optimise time activity curves individually."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:afceBpUbn5YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-18431-9_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kTyJrvN16goJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
