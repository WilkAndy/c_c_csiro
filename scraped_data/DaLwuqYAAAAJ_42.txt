Unfortunately due to a lack of validated biomarkers definitive diagnosis relies on the histological demonstration of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. A\u03b2 processing is implicated in AD progression and many therapeutic strategies target various aspects of this biology. While A\u03b2 deposition is the most prominent feature of AD, oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 have been implicated as the toxic species inducing the neuronal dysfunction. Currently there are no methods allowing routine monitoring of levels of such species in living populations. We have used surface enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry incorporating antibody capture to investigate whether the cellular membrane-containing fraction of blood provides a new source of biomarkers. There are significant differences in the mass spectra \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4814334468992028257", "cites_id": ["4814334468992028257"], "pub_url": "https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/18/6315.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YU4wLrHzz0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 10, "2012": 13, "2013": 13, "2014": 18, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
