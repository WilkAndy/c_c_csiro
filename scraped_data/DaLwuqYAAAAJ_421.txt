The relationship between SMC, Apolipoprotein E-e4 allele (e4) status and A\u03b2-burden was compared in two healthy control (HC) cohorts in the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of ageing (AIBL).Methods134 new HC (age 74.4\u00b15.6) AIBL participants were recently imaged with 18 F-flutemetamol (flute) and compared to the 177 HC (age 73.6\u00b17.6) AIBL baseline participants imaged with 11 C-PiB (PiB). e4 was present in 43% of the PiB cohort and 26% of the flute cohort while 54% of the PIB and 65% flute HC were classed as SMC by an affirmative answer to the question \u201cDo you have difficulty with your memory?\u201d and normal for age psychometric scores. PET images were acquired 90-110 mins post-injection of 18 F \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:xO3Y8ErbwlsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.04.212", "cites_per_year": {}}
