For visual inspection of the images, cortical surface based visualisation presents the advantage of providing a compact and more convenient display than volumetric scans. We have developed an automated reporting tool to display the semiquantitative PET signal for several common tracers without the need of a MRI and using several standard normalisation methods (ie using the Pons, the whole Cerebellum WCB and the cerebellum cortex CB-CTX). This tool is available on-line to registered users and the processing is performed remotely (http://milxcloud. csiro. au/capaibl). The method was validated by comparing the surface signal computed with and without MRI.MethodsThree hundred and thirty nine participants from the AIBL cohort \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:JZsVLox4iN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.016", "cites_per_year": {}}
