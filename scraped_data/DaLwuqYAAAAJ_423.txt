Vascular disease risk factors increase risk for dementia, however whether this is synergistic or additive to concurrent AD-pathology is unclear.Methods287 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing, ranging from normal cognition through MCI to AD dementia, assessed four times over 54 months with 11C-PiB PET, 3T-MRI and neuropsychology assessment. 174 also had SWI MRI for microbleeds and 80 had carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement. Linear mixed models regression was used to compare outcome (cognitive score, PET SUVR, atrophy) between groups with and without significant PiB and CVD burden over time. Subanalyses also tested whether greater carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or lobar microbleeds (LMB \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KmkpU35IWjAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.05.026", "cites_per_year": {}}
