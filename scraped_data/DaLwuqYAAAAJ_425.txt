The major contributions are: identifying microbleed extent in order to extract proper cubic regions-of-interest (ROI) containing the structure, (2) extracting a set of robust 3- dimensional (3D) Radon- and Hessian-based shape descriptors within the ROIs as well as 2D Radon features computed on intensity-projection images of the corresponding ROIs, and (3) incorporating a cascade of random forests (RF) classifiers to iteratively reduce false detection rates while maintaining a high sensitivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Ncwx4PHgTB8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-00989923/", "cites_per_year": {}}
