Methods: 207 participants (152 HC; 36 MCI; 19 AD) underwent periodic neuropsychological examination, MRI and PiB-PET scans for a mean follow up of 4.2 (CI 3.4-4.8) years. A SUVR cb of 1.5 was used to discriminate high (Ab+) from low (Ab-) Ab burdens. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, years of education, and ApoE status. Results: 170 (82%) of the 207 participants (79% HC, 89% MCI, 100% AD), were deemed Ab accumulators. In HC and MCI, Ab deposition and memory decline were significantly faster in Ab+ than in Ab-. Ab deposition was significantly faster in participants who transitioned to either MCI or AD, although baseline Ab burden was a better predictor of progression. Significant associations between rates of Ab deposition and rates of episodic memory (EM) decline were found in HC (R 2= 0.14; p= 0.009). There were no associations between Ab deposition and EM decline in MCI or AD. When Ab+ HC and Ab-HC were considered separately, a significant association between rates of Ab deposition and EM decline was found only in Ab+ HC (R 2= 0.31; p= 0.013), association that persisted after adjusting for baseline Ab-burden. There was no association between rates of Ab deposition and EM decline in Ab-HC, not even when those with positive rates of Ab accumulation were examined separately. Conclusions: Ab seems to play a threshold/trigger effect on EM at the early stages of Ab deposition.
