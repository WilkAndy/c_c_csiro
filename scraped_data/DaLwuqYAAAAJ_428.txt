We hypothesize that because FOD resolves the crossing fibres, it will allow measuring genetic influence on intra-voxel fibre structures. We estimated the heritability of FOD measures over a twin cohort, by projecting the heritability of FOD onto fibre tracks, and estimating the genetic influence along fibre tracks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:9xDRhSErrBIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2014/0054.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
