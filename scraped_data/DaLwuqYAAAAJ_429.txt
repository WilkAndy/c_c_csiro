We propose an automated detection of cortical/sub-cortical regions that are associated with PSD. The method involves pairwise comparison of network connectivity matrices between normal and stroke patients using diffusion tractography and network based statistics to identify the networks affected by ischemic stroke. Then a groupwise linear regression analysis is performed between the loss-in-connectivity in each brain region and the respective patients' depression scores at 3 month post-stroke stage. The results revealed positive correlations between loss-in-connectivity and PSD in some brain regions including the thalamus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:UuaQgmrAG1sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2014/2585.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
