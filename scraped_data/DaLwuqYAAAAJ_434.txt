Degeneration of axons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often detected using surrogate MRI measures for white matter'integrity'(eg Fractional Anisotropy, FA). These measures are based entirely on image intensity and discard useful information provided by morphology. Morphology information is pertinent to investigating AD, as cellular debris is cleared after degeneration and axon loss largely manifests as white matter atrophy.MethodsWe applied a new diffusion MRI measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD)[1] to compare 46 AD patients with 94 age-matched healthy volunteers (Australian Imaging Biomarkers & Lifestyle study). AFD is proportional to the image intensity, which is related to the quantity of intra-axonal water, and is therefore sensitive to the number of axons \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.05.144", "cites_per_year": {}}
