In this study we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the degeneration of the BF and its relationship to amyloid level as measured with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET, and hippocampal atrophy.MethodsFrom the AIBL study, longitudinal PiB and T1W MRI images of AD, mild cognitive impaired (MCI) and healthy control (HC) subjects from two time points (baseline: 156 HC, 40 MCI, 38 AD subjects; 18 month: 133 HC, 22 MCI, 19 AD) were used. From the ADNI study, T1W MRI images of 26 HC, 94 MCI and 9 AD were used. A BF mask was delineated using published coordinates of the BF and constrained to areas that undergo atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (when comparing HC and AD subjects), resulting in a BF mask of AD-specific change.
