Due to the limited structural information in PET images, automatic tissue-specific assessment is usually performed with the aid of MR images, which may not always be available. We evaluated a novel MR-less method to locally estimate and project the cortical tracer retention on a common surface template.MethodsSeveral subjects were scanned with different radiotracers: 18 F-Flutemetamol, 18 F-Florbetapir, 18 F-Florbetaben, 11 C-PIB, 18 F-NAV4694 and 18 F-FDG. First, each individual PET image was normalised in the MNI space and SUVR scaled with a common cortical cerebellum mask. Radiotracer retention was then estimated within several GM prior atlases. On scans acquired on a PET/CT scanner, CT was used to estimate the GM priors.
