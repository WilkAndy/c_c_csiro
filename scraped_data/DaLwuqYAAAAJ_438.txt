Individuals were classified as NC (n= 97), or mild cognitive impairment MCI (n= 37). MB and strokes were identified by consensus of two blinded readers. PiB SUVR were dichotomized into high (PiB+) and low (PiB-) A\u03b2-burden using a 1.5 SUVR threshold. 3 Clinical ratings were performed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.04.066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zMARdC0c5wAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
