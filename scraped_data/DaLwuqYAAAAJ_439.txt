However, derangements of metabolic connectivity are intimately related to b-amyloid plaque burden. In order to assess the specific alterations in metabolic connectivity in early disease, we have performed a quantitative analysis of correlation patterns derived from FDG positron emission tomography (PET) images from ADNI subjects with different levels of cortical b-amyloid. Methods:[18F] florbetapir PET,[18F] FDG PET, and 3D T1-weighted MR images were obtained from ADNI-GO/-2 study subjects classified as cognitively normal or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). PET volumes were registered to a customized MRI template in MNI stereotaxic space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were generated and projected onto each subject\u2019s cortical surface using Biospective\u2019s fully-automated PIANO TM image processing software. The amyloid burden for each subject was determined from a composite region-of-interest (ROI) on [18F] florbetapir images, and subjects were categorized into Amyloid-Low (Ab L) and Amyloid-High (Ab H) groups. We generated vertexwise correlation strength maps across the entire cerebral cortex, controlling for ApoE4 genotype, and assessed the relative alterations in short-/long-range and intra-/interhemispheric metabolic connections in each group. Results: We observed statistically significant differences in short-/long-range and intra \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46299451/j.jalz.2013.05.00420160606-31182-jphwio.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
