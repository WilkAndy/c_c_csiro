On each visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, a MRI and PiB PET scan. A SUVR threshold of 1.5 was used to categorize high (+) and low (-) A\u03b2 burden. Rates of change for A\u03b2 deposition, MRI volumetrics and cognitive decline were derived from the slope of the regression plots over 3\u20135 years and used in the analysis.ResultsA\u03b2 deposition follows sigmoidal kinetics where it takes 27 years to go from the mean SUVR of 1.20 observed in HC-, to reach the 1.5 SUVR threshold. It then takes another 20 years to go from there to the mean SUVR of 2.35 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:sCWLdL-sCz8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2013.08.148", "cites_per_year": {}}
