We used data from the AIBL cohort to provide a better understanding of the relationship between A \u03b2 deposition and cognition in the development of AD.MethodsOne hundred and seventy participants-118 elderly healthy controls (HC); 35 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects; and 17 mild AD patients-were evaluated at enrolment, and 18, 36 and 54 months later. On each visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, a MRI and a 11 C-PiB PET scan. Rates of change for A \u03b2 deposition and cognitive decline were derived from the slope of the regression plots over 3\u20135 years and used in the regression analysis.ResultsA\u03b2 deposition (0.05\u00b10.04 vs 0.01\u00b10.02 SUVR/yr, P< 0.0001) and memory decline (-0.20\u00b10.27 vs-0.02\u00b10.25 SD/yr, P= 0.0005) were significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.293", "cites_per_year": {}}
