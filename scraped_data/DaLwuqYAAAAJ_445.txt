Acquiring CSF is invasive and there is limited access to PET imaging, which makes them prohibitive as general screening tools. Here, we report an updated and refined blood-based panel of analytes from the one described previously. The modified panel is able to predict NAB with high accuracy across two independent studies.MethodsTwo cohorts were utilized; the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study (273 subjects) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)(74 subjects). All plasma samples were assayed on the RBM xMAP panel and by the Innogenetics A\u03b2 assay. To ensure consistency in the calculation for NAB \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.764", "cites_per_year": {}}
