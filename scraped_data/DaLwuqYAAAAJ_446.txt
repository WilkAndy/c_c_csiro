Although prevalence and incidence of LMB has been studied in large populations, there is no literature to date on annual occurrence rates relative to A\u03b2-imaging, as with 11C-PiB PET (PiB). We assessed the baseline prevalence and annualized incidence of LMB according to PiB findings in cohort ranging from cognitively-normal elderly (NC) to Alzheimer's Disease dementia (AD), over 3 years.Methods174 participants were studied at entry from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) with 3T SWI MRI and 11C-PiB PET. 120 (79 NC, 23 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 18 AD) returned for imaging at 18 months or 3 years. Images were inspected for microbleeds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.1642", "cites_per_year": {}}
