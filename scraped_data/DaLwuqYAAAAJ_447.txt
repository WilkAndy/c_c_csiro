Neocortical A b burden (NAB) represents one marker for early detection; currently NAB is quantitatively assessed by expensive positron emission tomography (PET) requiring radiotracers (eg PiB) that are not widely available. CSF and blood markers have reported correlation with NAB and represent alternatives to PET, but alternative cognitive based estimators of NAB are here explored as the basis for accessible and cost effective screening tests.MethodsData from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, with baseline imaging and cognitive measurements were utilised. NAB was measured by PiB-PET standardised-uptake-value-ratio; SUVR with a value greater than 1.5 considered high NAB.
