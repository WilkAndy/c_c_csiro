More recently, cerebrovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including hypertension, heart disease, smoking, hypercholesterolemia and lack of physical activity (PA) have been identified as modifiable risk factors contributing to cognitive decline, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with CVD risk factors, memory complaints and cognitive impairment. The AIBL Active study is designed to investigate whether a 24-month physical activity program can slow down the progression of WMH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: This 24-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) is offered to156 participants, aged 60 and older, in the Melbourne arm of The Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging. Participants must have SMC with or without MCI and at least one cerebrovascular risk factor. The PA intervention is a modification of the intervention previously trialed in older adults with SMC and MCI (Fitness for the Ageing Brain Study-FABS). It comprises 24 months of moderate, home-based PA (150 minutes per week) and a behavioral intervention package. The primary outcome measure will be change in WMH after 24 months on MRI. Cognition, quality of life, functional fitness, level of physical activity, biomarkers and PET Florbetapir comprise secondary measures. Results: The PA intervention successfully used in FABS was extended from a 6-month program to a 24-month program.
