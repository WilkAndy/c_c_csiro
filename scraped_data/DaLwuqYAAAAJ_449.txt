These studies have investigated voxel-averaged quantitative measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with no fibre-bundle specificity in voxels containing multiple distinct fibre bundles. However, recent evidence suggests 90% of WM voxels contain two or more fibre orientations. Here we investigate AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a new, more advanced DWI measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD)[1], which is a measure that can be interpreted as being proportional to the intra-axonal volume of axons oriented along a particular direction [1]. AFD permits population differences to be localised to specific fibre bundles within voxels containing multiple bundles.MethodsDWIs were acquired from 39 AD, 34 MCI and 91 healthy volunteers (age \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.142", "cites_per_year": {}}
