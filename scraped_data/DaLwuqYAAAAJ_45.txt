The diffeomorphic demons method is used for non-rigid registration and a comparison of alternate metrics for atlas selection is presented. A comparison of results from an average shape atlas and the multi-atlas approach is provided. Using the same clinical dataset and manual contours from 50 clinical scans as Klein et al. (2008) a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86 was achieved with an average surface error of 2.00mm using the multi-atlas segmentation method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6167572855862088123", "cites_id": ["6167572855862088123"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-23944-1_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u1EA0NWel1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 12, "2014": 12, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 12, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
