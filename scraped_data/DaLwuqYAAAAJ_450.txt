Previous research has shown that high cardio-respiratory fitness and participation in aerobic exercise training may attenuate age-related volumetric decline of the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe and grey matter. However, this area of research is yet to be thoroughly investigated and understood. The aim of the current study was to assess the relationship between levels of physical activity and numerous volumetric brain measures calculated from MRIs.MethodsThe current study has investigated the association between habitual physical activity participation and volumetric brain measures in 147 healthy men and women aged sixty years and older. Using region of interest analyses on MRIs; volumes of grey matter, white matter, hippocampi, medial temporal lobes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.1341", "cites_per_year": {}}
