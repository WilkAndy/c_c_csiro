Using pair-wise measures between various features of each subject, manifold learning maps these features to a lower dimensional space, where they can be used for further analysis or classification. In this work, we build a joint PiB/MRI manifold to investigate longitudinal changes in Alzheimer's disease.MethodsLongitudinal PiB and T1W MRI images from the AIBL study were used (16 AD, 26 MCI and 138 NC). MR images were segmented, skull-striped and normalised to a canonical brain using a soft non-rigid registration. The segmentations and PiB images were then propagated to the canonical space. A cerebellum mask defined on the population atlas and masked by the GM segmentation was used to SUVR normalise each PiB images. To remove contrast variations due to differing MR scanners a composite \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2012.05.947", "cites_per_year": {}}
