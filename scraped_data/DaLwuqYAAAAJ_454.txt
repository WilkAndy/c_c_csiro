However, once a patient has gone through radio-chemo therapy, CE MRI provides limited accuracy in differentiating tumour recurrence from chemo-radiotherapy induced injury because both tissue types often yield significant contrast enhancement in CE MRI. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using tracers such as 4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) has been shown to be clinically useful for detecting low grade and high grade brain tumours [1] with the limitations of low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, FDOPA PET does not suffer from the specificity limitation of showing radiation injured tissue as tumour tissue. This work tests the hypothesis that specificity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP12567&sb=RECENT&n=5&rpp=10&page=266&tr=4311&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ye6b8G-Xem4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
