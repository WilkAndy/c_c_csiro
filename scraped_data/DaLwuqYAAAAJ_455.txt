PiB SUVR cut-off was 1.5, while cut-offs for HV and memory score were established using ROC analyses with AD and HC. Cox proportional hazards was used to calculate risk ratios adjusted for age, gender and years of education.At baseline, 74% of AD and 61% of MCI had significantly lower HV than HC, while 98% of AD, 65% of MCI and 31% of HC had high PiB (PiB+). At 3 years, 46 MCI (50%) met criteria for dementia, (41 AD, 5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/53/supplement_1/299.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
