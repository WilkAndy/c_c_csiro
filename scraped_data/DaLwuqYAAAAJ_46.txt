To help establish the pathologic correlate of minimum ADC, we undertook a study investigating the relationship between minimum ADC and maximum FDOPA PET uptake in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.MR imaging and FDOPA PET data were acquired preoperatively from 15 patients who were subsequently diagnosed with high-grade brain tumor (WHO grade III or IV) by histopathologic analysis. ADC and SUVR normalized FDOPA PET maps were registered to the corresponding CE MR imaging. Regions of minimum ADC within the FDOPA-defined tumor volume were anatomically correlated with areas of maximum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=685102417988073019", "cites_id": ["685102417988073019"], "pub_url": "http://www.ajnr.org/content/34/4/758.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O7bw8gT5gQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 15, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 3, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
