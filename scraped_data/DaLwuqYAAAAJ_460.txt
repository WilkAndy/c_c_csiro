The aim of this study is to increase the discrimination power of hippocampal shape analysis between AD and normal controls (NC) by focusing on the subregions with atrophy associated with AD and describing the localized shape changes using statistical shape models (SSMs).MethodsThe hippocampal segmentations used in this abstract are provided by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which are divided into a training and a testing set. The training set consists of 60 AD subjects with average age of 75.2 (6.7) and 60 NC subjects of 77.0 (4.8). The testing set consists of 39 AD subjects of 77.8 (7.3) and 78 NC of 76.3 (5.2). The hippocampal SSM is built on the training set. Hotelling's T2 test is performed on each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:UlRcoTO8nVoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.996", "cites_per_year": {}}
