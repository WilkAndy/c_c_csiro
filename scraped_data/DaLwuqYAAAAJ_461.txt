On each visit, participants underwent a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological examination, 3D MRI, and 11C-PiB PET imaging.ResultsAt baseline, AD and MCI had significantly lower hippocampal volumes than HC, while 98% of AD, 63% of MCI and 34% of HC had high PiB (PiB+). By the latest follow-up of the MCI subjects, 42 met criteria for dementia,(38 AD, 2 dementia with Lewy bodies, 1 frontotemporal dementia, 1 vascular dementia) and 3 were re \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:t6hKUfryX1MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.2016", "cites_per_year": {}}
