The aim of the study was to study the development of AD in an elderly population by periodical assessment of a spectrum of biochemical and neuroimaging biomarkers.Methods366 participants: 195 elderly healthy controls (HC)(age 72.2\u00b17.2 years); 92 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects; and 79 mild AD patients, were evaluated at enrolment and 20 and 36 months later, with 5% of participants already reaching the 54-month follow-up mark. On each visit, participants underwent a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological examination, 3D MRI, and 11C-PiB PET imaging.ResultsAt baseline, AD and MCI had significantly lower hippocampal volumes than HC, while 98% of AD, 63% of MCI and 34% of HC had high PiB (PiB+).
