A primary obstacle to this is the lack of electron density (ED) information provided by an MRI scan, Methods exist to correlate ED information with MRI scans; however all induce some error. The ED accuracy required for acceptable dose calculation accuracy has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to quantify the changes in dose calculation accuracy due to ED changes resulting from different electron density assignment methods. A CT of an anthropomorphic phantom represented gold standard ED data. Dose was generated on this data set for a standard cervix plan. The CT data was then manipulated to simulate methods of assigning ED to MRI, including bulk density corrections (with and without bones contoured), and rigid registration CT to MR (simulated by purposefully misaligning the ED data). The standard plan was recalculated on this data. The dose to isocentre and patient volume was compared to determine the impact of ED errors for these methodologies. Differences in dose at isocentre were all less than 2%. DVH comparison showed minimal deviations. The greatest errors were caused by incorrect CT number to E.D. conversion and large misalignments of ED data with the MRl. Results suggest that the choice of electron density assignment to MR may not be significant for cervix treatment. Further work is needed to validate this result, and is ongoing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:5OQWvpknaCIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22067039", "cites_per_year": {}}
