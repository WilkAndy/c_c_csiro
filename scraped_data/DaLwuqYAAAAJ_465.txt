Previously, androgen modulating therapy for AD has been proposed by our group based on published animal and clinical studies. We present a case report on a symptomatic FAD mutation carrier (PS-1) prior to and following testosterone intervention therapy.MethodsWe investigated clinical and blood biomarker correlates in this female aged 32 years. She underwent comprehensive neuropsychological and blood biomarker testing. We monitored blood plasma levels of amyloid beta 1-42, amyloid beta 1-40, clusterin, total apoE and TNF-alpha during the course of this treatment.ResultsNeuropsychological testing revealed a Mini-Mental State \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.1735", "cites_per_year": {}}
