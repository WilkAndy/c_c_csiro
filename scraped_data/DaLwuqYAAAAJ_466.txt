We aimed to test whether subjects with b-amyloid deposition had an increased incidence of cerebral microbleeds and if these were associated with increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH).MethodsThe 152 subjects (32 AD, 36 MCI and 84 healthy controls [HC]) from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study for whom 3T fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) MRI and 11C-PiB PET scans were available were included in this study. MCI and HC subjects were further split into those with high (HC+/MCI+) and low (HC-/MCI-) PiB retention. Global WMH volumes (WMHV) were computed from manual segmentation of FLAIR scans, corrected for age and normalized to intra-cranial volume. Subjects were classified as probable CAA if they had multiple \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.876", "cites_per_year": {}}
