However, only few longitudinal PiB-PET studies have tested this hypothesis with conflicting results 5-7. The purpose of this work is to further our understanding of the dynamic of A\u00df deposition thanks to the use of a large longitudinal neuroimaging cohort.Methods32 AD patients, 49 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 103 healthy controls (HC) from the AIBL study 8 underwent two PiB-PET scans 18 months apart. For each participant, a parametric map of PiB-PET rate of change was created ((Follow-up scan-Baseline scan)/Follow-up Duration) and entered in a voxelwise 3-way ANCOVA, with clinical status (HC, MCI or AD), clinical outcome (conversion from HC to MCI or AD, or from MCI to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2011.05.013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_TMHUL6ZnswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
