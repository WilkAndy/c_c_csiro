However currently bone must be manually segmented making this impractical. This work develops and tests an atlas\u2010based method to automatically segment bone on pelvic MR images for dose calculations. Methods: An MR whole\u2010pelvic atlas was created using manually delineated scans from 39 patients. Atlas\u2010based pelvic\u2010bone auto\u2010segmentations were then created for 25 patient scans using deformable image registration of the atlas to each patients scan with a leave\u2010one\u2010out atlas approach. These and corresponding expert manual segmentations were compared using the Dice similarity coefficient. Bone was assigned a density of 1.19 g/cm3 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.3611541", "cites_per_year": {}}
