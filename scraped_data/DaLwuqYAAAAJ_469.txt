On each visit, participants underwent a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological examination, 3D MRI, and 11C-PiB PET imaging.At baseline, AD and MCI had significantly lower hippocampal volumes than HC, while 98% of AD, 63% of MCI and 34% of HC had high PiB (PiB+). By the latest follow-up of the MCI subjects, 42 met criteria for dementia, (38 AD, 2 dementia with Lewy bodies, 1 frontotemporal dementia, 1 vascular dementia) and 3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/52/supplement_1/121.short", "cites_per_year": {}}
