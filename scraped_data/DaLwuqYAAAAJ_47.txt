Experimental evidence from mouse models demonstrates that the induction of T2D/insulin resistance (IR) can promote the accumulation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathological features. However, the association of T2D with pathological and clinical phenotypes in humans is unclear. Here we investigate the relationship of indices of IR (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic \u03b2-cell function (HOMA-B) with cognitive performance across several domains (Verbal/Visual Episodic Memory, Executive Function, Language and a measure of Global cognition) and AD biomarkers (CSF A\u03b242, T-tau/P-tau, hippocampal volume and neocortical A\u03b2-amyloid burden). We reveal that HOMA-IR (p\u2009<\u20090.001) incrementally increases across diagnostic groups, becoming significantly elevated in the AD group compared with cognitively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:T5V60G5X4B8C", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10789501057233537316", "cites_id": ["10789501057233537316"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09577-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JEkb3AsCvJUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
