In this study two groups of subjects with AD; with and without concomitant CAA were compared to normal controls (NC) using the tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) method. On average the groups with concomitant CAA had 15% more voxels that were significantly different from NC where those without CAA. These results suggest that WMH can have a considerable impact on analysis of FA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:yifHVNw3tWEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2011/2223.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
