In this work we demonstrate the use of a recently developed measure called Apparent Fibre Density (AFD) to detect differences in MND within pathways related to the motor cortex. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using AFD analysis in the context of multiple fibre orientations, by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:1lB6hEDIqXYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2011/2315.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
