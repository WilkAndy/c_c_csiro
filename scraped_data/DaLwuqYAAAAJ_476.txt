We propose to assess streamline length in a fully automated voxel-wise manner. The length distribution within an individual voxel can be described by a mixture of Gaussian distributions, and compared across subjects. Voxel-wise length distributions appear to be highly reproducible over time. We demonstrate how this new method can be used to identify fibre populations affected by white matter pathology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/80557", "cites_per_year": {}}
