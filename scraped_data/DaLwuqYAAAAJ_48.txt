AIBL aims to improve understanding of the pathogenesis, early clinical manifestation, and diagnosis of AD, and identify diet and lifestyle factors that influence the development of AD. For AIBL, the magnetic resonance imaging parameters of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were adopted and the Pittsuburgh compound B (11C\u2010PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition and neuropsychological tests were designed to permit comparison and pooling with ADNI data. Differences to ADNI include assessment every 18\u2010months, imaging in 25% (magnetic resonance imaging, 11C\u2010PiB PET but no fluorodeoxyglucose PET \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5817731262713606350", "cites_id": ["5817731262713606350"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2010.03.009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zrC6gMK7vFAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
