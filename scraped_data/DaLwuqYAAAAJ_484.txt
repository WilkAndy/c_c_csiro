Selection of HC favored subjective memory complainers (54% of total) and ApoE-\u220a 4 allele carriers (43%). On each visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination and imaging with 3D MRI and amyloid imaging with 11C-PiB PET using ADNI compatible methods. PiB binding was calculated using the cerebellar cortex as reference region (SUVR) with a cut-off value of 1.5 for PiB+ derived from hierarchical cluster analysis of the HC scans.ResultsAt baseline, AD and aMCI had lower \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2010.05.430", "cites_per_year": {}}
