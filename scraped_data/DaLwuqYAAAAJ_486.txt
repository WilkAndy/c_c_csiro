Longitudinal in-vivo A\u03b2 imaging with 11C-PiB PET can address this question and further define the role of A\u03b2 deposition in AD.Clinical follow-up was obtained 20\u00b13 months after PiB-PET in 188 subjects, 34 with AD, 57 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 97 age-matched healthy controls (HC). A repeat scan was obtained at follow-up in 160 subjects and a third scan after 3-years in 35. PiB binding was assessed using region to cerebellar cortex ratios (SUVR).At baseline, 97% of AD, 67% of MCI and 30% of HC showed high PiB binding. At 20-month follow-up, increases in PiB SUVR were observed in AD (5.7%) and the HC with high baseline PiB (1.5%). There was a weak correlation between change in PiB and decline in cognition.
