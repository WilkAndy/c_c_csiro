High resolution structural (T1-weighted MPRAGE, 1x1x1. 2 mm) and HARDI diffusion data were acquired for each of the subjects. The HARDI scans were acquired with an EPI sequence (60 diffusion encoding directions, b-value= 3000 s mm-1, 2.3 mm isotropic) on a Siemens Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangan, Germany). The T1-weighted scans were co-registered to the b0 image of the diffusion scan using an affine registration [4] and skull-stripped using the brain extraction tool [5]. Following this, probabilistic tractography was performed with the MRtrix software (http://www. brain. org. au/software) by seeding once at each voxel of the co-registered skull stripped mask.. Visitation maps were generated from the tractograms by counting the number of tracks that pass through each voxel. To test the stability of the visitation maps, the above procedure was repeated a hundred times and two average maps were generated by averaging N randomly picked visitation maps. The error between the two average images was computed using) 2/)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/44868570/A_Monte-Carlo_approach_for_estimating_wh20160418-13690-1iucj36.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
