However, the computational cost of non-local means is prohibitive, especially for large 3D images. Modifications have previously been proposed to reduce the cost, which result in image artefacts. This paper proposes a compact rotation invariant descriptor. Testing demonstrates improved denoising performance relative to optimized non-local means. Rotation invariant non-local means is an order of magnitude faster."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/7623/76233C/Compact-rotation-invariant-descriptor-for-non-local-means/10.1117/12.844088.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7eJoMHW7_gQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
