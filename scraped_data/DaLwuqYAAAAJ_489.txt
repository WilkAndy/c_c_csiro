AIBL aims to improve understanding of the pathogenesis, early clinical manifestation, and diagnosis of AD and identify diet and lifestyle factors that influence the development of AD. For AIBL, the MRI parameters of ADNI were adopted and the 11C-PiB PET acquisition and neuropsychological tests were designed to permit comparison and pooling with ADNI data. Differences to ADNI include assessment every 18-months, imaging in only 25%(MRI, 11C-PiB PET but no FDG PET), more comprehensive neuropsychological testing and detailed collection of diet and lifestyle data. AIBL has completed the first 18-month follow-up and is making imaging and clinical data available via the ADNI website.
