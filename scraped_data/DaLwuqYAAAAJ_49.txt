In an earlier phase IIa, 3 month trial, PBT2 lowered cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2 by 13% and improved cognition (executive function) in a dose-related fashion in early AD. We, therefore, sought to learn whether PBT2 could alter the A\u03b2-PET signal in subjects with prodromal or mild AD, in an exploratory randomized study over a 12-month phase in a double-blind and a 12-month open label extension phase trial design.For inclusion, the usual clinical criteria for prodromal or probable AD, Mini\u2013Mental State Examination \u226520, and global Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) >1.7 were used.
