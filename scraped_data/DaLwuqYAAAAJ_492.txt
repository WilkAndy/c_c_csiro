Development of tracers such as 11C-PiB and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences such as fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) has made possible the in-vivo evaluation of these pathologies. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between regional 11C-PiB retention and total WMH volume. Our cohort consisted of subjects with probable Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)(N= 25), mild cognitive impairment (MCI)(N= 27) and normal controls (NC)(N= 84). The MCI and NC groups were further divided into NC-pos and MCI-pos (neocortex PiB> 1.5) and NC-neg and MCI-neg (neocortex PiB< 1.5). Methods: Manual segmentation of the WMHs from the FLAIR scans was conducted and total WMH volume computed. The total WMH volume was binned into a histogram for each of the groups. Corresponding segmentations of gray and white matter (GM and WM) from T1-weighted MRI were used to perform partial volume correction (PVC). PiB retention was assessed within 9 regions of interest (only GM voxels were included) after PVC and standardized uptake ratio value normalization. Correlation between regional 11C-PiB retention and total lesion volume and total number of lesions was conducted. Results: The histogram of total lesions volumes is presented in Figure 1 below. Significant differences in lesion volume were only observed between the AD and NC-neg groups (p< 0.02). The MCI-neg group had the highest percentage of subjects with large (> 25 mL) lesion volume \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50341440/j.jalz.2009.04.13020161115-5154-1q6lxrk.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
