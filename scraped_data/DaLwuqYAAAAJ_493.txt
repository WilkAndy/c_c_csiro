Some features/patterns can be missed by statistical methods due to the difficulty of obtaining adequate normative databases given the large variance in some areas of the brain in normals. The usefulness of a combined visual-semiquantitative and quantitative Brain SPECT protocol was evaluated. Methods: Two Institutions using same triple head gamma camera, and 99mTc-HMPAO. Each place has its own visual evaluation: one is based on the camera\u2019s own software package. The other is based on a discrete color code supplemented by 4 levels of thresholded volumes and, 8 color Talairach normalized surface views (Neurostat). The quantitative protocol was based on an automated analysis software (BRASS) applied to asses relative blood flow (cerebellar ratios). Population: 30 cases referred for memory problems and/or possible dementia differential, and for whom, clinical, followup of> 1 year and/or other information was available; ages: 48-81 (55% males). Results: The semiquantitative evaluation included: 1) hemispheric cortex (including orbitofrontal and lateral temporal areas; 2) limbic and paralimbic structures; 3) subcortical structures; 4) cerebellum & pons. The quantitative algorithm provided the slice display and tabulated results of 47 regions. In 22/30 cases abnormalities suggested a mixed etiology and in some, suggestions of patterns of superimposed comorbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis etc.). In 4/30 a single etiology was suggested and in 2/30 no definite cortical nor posterior cingulate abnormalities but only subcortical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50192171/j.jalz.2009.05.05520161108-20935-wgoh7d.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
