The extracted points were matched to the predefined corresponding points of the spine in a rat atlas. Their correspondences field was used to perform skeletons registration by thin-plate-spline (TPS).  Further, we extend 3D shape context algorithm for landmarks matching for rat limbs between the atlas and the newly extracted skeletons. The correspondences found were used to perform the rat limb skeletons registration by TPS.Experiments were described using phantoms and actual rat skeletons.
