The effect of including or excluding bone from the bulk density plan was also examined, and effective depth calculations were used to calculate the optimal average density for bone in these plans."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:nYc7v9NCwtsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/ba773bf9855ee476d55e5621f27a4275/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=33672", "cites_per_year": {}}
