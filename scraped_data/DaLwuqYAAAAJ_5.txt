The present study aims to assess this relationship.Brain magnetic resonance imaging and [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)\u2010positron emission tomography scans were obtained from 94 healthy elderly subjects (49 with subjective cognitive impairment), 34 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 35 patients with Alzheimer disease. The correlations between global and regional neocortical PiB retention and atrophy were analyzed in each clinical group.Global and regional atrophy were strongly related to \u03b2\u2010amyloid load in participants with subjective cognitive impairment but not in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer disease.
