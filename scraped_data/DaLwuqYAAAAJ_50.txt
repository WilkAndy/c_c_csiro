In addition, subjective memory complaints (SMC) might be a first clinical expression of the effect of AD pathology on cognitive functioning. Objective: To assess whether APOE 4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory are risk factors for high amyloid-(A) burden in cognitively normal elderly.Methods: 307 cognitively normal participants (72.7\u00b16.8 years, 53% female, 55% SMC) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent amyloid PET and APOE genotyping. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of APOE 4 genotype, age, SMC, and episodic memory with A pathology. Results: Odds of high A burden were greater at an older age (OR= 3.21; 95% CI= 1.68\u20136.14), when SMC were present (OR= 1.90; 95% CI= 1.03\u20133.48), and for APOE 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:P6jpBLdrFncC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2361100706235532683", "cites_id": ["2361100706235532683"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad150446", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i8UXKpVQxCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 16, "2018": 11, "2019": 14, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
