A quarter of the participants will undergo both PiB-PET and MRI. Recruitment started in January 2007.MethodsParticipants comprise 5 equal-sized groups: 1) Healthy participants (HP) with no genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease (AD); 2) HP with an ApoE4 allele; 3) HP with subjective memory complaint; 4) Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); and 5) early stage AD. All participants undergo a comprehensive neuropsychological examination, and blood is collected for biomarker analysis. MRI comprises 3D T1 MP-RAGE and T2 FSE. PiB PET images are acquired from 40\u201370 mins post-injection of 10 mCi of 11C-PiB and analyzed visually and with regional and global cortical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2008.05.827", "cites_per_year": {}}
