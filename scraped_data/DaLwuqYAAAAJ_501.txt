Neuropathological studies have shown that the initial plaques are located in the temporal and orbitofrontal cortices, extending later to the cingulate, frontal and parietal cortices. We examined the spectrum of variation of PiB PET images from normal healthy elderly controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) participants of the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study.MethodsTo characterize the variability of Beta-amyloid deposition in a sample of 25 AD, 18 MCI and 54 NC, we used principal component analysis (PCA) on the voxel data. All images were SUVR normalized and non-linearly registered to an atlas. PCA decomposes the voxel data into modes of variation, which characterize the uptake pattern found \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2008.05.748", "cites_per_year": {}}
