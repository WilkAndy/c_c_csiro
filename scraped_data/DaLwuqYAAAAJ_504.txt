Quantitative regional analysis that utilizes data such as mean uptake values of specific brain areas can be hampered by PVE. We investigated the effect of PVE correction and region of interest (ROI) size on the analysis of 11 C-PiB PET images, and determined the optimal strategy for 11 C-PiB quantification.MethodsThirty-eight participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were imaged with 11 C-PiB PET and 3D T1 MRI. Eight had Alzheimer's Disease (AD), ten had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and twenty were normal elderly controls (NC). MRI scans were classified into gray matter (GM), white matter, cerebrospinal fluid. PET intensity was normalized using the standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) method using the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2008.05.2582", "cites_per_year": {}}
