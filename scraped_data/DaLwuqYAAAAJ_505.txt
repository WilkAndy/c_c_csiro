We propose a novel voxel based method which is both accurate and computationally efficient. The novelty of the approach is to integrate the partial volume information when computing the thickness using the Laplacian definition of thickness.MethodsMR images were classified into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) in their native space by using an expectation maximisation (EM) approach. Fractional content of GM for the voxels along tissue interfaces was computed by modeling mixture of tissues and performing a maximum a posteriori classification. The cortical thickness was computed using the Laplacian approach which divides the cortex into a set of equipotential sublayers. Normalised gradient of the Laplace solution provides \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2008.05.072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Lf0J2zWZk9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
