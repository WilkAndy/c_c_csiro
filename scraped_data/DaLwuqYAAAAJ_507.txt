Combined with an anisotropic diffusion scheme tailored to preserve the boundaries at a given level, an efficient way for enhancing large structures in 3D images is presented. In our approach, the partial differential equation defining the evolution of the intensity in the image is solved in an explicit scheme at multiple resolutions in an ascending-descending cycle. Intensity 'flux' between distant voxels is allowed, while preserving borders relative to the scale. Experiments have been performed both with phantoms and with real data from 3D Transrectal Ultrasound Imaging. The effectiveness of the method to remove speckle noise and to enhance large structures such as the prostate has been demonstrated.
