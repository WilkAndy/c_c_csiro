Special attention has been paid to the generation of ultrasound images from CT or MRI data, haptic rendering, and soft tissue deformation for visual and tactile feedback. Literature has been researched about different approaches to the synthesis of ultrasound images, ranging from physics-based simulation of ultrasound wave propagatio...\u00bb"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:pIp0rujYkN4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1630612", "cites_per_year": {}}
