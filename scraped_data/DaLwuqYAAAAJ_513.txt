This method involves registration between neighbouring slices using a modified control grid interpolation algorithm that selectively accepts displacement field updates (to optimize performance). A cubic interpolator is then applied to pixel intensities correlated by the displacement fields.We applied this interpolation method to correct the motion affected MRI volumes by: 1. Creating a new volume where every axial slice from the artefact affected shot is removed and replaced with an interpolated slice and then; 2. For each of these slices, we used 2D non-rigid registration to register each original axial slice back to it\u2019s matching interpolated slice. As this registration is mono-modal, we used the 2D Demons algorithm [4, 5] for non-rigid registration."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.na-mic.org/w/img_auth.php/5/54/Miccaiws-dowling.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4pjr3lMFSx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
