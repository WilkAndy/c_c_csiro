We used B-splines to model level-set functions using fewer knots/coefficients than pixels. This forces the contours to be smooth without the need to minimize smoothing terms. We implemented a standard variational method where objects were segmented based on their edges. We also developed a method to segment images of piecewise constant intensity objects. In this case the level-sets were directly computed from a classification step without evolving the contours. We tested our method on simulated MRI brain data. We showed that by using three level-sets in a multi-layer scheme, the classification of brain tissues was more robust than the standard fuzzy c-means algorithm even with spatial regularization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4193514/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FjdwIwUB9VQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
