A neocortical standardized uptake value ratio threshold \u2265 1.45 was used to discriminate high from low A\u03b2 burden. Correlations were adjusted for age, gender and years of education.High A\u03b2 burden was found in 53% of MCI. Regression analyses showed standardized uptake value ratio (r = -0.51, P = 0.0015) and hippocampal volume (r = 0.60, P = 0.024) both contributing to episodic memory impairment in independent fashion. White matter hyperintensities correlated with nonmemory cognition, and this correlation was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17702905008063076770", "cites_id": ["17702905008063076770"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/alzrt158", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:olkVkk9arfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
