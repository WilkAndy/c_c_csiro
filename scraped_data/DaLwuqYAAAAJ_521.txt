We use intravascular and surface array coils giving good signal sensitivity \nbut significant inhomogeneity. Because multiple images are obtained, it is desirable to acquire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.actapress.com/PDFViewer.aspx?paperId=16956", "cites_per_year": {}}
