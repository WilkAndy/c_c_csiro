AFD enables voxel-based analysis to be performed over space and orientation, and therefore population differences may be attributed to a single fibre within a voxel containing multiple fibres. Performing comparisons over many orientations within each voxel increases the number of multiple comparisons. We present a method for cluster-based inference of spatially extended differences in AFD by identifying clusters of contiguous supra-threshold directions using neighbours defined in space and orientation. The proposed method is demonstrated using a cohort of Motor Neurone Disease and healthy subjects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RELVpAr6_7wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2011/1912.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
