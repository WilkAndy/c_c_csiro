These findings suggest that A\u03b2 may be one of the mechanisms underlying the relation between the two conditions. We sought to determine the relation between elevated cerebral A\u03b2 and the presence of depression across a 54\u2010month prospective observation period.Cognitively normal older adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study who were not depressed and had undergone a positron emission tomography scan to classify them as either high A\u03b2 (n\u2009=\u200981) or low A\u03b2 (n\u2009=\u2009278) participated. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale \u2014 Short Form at 18\u2010month intervals over 54 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:UwBXQvKX0hQC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10250651772718684577", "cites_id": ["10250651772718684577"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gps.4489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oRkgHXqhQY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 8}}
