Accurate delineation of such lesions is crucial in analyzing the structure-function relationships of the brain post-stroke and critical in the management of stroke patients. The method firstly employed a maximum aposteriori-Markov field based segmentation of the probable lesion areas from hyperintense regions of FLAIR images. Then features of these lesion areas from the multimodal MRI were used to train/test a random forest classifier. The performance was evaluated on 36 stroke patients (mean Dice 0.60+/-0.12, volume correlation 0.76)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:abCsMXLaarkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2014/4794.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
