The FLAWS sequence was derived from the MP2RAGE sequence to provide multiple T1-weigthed contrasts that were shown to be of interest for a wide range of clinical applications. The current study shows that the FLAWS sequence can be used to generate 7T T1-weigthed images and T1 maps with reduced B1+ sensitivity, while overcoming the resolution and CNR limitations imposed to the MP2RAGE sequence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:gdpqVl03G0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2020/3707.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GoPC06rvy3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
