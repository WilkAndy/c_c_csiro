Here, we present optimised methods for imaging and processing MND patient data using UHF MRI with submillimetre resolution, and compare hippocampal subfields between patients and healthy controls. We used automatic measures to examine the shape, volume, and morphology of hippocampal subfields and showed specific changes in MND patients that are more sensitive than previous research. This work may serve as a framework for more sensitive computational models for biological characterisation of MND in vivo."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:C7HQDqNFSbYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2020/1568.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SOh03qj5I74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
