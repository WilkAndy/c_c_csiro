Anatomical image quality can be improved by acquiring consecutive anatomical scans and combining them to boost SNR and sharpness. We aimed to find the optimal combination method of three repetitions of high-resolution turbo spin-echo (TSE) scans, commonly used for hippocampus subfield segmentation. We used non-linear realignment between the TSE repetitions in a range of participants at 3T and 7T and found that image segmentation reliability and sharpness were higher for the non-linear realignment technique, as compared to linearly realigned, and averaged methods. Hippocampus image segmentation greatly benefits from this technique."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:OxQqgzTNpSoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2020/2001.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zc_TS8A4xTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
