In particular, the FLAWS sequence allows for the generation of a standard anatomical contrast, a contrast with WM signal suppression and a GM-specific contrast. This study introduces a combination of FLAWS images to generate a new contrast that may be suitable for the detection of brain lesions at 7T. While the preliminary results of this study are promising, a further validation is required by imaging subjects with lesions and comparing the new FLAWS contrast with other MR sequences."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0x7hHEPTrR8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2020/3706.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LxmOkbIPkiQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
