It may critically influence structural measurements (volumes, cortical thickness) if not taken into account. This study aims at comparing the plebiscited PV estimation technique and the proposed method on four MP2RAGE datasets. The experimental results match with the simulations and show that the plebiscited method tends to understimate GM in both types of mixtures (GM/CSF and GM/WM). This implies a global GM volume underestimation of 3.43% in average."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RzXy5zvoWjEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2014/1794.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
