PV may be critical when dealing with changes in brain anatomy as the considered structures such as gray matter (GM) are of similar size as the MR spatial resolution. To overcome the limitations imposed by PV effects and achieve subvoxel accuracy different methods have been proposed. Here, we describe a method to compute PV by modeling the MR signal with a biexponential linear combination representing the contribution of at most two tissues in each voxel. In a first step, we estimated the parameters (T1, T2 and proton density) per tissue. Then, based on the bi-exponential formulation one can retrieve fractional contents by solving a linear system of two equations with two unknowns, namely tissue magnetizations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_xmTp9Pj6u8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16553925343638559712&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4JvpwWRbu-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
