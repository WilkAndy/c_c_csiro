For visualising the prostate and determining the target volume for radiation treatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gives vastly superior soft\u2010tissue contrast. However, currently, MRI scans cannot be used for dose planning, as they do not provide the electron density information. We aimed to develop an alternative and efficient MRI\u2010only image\u2010based workflow, enabling both organ delineation and dose planning to be performed using MRI, with \u201cpseudo\u2010CT scans\u201d generated from MRI scans supplying the information for dose planning. The feasibility of implementing MRI\u2010based prostate radiation therapy planning is being investigated through collaboration between the clinical and medical physics group at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3993447294768549518", "cites_id": ["3993447294768549518"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.2011.tb02939.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jo7sCSiTazcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 3, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
