This study assessed cerebrovascular pathology in terms of brain infarction and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the AIBL study, and investigated its impact on amyloid deposition. Our data revealed significantly greater WMH burden and higher prevalence of cerebrovascular pathology in AD patients. No correlation was found between amyloid load and WMH in either healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment or AD. Moreover, the presence of cerebrovascular pathology showed no association with amyloid deposition in subjects with or without AD."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:kFzFP8IdBVAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2018/3746.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-b2iBdNOrdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
