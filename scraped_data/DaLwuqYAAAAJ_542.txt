We derived measurements in the peak direction identified from the FOD, and evaluated the test-retest reliability for these FOD peak amplitudes using the intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient. We visualized the ICC coefficients on the FOD orientation plot. We compared the reliability of measuring the FOD peak amplitudes and the fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:T-Bu49-jKQgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2013/2119.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
