In this study, an image processing framework was employed to normalize the uncalibrated intensity of SWI with respect to the corresponding value of cerebrospinal fluid. After excluding large detectable veins, the resulting pseudo-quantitative image along with a standard brain atlas, were used to compute regional concentrations of iron in a cohort of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. A group-wise analysis was then showed a stepwise increment in SWI-iron along the progression of the disease."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:rEjdzzKT7SMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2016/1258.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xm-M5bh45lIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
