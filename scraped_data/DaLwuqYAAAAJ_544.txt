However, only few studies focus on contrast changes between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). To our knowledge, no longitudinal study of tissue intensities has been reported. We hypothesize that tissue alteration as measured by WM/GM could provide insights into the etiology of Alzheimers disease (AD). We investigate the longitudinal evolution of the contrast using a new tissue normalisation method. The MRI intensity normalisation enable to measure significant change in contrast between AD patient and healthy elder."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:osi8XriVlOYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://archive.ismrm.org/2011/4120.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
