Australia A Multi-step 3D Inhomogeneity Correction Process (M3DIC) \nIntroduction Methods Summary Results A High field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can \ngive us beautiful images of the brain but is plagued by a shadowing artefact known as intensity \ninhomogeneity. The artefact causes identical tissues and structures to appear quite different \ndepending on their location within the image. This issue will increasingly confound researchers \nand clinicians as they move from 1.5 Tesla (T) to higher 3T systems, and beyond, as intensity \ninhomogeneity not only escalates with higher magnet field strength, but also becomes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:3_iODIlCio4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian-Coe/publication/236632084_A_Multi-step_3D_Inhomogeneity_Correction_Process_M3DIC/links/00b7d51891794df3bc000000/A-Multi-step-3D-Inhomogeneity-Correction-Process-M3DIC.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
