Here, we applied fixel-based analysis (FBA) to diffusion MRI data to investigate changes in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. AD patients exhibited significant reductions in both fibre density and cross-section across multiple fibre tracts, while significant decreases in MCI were only evident in the posterior cingulum and uncinate, upon tract-of-interest analysis. This work demonstrates the value of FBA in identifying both macroscopic and microscopic changes to specific fibre pathways in the investigation of AD."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:7jLzoj1EsW0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thijs-Dhollander/publication/315836265_Fibre-specific_white_matter_changes_in_Alzheimer's_disease_novel_insights_from_Fixel-Based_Analysis/links/58fc02774585152eded12ae3/Fibre-specific-white-matter-changes-in-Alzheimers-disease-novel-insights-from-Fixel-Based-Analysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T5lIY9Lf25oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
