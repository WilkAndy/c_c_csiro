The field continues to make significant advances, however, automated analysis and interpretation of data is still very challenging. We have developed a medical imaging analysis and visualization platform, MILXView [1], which incorporates numerous advanced algorithms that provide improved automated image analysis and interpretation of medical imaging data. A greater variety of data sets, and their increased in size are resultants of improvements in imaging applications and techniques, and the analysis of data. The increase in medical image numbers and applications, places additional burden on existing computational hardware to process data and extract clinical information. This paper presents a framework that addresses this issue by utilizing the features of Galaxy to upload and process medical imaging data in a cloud environment by executing MILXView pipelines. Advantages of this approach includes the reduced necessity to continually buy and support expensive hardware, the ability to process data on (theoretically) an infinite number of nodes, thus reducing processing times, and an increase in storage capacity. Data storage is out of scope of this abstract, however, Galaxy and MILXView can be linked with XNAT (a tool to manage the import, and archiving of processed data), to provide an all-encompassing cloud solution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:FcH-RsB9iB0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11340812838619075685&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZVQUxjCpYp0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
