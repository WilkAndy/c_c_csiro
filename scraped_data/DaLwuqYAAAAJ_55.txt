Neuroimaging methods such as diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography, which probe the connectivity of neural networks, show significant promise. We present a machine learning approach to classify TBI participants primarily with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on altered structural connectivity patterns derived through the network based statistical analysis of structural connectomes generated from TBI and age-matched control groups. In this approach, higher order diffusion models were used to map white matter connections between 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Tracts between these regions were generated using probabilistic tracking and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) measures along these connections were encoded in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0_RpHV3rhqYC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17355915630993937336", "cites_id": ["17355915630993937336"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916000719", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uBMLkU-Z3PAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
