It is of great interest to understand what differentiates these subjects from those without Abeta deposition or with both Abeta deposition and cognitive deficits.METHODS:[11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and brain magnetic resonance (MR) scans were obtained in healthy controls (HC) and patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). MR data were compared between PiB-positive and PiB-negative cases, and between PiB-positive cases with or without cognitive deficits.RESULTS: Larger global and regional\u2013temporal\u2013grey matter (GM) volumes were found in PiB-positive compared to PiB-negative HC. The same finding was obtained using different PiB thresholds, using a matched age, education, MMSE, ApoE4 and sexe subsample, using manual delineation of the hippocampus instead of voxel-based analysis, and correcting PiB data for partial averaging. Greater temporal GM volume in the HC was associated with better episodic memory performance. By contrast, significant GM atrophy was found in PiB-positive SCI compared to PiB-negative SCI, as well as in PiB-positive SCI, MCI, and AD compared to PiB-positive HC.CONCLUSIONS: Greater GM volume in PiB-positive cognitively unimpaired elderly may reflect either an inflammatory response to Abeta deposition or a higher brain reserve. Our complementary analyses tend to support the second hypothesis.
