Often techniques are compared through computation of required sample size estimates for future clinical 37 trials. However interpretation of such comparisons is rendered complex because, despite using the same publicly 38 available cohorts, the various techniques have been assessed with different data exclusions and different statis-39 tical analysis models. We created the MIRIAD atrophy challenge in order to test various capabilities of atrophy 40 measurement techniques. The data consisted of 69 subjects (46 Alzheimer's disease, 23 control) who were 41 scanned multiple (up to twelve) times at nine visits over a follow-up period of one to two years, resulting in 42 708 total image sets. Nine participating groups from 6 countries completed the challenge by providing volumetric 43 measurements of key structures (whole brain, lateral ventricle, left and right hippocampi) for each dataset and 44 atrophy measurements of these structures for each time point pair (both forward and backward) of a given sub-45 ject. From these results, we formally compared techniques using exactly the same dataset. First, we assessed the 46 repeatability of each technique using rates obtained from short intervals where no measurable atrophy is expect-47 ed. For those measures that provided direct measures of atrophy between pairs of images, we also assessed sym-48 metry and transitivity. Then, we performed a statistical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:Xt3t5HrhCpYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew-Senjem/publication/281055549_Assessing_atrophy_measurement_techniques_in_dementia_Results_from_the_MIRIAD_Atrophy_Challenge/links/55de038308ae79830bb5830a/Assessing-atrophy-measurement-techniques-in-dementia-Results-from-the-MIRIAD-Atrophy-Challenge.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1hWn1eM7W8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
