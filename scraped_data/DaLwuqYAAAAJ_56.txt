However, no study to-date has examined the relationship between MeDi adherence and accumulation of cerebral A\u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2; a pathological hallmark of AD) in older adults. Cognitively normal healthy control participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Ageing completed the Cancer Council of Victoria Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline, which was used to construct a MeDi score for each participant (score range 0\u20139; higher score indicating higher adherence). Cerebral A\u03b2 load was quantified by Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography at baseline, 18 and 36 months: Only individuals categorised as \u201cA\u03b2 accumulators\u201d, and thus considered to be on the AD pathway, were included in the analysis (N\u2009=\u200977).
