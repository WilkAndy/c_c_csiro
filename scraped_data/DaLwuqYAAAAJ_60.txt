The inclusion of individuals with severe or uncontrolled systemic medical illness or prodromal neurodegenerative disease in normal aging samples is likely to bias estimates toward lower cognitive performance and inflate estimates of variability.Unbiased estimates of cognitive aging in 658 adults aged 60\u201384, who underwent rigorous screening to ensure their general and cognitive health, were computed. The first study screened the psychometric properties of a battery of neuropsychological tests in order to identify those with optimal properties to evaluate cognitive aging. The second study used the selected tests to compare baseline performance within 5-year age bands from 60 to 84 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ToZsFq5dof0C", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11233710368309016289", "cites_id": ["11233710368309016289"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/acn/article-abstract/32/2/142/2655685", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4XaurA8o5psJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
