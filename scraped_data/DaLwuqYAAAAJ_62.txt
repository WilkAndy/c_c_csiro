Cognitively normal older adults (CN) (n = 178) and adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 49) underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging, magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessments at baseline, 18- and 36-months. Relative to A\u03b2\u2212 CNs, A\u03b2+ CNs and A\u03b2+ MCIs showed greater rates of cognitive decline, A\u03b2 accumulation, and hippocampal atrophy. Analysis of interrelationships between these Alzheimer's disease markers in A\u03b2+ CNs and MCIs indicated that rate of A\u03b2 accumulation was associated with rate of hippocampal atrophy (\u03b2 = \u22120.05, p = .037), which was in turn associated independently with rate of decline in memory (\u03b2 = \u22120.03, p = .032). This suggests that A\u03b2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:goOyc-W9OFwC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2335564465926734085", "cites_id": ["2335564465926734085"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/acn/article-abstract/30/1/49/2726842", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BYGW5YGXaSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
