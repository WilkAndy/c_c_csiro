These age-related diseases primarily affect different parts of the central nervous system but are substantially similar in terms of abnormal extracellular deposits, metabolic and oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and microvascular abnormalities. While AMD is a retinal disease, AD is reported to affect not only the brain but also the retina, with A\u03b2 deposits, neurodegeneration and vascular changes. Large population based studies have provided conflicting results regarding the comorbidity of AD and AMD. This study investigated signs of AMD in a small but well characterized cohort from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of aging (AIBL). The cohort consisted of 22 AD patients (age 70.2 \u00b1 9.0 yrs, 13 male, 9 female) and 101 cognitively normal (CN) participants (age 71.3 \u00b1 6.0 yrs, 40 male, 61 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ZJWHNt7Cjk4C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9086373981056579412", "cites_id": ["9086373981056579412"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/car/2016/00000013/00000011/art00007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VLc6ff5IGX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 15, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
