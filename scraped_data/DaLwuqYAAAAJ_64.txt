However, the timing and mode of action of APOE is not understood, nor has there been a detailed analysis of the effect of APOE genotype on memory, hippocampal volume, and amyloid-\u00df (A\u00df) levels in cognitively normal adults. Objective: Examine the effect of APOE allelic genotype on the relationship between A\u00df levels, hippocampal volume, and memory in cognitively normal adults.Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 989 cognitively normal older adults enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, all of whom underwent APOE genotyping and memory assessment. A subset of this group underwent PET neuroimaging for A\u00df (n= 585) and MRI for hippocampal volume (n= 303 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:YAnBoHO8NTMC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2674287005323030666", "cites_id": ["2674287005323030666"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ivC4w9z5HCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 13, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
