Nonlocal means, a recently proposed technique, outperforms other methods in removing noise while retaining image structure, albeit at prohibitive computational cost. Modifications have been proposed to reduce the cost, but the method is still too slow for practical filtering of 3D images. This paper proposes a hashed approach to explicitly represent two summed frequency (hash) functions of local descriptors (patches), utilizing all available image data. Unlike other approaches, the hash spaces are discretized on a regular grid, so primarily linear operations are used. The large memory requirements are overcome by recursing the hash spaces. Additional speed gains are obtained by using a marginal linear interpolation method. Careful choice of the patch features results in high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15852657478138563416", "cites_id": ["15852657478138563416"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5482584/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WItjQvzz_9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
