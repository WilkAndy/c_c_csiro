Manual identification of CMBs is time-consuming, has limited reliability and reproducibility, and is prone to misinterpretation. In this paper, a novel computer-aided microbleed detection technique based on machine learning is presented: First, spherical-like objects (potential CMB candidates) with their corresponding bounding boxes were detected using a novel multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian technique. A set of robust 3-dimensional Radon- and Hessian-based shape descriptors within each bounding box were then extracted to train a cascade of binary random forests (RF). The cascade consists of consecutive independent RF classifiers with low to high posterior probability constraints to handle imbalanced training sets (CMBs and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:6tHXJaRVc1QC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3272569327355293707", "cites_id": ["3272569327355293707"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611115001421", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:C_DZ43aAai0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
