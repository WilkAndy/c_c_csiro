It is also used for recruitment and as an outcome measure in therapeutic trials, requiring accurate and reproducible quantification of A\u03b2 burden in the brain.Data from eighty-eight subjects (52 male subjects, aged 79.8 \u00b1 10.6 years) who underwent antemortem 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging less than a year before neuropathological assessment at autopsy were evaluated. Image analysis was performed using the standard Centiloid (CL) statistical parametric mapping approach and CapAIBL\u00ae. Imaging results were compared against autopsy data.Against combined Bielschowsky silver staining and immunohistochemistry histopathological scores, statistical parametric mapping had 96% sensitivity, 96% specificity, and 95% accuracy, whereas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:kMrClmKSQGwC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10072599250657738829", "cites_id": ["10072599250657738829"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526019300755", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TQBSzKYPyYsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 15, "2022": 19, "2023": 5}}
