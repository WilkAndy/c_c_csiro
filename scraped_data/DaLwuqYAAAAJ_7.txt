Early detection of AD, prior to irreversible neurological damage, is important for the efficacy of current interventions as well as for the development of new treatments. Although PiB-PET imaging and CSF amyloid are the gold standards for early AD diagnosis, there are practical limitations for population screening. AD-related pathology occurs primarily in the brain, but some of the hallmarks of the disease have also been shown to occur in other tissues, including the retina, which is more accessible for imaging. Retinal vascular changes and degeneration have previously been reported in AD using optical coherence tomography and laser Doppler techniques. This report presents results from analysis of retinal photographs from AD and healthy control participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 276, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13032480272919932051", "cites_id": ["13032480272919932051"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/tp2012150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k6ytWcKr3LQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 18, "2015": 19, "2016": 22, "2017": 32, "2018": 23, "2019": 30, "2020": 37, "2021": 35, "2022": 34, "2023": 17}}
