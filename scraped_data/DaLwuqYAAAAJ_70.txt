PV is due to the limited spatial resolution of MRI compared to the size of anatomical structures. Accurate classification of mixed voxels and correct estimation of the proportion of each pure tissue (fractional content) may help to increase the precision of cortical thickness estimation in regions where this measure is particularly difficult, such as deep sulci. The contribution of this work is twofold: on the one hand, we propose a new method to label voxels and compute tissue fractional content, integrating a mechanism for detecting sulci with topology preserving operators. On the other hand, we improve the computation of the fractional content of mixed voxels using local estimation of pure tissue intensity means. Accuracy and precision were assessed using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7592217705154816971", "cites_id": ["7592217705154816971"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027010001147", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yysvDcf5XGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
