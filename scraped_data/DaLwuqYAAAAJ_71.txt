Grey scale texture analysis is a well-established methodology that has been applied to ultrasound images in other fields of medicine. The aim of this study was to determine if this methodology could differentiate between benign and malignant lymphadenopathy of EBUS images.Lymph nodes from digital images of EBUS procedures were manually mapped to obtain a region of interest and were analyzed in a prediction set. The regions of interest were analyzed for the following grey scale texture features in MATLAB (version 7.8.0.347 [R2009a]): mean pixel value, difference between maximal and minimal pixel value, SEM pixel value, entropy, correlation, energy, and homogeneity. Significant grey scale texture features were used to assess a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12817191932831679397", "cites_id": ["12817191932831679397"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369212601615", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pUNvjifQ37EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
