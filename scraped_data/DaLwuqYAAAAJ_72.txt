Participants completed comprehensive neuropsychological testing at baseline 18-, 36-, 54-, and 72-month assessments.Relative to A\u03b2\u2212 CN \u03b54 noncarriers, both A\u03b2+ CN \u03b54 carriers and noncarriers showed significantly increased decline in measures of memory, language, and executive function as well as higher rates of progression to a clinical classification of mild cognitive impairment. Memory decline was greater in A\u03b2+ CN \u03b54 carriers than in A\u03b2+ CN \u03b54 noncarriers. No cognitive decline was evident in A\u03b2\u2212 CN \u03b54 carriers.In CN older adults \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:HoaxrAv1AIcC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2554709076344273116", "cites_id": ["2554709076344273116"], "pub_url": "https://n.neurology.org/content/86/17/1635.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3Hj3l14mdCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 1}}
