However, this test is not always available. Pre\u2010operative diffusion MRI (dMRI) can be used to probe tumour biology using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); however, its ability to act as a surrogate to predict MGMT status has shown mixed results. We investigated whether this was due to variations in the method used to analyse ADC.We undertook a retrospective study of 32 patients with GBM who had MGMT status measured. Matching pre\u2010operative MRI data were used to calculate the ADC within contrast enhancing regions of tumour. The relationship between ADC and MGMT was examined using two published ADC methods.A strong trend between a measure of \u2018minimum ADC\u2019 and methylation status was seen.
