However, no human studies to-date have assessed the relationship between protein and fiber intake, and plasma and brain amyloid-(A). Consequently, this cross-sectional study, investigated the association of self-reported dietary intakes of protein and fiber, with plasma and brain A burden (n= 541, and n= 162 respectively), in a well-characterized cohort of cognitively normal older adults, drawn from the larger Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. We observed 12.59 and 8.43 higher odds of \u2018high\u2019brain A burden (PiB PET SUVR\u2265 1.5) if protein intake fell in the lowest and middle tertile, respectively, compared to the highest tertile (p= 0.008; p= 0.013).
