This includes a high-resolution 3D plant model reconstruction and an automated 3D segmentation. In this paper we present our top-down partitioning pipeline used to automatically segment high-resolution plant meshes. The proposed method produces a smart partition of the initial mesh that allows to identify the main stem, branches, and leaves of the plant. Extracted regions are then processed through the next stage of the automated analysis, which retrieves accurate plant information such as stem length, leaf width, length or area. Results involved applying our top-down approach on a prototype population of 6 cotton-plant meshes studied at 3 or 4 time points. Using our partitioning pipeline, we obtained accurate meshes segmentations for 20 plants out of the initial 22.
