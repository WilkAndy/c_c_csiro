Magnetic resonance imaging can allow the detection of these structural changes, however, large-scale clinical application remains limited by tedious and labor-intensive techniques for volumetric measurement. Towards automating these quantitative measurements, we have currently developed a scheme that allows the automatic segmentation of the menisci from MR images of healthy knees. This scheme utilizes prior automatic bone and cartilage segmentations to provide spatial localization, before shape model fitting and tissue classification are used to segment the menisci. The accuracy and robustness of the approach was experimentally validated using a set of 14 fat suppressed Spoiled Gradient Recall MR images.
