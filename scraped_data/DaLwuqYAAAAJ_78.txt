We hypothesized that different brain networks (i.e., their component fibers) might have different heritability and we investigated brain connectivity using High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) in a cohort of twins comprising 328 subjects that included 70 pairs of monozygotic and 91 pairs of dizygotic twins. Water diffusion was modeled in each voxel with a Fiber Orientation Distribution (FOD) function to study heritability for multiple fiber orientations in each voxel. Precision was estimated in a test\u2013retest experiment on a sub-cohort of 39 subjects. This was taken into account when computing heritability of FOD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_Xy5tTOxz_oC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17015982359043394960", "cites_id": ["17015982359043394960"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914005187", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kE0YD83pJOwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 11, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
