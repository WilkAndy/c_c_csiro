Specifically, a hierarchical 3D\u2010SSM scheme for segmentation of the QL, and surrounding psoas major (PS) and erector spinae+multifidus (ES+MT) musculature, was implemented after image preprocessing (bias field correction, partial volume interpolation) followed by image registration procedures to develop average and probabilistic MR atlases for initializing and constraining the SSM segmentation of the QL.
