CBF changes have been measured using positron emission tomography (PET) across the AD spectrum, but ASL showed limited success in measuring CBF variations in the preclinical phase of AD, where amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques accumulate in the decades prior to symptom onset.To investigate the relationship between CBF measured by multiphase\u2010pseudocontinuous\u2010ASL (MP\u2010PCASL) and A\u03b2 burden as measured by 11C\u2010PiB PET imaging in a study of cognitively normal (CN) subjects age over 65.Cross\u2010sectional.Forty\u2010six CN subjects including 33 with low levels of A\u03b2 burden and 13 with high levels of A\u03b2.3T/3D \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:M6kHaddf_34C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9959615810706557836", "cites_id": ["9959615810706557836"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmri.26810", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jEuHwM-pN4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
