A\u03b2 level was divided using the standardized 0\u2013100 Centiloid scale: <15 CL negative, 15\u201325 CL uncertain, 26\u201350 CL moderate, 51\u2013100 CL high, >100 CL very high, noting >25 CL approximates a positive scan. Cox proportional hazards analysis and linear mixed effect models were used to assess risk of progression and cognitive decline.A\u03b2 levels in 63% were negative, 10% uncertain, 10% moderate, 14% high, and 3% very high. Fifty-seven (11%) progressed to MCI or dementia.
