Reliable automatic extraction of WMH lesions is challenging due to their heterogeneous spatial occurrence, their small size and their diffuse nature. In this paper, we present an automatic method to segment these lesions based on an ensemble of overcomplete patch-based neural networks. The proposed method successfully provides accurate and regular segmentations due to its overcomplete nature while minimizing the segmentation error by using a boosted ensemble of neural networks. The proposed method compared favourably to state of the art techniques using two different neurodegenerative datasets."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_Ycx_gLZKoMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6618945723136642285", "cites_id": ["6618945723136642285"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611118302866", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7YwmBxE421sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
