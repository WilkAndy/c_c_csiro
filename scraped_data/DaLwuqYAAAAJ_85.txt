CMBs are small round hypointense lesions on MRI images that are emerging as a potential biomarker for cerebrovascular disease. CMB manual rating has limited reliability, is time-consuming and is prone to errors as small CMBs can be easily missed or mistaken for venous cross-sections. This paper presents a computer-aided detection technique that utilizes a novel cascade of random forest classifiers which are trained on robust Radon-based features with an unbalanced sample distribution. The training samples and their associated bounding box were acquired from a multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian technique with respect to their geometric characteristics. Validation results demonstrate that the current approach outperforms state \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:RtDPZMhf-s8C", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17410727883612599261", "cites_id": ["17410727883612599261"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6867822/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3bO3n8NUn_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
