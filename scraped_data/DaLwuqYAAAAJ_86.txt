Being a difficult procedure to master, exposure to a large variety of patient and pathology scenarios is crucial for gastroenterologists' training. Currently, most training is done on patients under supervision of experienced gastroenterologists. Being able to undertake a majority of training on simulators would greatly reduce patient risk and discomfort. A next generation colonoscopy simulator is currently under development, which aims to address the shortfalls of existing simulators. The simulator consists of a computer simulation of the colonoscope camera view and a haptic device that allows insertion of an instrumented colonoscope to drive the simulation and provide force feedback to the user. The simulation combines physically accurate models of the colonoscope, colon and surrounding tissues and organs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15877169368931625105", "cites_id": ["15877169368931625105"], "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219467810003731", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kejhkWsJV9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
