As clinical trials move to secondary and even primary prevention, understanding the rates of neocortical A\u03b2-amyloid deposition and the age at which A\u03b2-amyloid deposition becomes abnormal is crucial for optimizing the timing of these trials. As APOE-\u03b54 carriage is thought to modulate the age of clinical onset, it is also important to understand the impact of APOE-\u03b54 carriage on the age at which the neocortical A\u03b2-amyloid deposition becomes abnormal. Here, we show that, for 455 participants with over 3 years of follow-up, abnormal levels of neocortical A\u03b2-amyloid were reached on average at age 72 (66.5\u201377.1). The APOE-\u03b54 carriers reached abnormal levels earlier at age 63 (59.6\u201370.3); however, noncarriers reached the threshold later at age 78 (76.1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:2mus-XyGPC0C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13870218073238821369", "cites_id": ["13870218073238821369"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458020301871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-VmanNnpfMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 11, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
