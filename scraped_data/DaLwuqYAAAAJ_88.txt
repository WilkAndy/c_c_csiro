While AD-related pathology in the brain is well documented, the disease has also been reported to affect the retina, a developmental outgrowth of the brain, which is more accessible for imaging. We describe an eye test for early detection of AD, utilizing Curcumin fluorescence imaging to highlight A\u03b2 aggregates in the retina. This report presents results from analysis of the retinal amyloid test and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET imaging from AD, MCI and HC participants in the AIBL research cohort at the McCusker Alzheimer's Research Foundation in Perth, Australia.MethodsThe trial involves two visits by volunteers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:vuU-T12QLgwC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2053111069446249277", "cites_id": ["2053111069446249277"], "pub_url": "https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jalz.2014.04.341", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PRvEyqMdfhwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
