However, few longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography studies have tested this hypothesis, and with conflicting results. The purpose of this work is to further our understanding of the dynamics of amyloid-\u03b2 deposition in a large longitudinal cohort. A total of 32 patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, 49 subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 103 healthy controls underwent two Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography scans 18\u2009months apart. For each participant, a parametric map of Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography rate of change was created [(follow-up scan\u2009\u2212\u2009baseline scan)/follow-up duration] and entered in a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 260, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1935478231109758404", "cites_id": ["1935478231109758404"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/135/7/2126/353954", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xG3MUzIz3BoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 27, "2014": 33, "2015": 19, "2016": 20, "2017": 24, "2018": 33, "2019": 24, "2020": 17, "2021": 24, "2022": 20, "2023": 11}}
