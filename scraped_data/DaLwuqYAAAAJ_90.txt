Additionally, to determine the extent to which SuperAgers were resilient to the negative effects of elevated amyloid-beta (A\u03b2+) on cognition.Participants were classified as SuperAgers based on episodic memory performance consistent with younger adults aged 30\u201344 and no impairment on non-memory tests (n = 179), and were matched with CNFA on age, sex, education, and follow-up time (n = 179). Subdistribution hazard models examined risk of clinical progression to MCI/dementia. Linear mixed models assessed the effect of A\u03b2 on cognition over time.Prevalence of A\u03b2+ and APOE \u03b54 was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:bgW0xdllhO4C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11604470922322194739", "cites_id": ["11604470922322194739"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/acn/article-abstract/34/5/585/5112955", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MzFdG9JcC6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
