This scheme was trained and evaluated on two sets of small field of view prostate images comprising (i) a set of 15 T2w Fast Spin Echo (FSE) axial MR images; and (ii) a single axial FSE axial MR image; both acquired with surface coils. Our scheme involves several steps, including (i) generation of PAs for the prostate and (ii) segmentation using nonrigid registration based propagation of the PAs. A population of preprocessed images were used to build an average shape atlas. The PAs for the prostate were generated for this atlas by propagating each subject\u2019s manual segmentations. Segmentation was performed by registering the atlas to each preprocessed image and propagating and thresholding the PAs. The automatic segmentation results were compared to the manual segmentations using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) with a median DSC for the prostate of 0.76."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6711365478939203042", "cites_id": ["6711365478939203042"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason-Dowling/publication/228674539_Automatic_atlas-based_segmentation_of_the_prostate_a_miccai_2009_prostate_segmentation_challenge_entry/links/0c9605178a2cf20957000000/Automatic-atlas-based-segmentation-of-the-prostate-a-miccai-2009-prostate-segmentation-challenge-entry.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4pX9QViPI10J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 9, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
