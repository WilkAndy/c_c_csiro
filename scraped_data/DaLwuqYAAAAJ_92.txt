Methods: Fine-Gray subdistribution modeling was used to examine the risk of progression from CN to MCI/dementia due to A+, APOE 4 carriage, and their interaction in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) flagship study of aging CN cohort (n= 599) over 8 years.Results: 17.7% A+ and 8.1% A\u2013progressed over 8 years (OR: 2.43). Risk of progression for A+ was 65\u2013104% greater than A\u2013. A+ APOE 4 carriers were at 348% greater risk than all other participants. Significant risk factors of progression in A+ were age (HR: 1.05), PET SUVR (HR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:9aOYe38lPcwC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1428765174350981916", "cites_id": ["1428765174350981916"], "pub_url": "https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad180507", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HKujLFv-0xMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
