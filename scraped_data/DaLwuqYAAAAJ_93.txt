Compared to invasive perfusion imaging modalities, ASL suffers from low sensitivity due to poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), susceptibility to motion artifacts and low spatial resolution, all of which limit its reliability. In this work, the effects of various state of the art image processing techniques for addressing these ASL limitations are investigated. A processing pipeline consisting of motion correction, ASL motion correction imprecision removal, temporal and spatial filtering, partial volume effect correction, and CBF quantification was developed and assessed. To further improve the SNR for pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) by accounting for errors in tagging efficiency, the data from multiphase (MP) acquisitions were analyzed using a novel weighted-averaging scheme.
