Depressive symptoms were measured with the Geriatric Depression Inventory (GDS-15) in CN adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study without depression at baseline and classified as having abnormally high (A\u03b2+; n = 136) or low (A\u03b2\u2212; n = 449) A\u03b2 according to positron emission tomography at 18-month intervals over 72 months.Incident cases of screen positive depression were not increased in A\u03b2+ CN adults although small increases in overall depressive symptoms severity (d = \u2212 0.25; 95% CI, \u2212 0.45, \u2212 0.05) and apathy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:L_at8tGC9oEC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9343940104467843601", "cites_id": ["9343940104467843601"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032717310030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EQpVyQRYrIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
