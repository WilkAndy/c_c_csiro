This study aimed to determine whether KL-VS associations with cognition were observable in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study also aimed to determine whether there was a combined influence of KL-VS, neocortical amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) burden, and carriage of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele on cognitive decline. This study involved 581 A\u03b2-imaged, cognitively normal older adults, enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Aging. Linear mixed effects models revealed no significant associations between KL-VS and cognitive decline independently or in combination with A\u03b2 burden and APOE \u03b54 genotype. Overall, previous associations reported between KL-VS and cognitive decline are not observed at the preclinical stages of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:cybebCj9Au0C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16942945610307557350", "cites_id": ["16942945610307557350"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458018304548", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5lcl10NvIesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 8}}
