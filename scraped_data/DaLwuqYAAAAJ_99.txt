We sought to identify the determinants of predominant trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms in cognitively normal older adults.Four hundred twenty\u2010three older adults recruited from the general community underwent A\u03b2 positron emission tomography imaging, apolipoprotein and brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor genotyping, and cognitive testing at baseline and had follow\u2010up assessments. All participants were cognitively normal and free of clinical depression at baseline. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify predominant trajectories of subthreshold depressive and anxiety symptoms over 6 years. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify baseline predictors of symptomatic depressive and anxiety trajectories \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "DaLwuqYAAAAJ:GmgqlyE4arsC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16276119196812714017", "cites_id": ["16276119196812714017"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gps.4761", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ISDwxyxk4OEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
