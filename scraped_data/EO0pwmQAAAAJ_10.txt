In the present work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long-term study of the radio and X-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate H1743\u2212322. This source is known to be one of the \u2018outliers\u2019 of the universal radio/X-ray correlation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displaying fainter radio emission for a given X-ray luminosity than expected from the correlation. Our study shows that the radio and X-ray emission of H1743\u2212322 are strongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. However, this correlation is unusually steep for a black hole X-ray binary: b\u223c 1.4 (with Lradio\u221dLbX). Below a critical luminosity, the correlation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b\u223c 0.6. Based on these results, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:SpbQ_efOBbkC", "num_citations": 273, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5209767905856775326", "cites_id": ["5209767905856775326"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/414/1/677/1097547", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nuTSzk7QTEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 22, "2013": 28, "2014": 26, "2015": 27, "2016": 28, "2017": 16, "2018": 22, "2019": 23, "2020": 22, "2021": 21, "2022": 24, "2023": 4}}
