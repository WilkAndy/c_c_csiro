The International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS, http://ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) is a service of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The datasets published here are the results of individual Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) sessions in the form of normal equations in SINEX 2.0 format (http://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Organization/AnalysisCoordinator/SinexFormat/sinex.html, the SINEX 2.0 description is attached as pdf) provided by IVS as the input for the next release of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRF): ITRF2014. This is a new version of the ITRF2008 release (Bockmann et al., 2009). For each session/ file, the normal equation systems contain elements for the coordinate components of all stations having participated in the respective session as well as for the Earth orientation parameters (x-pole, y-pole, UT1 and its time derivatives plus offset to the IAU2006 precession-nutation components dX, dY (https://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2006_Resol1.pdf). The terrestrial part is free of datum. The data sets are the result of a weighted combination of the input of several IVS Analysis Centers. The IVS contribution for ITRF2014 is described in Bachmann et al (2015), Schuh and Behrend (2012) provide a general overview on the VLBI method, details on the internal data handling can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TmnWbB_axlEC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3677394712376047985", "cites_id": ["3677394712376047985"], "pub_url": "https://hal-nantes-universite.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01281368/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cfkS2gG7CDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 14, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 3}}
