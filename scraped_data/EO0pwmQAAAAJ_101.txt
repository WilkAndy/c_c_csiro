The source has an axial ratio of 0.53+ or-0.10 with a major axis of 17.4+ or-0.5 mas. Examination of VLA maps of the Galactic center region indicate no obvious alignment with this smaller-scale elongation of the nuclear region, nor is the nuclear position angle aligned with the axis of Galactic rotation. Comparison with the size measured at frequencies from 1 to 22 GHz shows that the size follows very closely the lambda-squared dependence expected from interstellar scattering. The alongated nature of the source implies either that the scattering medium is anisotropic or that some remnant of the intrinsic structure remains visible through the scattering medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7-gQGTwtAzQC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6230824229560029551", "cites_id": ["6230824229560029551"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989AJ.....98...44J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b5HS3J9VeFYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 7, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
