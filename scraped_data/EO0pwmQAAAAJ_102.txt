By employing a Fourier modeling technique to fit the visibility data, we show that the remnant structure has evolved significantly since day 7000 (mid-2006): the emission latitude has gradually decreased such that the overall geometry has become more similar to a ring structure. Around the same time, we find a decreasing trend in the east\u2013west asymmetry of the surface emissivity. These results could reflect the increasing interaction of the forward shock with material around the circumstellar ring, and the relative weakening of the interaction with the lower-density material at higher latitudes. The morphological evolution caused an apparent break in the remnant expansion measured with a torus model, from a velocity of  km s\u2212 1 between day 4000 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16397436219972615460", "cites_id": ["16397436219972615460"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/777/2/131/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JH2XXl1lj-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
