This data was collected at the ATCA over the last seven years, and establishes unequivocally interstellar scintillation as the principal mechanism responsible for this cm-wavelength intra-day variability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TKTY8N1AUUAC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7026382268757978341", "cites_id": ["7026382268757978341"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ASTR.0000004994.54721.63", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5SxsMXK5gmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
