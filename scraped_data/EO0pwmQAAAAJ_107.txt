The diffraction-limited image has a resolution of about 0 farcs 45, a factor of 2 better than that of the previously obtained 3 cm images. There is excellent agreement between the 12 mm image and a contemporaneous superresolved 3 cm image. Superresolution of the 12 mm image gives a further factor of 2 improvement in resolution, to 0 farcs 25, albeit with limited dynamic range. While the spatial distributions of the radio and X-ray emission are broadly similar, there are significant differences in detail, with no correspondence in the regions of brightest emission. The 12 mm image is well modeled by a thick equatorial ring inclined at 43 to the line of sight.
