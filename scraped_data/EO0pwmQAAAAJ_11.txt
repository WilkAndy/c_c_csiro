In this paper, we report on a series of radio and X-ray observations of the recurrent black hole GX 339\u22124 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and the Swift satellites. With our new long-term campaign, we now have a total of 88 quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of GX 339\u22124 during its hard state, covering a total of seven outbursts over a 15-yr period. Our new measurements represent the largest sample for a stellar mass black hole, without any bias from distance uncertainties, over the largest flux variations and down to a level that could be close to quiescence, making GX 339\u22124 the reference source for comparison with other accreting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:uwWlEQcBbEIC", "num_citations": 267, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1542242660692372683", "cites_id": ["1542242660692372683"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/428/3/2500/1071641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y6wFXIclZxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 19, "2014": 26, "2015": 36, "2016": 31, "2017": 23, "2018": 31, "2019": 19, "2020": 27, "2021": 25, "2022": 27, "2023": 3}}
