The source was found to be double with a component separation of 42.0+/-0.2 mas (84h^-1^ pc for H_0_= 100h km s^-1^ Mpc^-1^), a position angle of 90.5^ deg^+/-1^ deg^, and component sizes of about 2.5 mas. Comparison with single-baseline data taken 12 yr earlier (Gubbay et al. 1971) shows no evidence for any significant change in structure within the reported errors, which places a limit of 0.05 c+/-0.2 c on the expansion velocity. About 40% of the total flux density is seen only on the shorter baselines and is modeled as an additional elongated component aligned with and between the compact double components.
