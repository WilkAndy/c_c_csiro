The 0.3\u20138 keV luminosities are (4.0)\u00d7 10 31 (d/7 kpc) 2 ergs s-1 and (4.2)\u00d7 10 31 (d/11 kpc) 2 ergs s-1 for V4641 Sgr and XTE J1859+ 226, respectively. With the addition of these two systems, 14 out of the 15 transients with confirmed black holes (via compact object mass measurements) now have measured quiescent luminosities or sensitive upper limits. The only exception is GRS 1915+ 105, which has not been in quiescence since its discovery in 1992. The luminosities for V4641 Sgr and XTE J1859+ 226 are consistent with the median luminosity of 2\u00d7 10 31 ergs s-1 for the systems with previous detections. Our analysis suggests that the quiescent X-ray spectrum of V4641 Sgr is harder than for the other systems in this group, but because of the low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:eNpUmiHIC2gC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15307042390526226105", "cites_id": ["15307042390526226105"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/380088/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uW4pOfSJbdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
