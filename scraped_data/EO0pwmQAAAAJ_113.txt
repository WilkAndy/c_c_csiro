We have obtained 22 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data on this source in order to determine the intrinsic angular sizes of the compact components. Previous VLBI observations at lower frequencies indicate that the brightness temperatures of these components are significantly lower than 10 10 K (Jauncey et al.), less than is typical for compact synchrotron radio sources and less than is implied by the short timescales of flux density variations. A possible explanation is that interstellar scattering is broadening the apparent angular size of the source and thereby reducing the observed brightness temperature. Our VLBA data support this hypothesis. At 22 GHz, the measured brightness temperature is at least 10 11 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GK0_TXnxOL4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17992777564652607231", "cites_id": ["17992777564652607231"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/310292/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_5a8f90vs_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
