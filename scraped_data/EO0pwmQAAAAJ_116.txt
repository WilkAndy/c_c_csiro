The selected objects are 3C17, PKS 0620-52, PKS 0625-35, PKS 1318-43, PKS 1333-33 and 3C317. The first is a high power radio galaxy and the remainder are low power objects. Our observations were carried out with a set of different arrays and frequencies, and cover a range of resolutions from a few mas to a few tens of mas. Parsec-scale images are presented and discussed in the light of unification for radio loud galaxies. Estimates for the intrinsic plasma speed in these objects in the proximity of the parsec-scale core and tehir orientation to the line of sight are in agreement with the predictions from unified models and their optical and X-ray properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:I6TX2FUo6loC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5343044217568899848", "cites_id": ["5343044217568899848"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CDNmP2hOJkoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
