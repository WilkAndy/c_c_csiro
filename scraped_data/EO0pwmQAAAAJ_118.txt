We observed MAXI J1348\u2013630 for \u223c14 months in the radio band with MeerKAT and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, and in the X-rays with MAXI and Swift/XRT. Throughout the outburst, we detected and tracked the evolution of compact and transient jets. Following the main outburst, the system underwent at least four hard-state-only re-flares, during which compact jets were again detected. For the major outburst, we observed the rise, quenching and reactivation of compact jets, as well as two single-sided discrete ejecta travelling away from the BH, launched \u223c2 months apart. These ejecta displayed the highest proper motion (\u2273100 mas d\u22121) ever measured for an accreting BH binary. From the jet motion, we constrain the ejecta \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:vj8KeYadoLsC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1682103481549301908", "cites_id": ["1682103481549301908"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/504/1/444/6189696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lKgxTTQIWBcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 20, "2023": 10}}
