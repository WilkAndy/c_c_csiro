Neither system was detected. Radio flux density upper limits (3\u03c3) of 26 \u03bcJy (at 5.5 GHz), 47 \u03bcJy (at 9 GHz) for GRO J1655\u221240 and 1.4 mJy (at 1.75 GHz), 27 \u03bcJy (at 5.5 GHz), 47 \u03bcJy (at 9 GHz) for XTE J1550\u2212564 were measured. In conjunction with quasi-simultaneous Chandra X-ray observations (in the case of GRO J1655\u221240) and Faulkes Telescope optical observations (XTE J1550\u2212564) we find that these systems provide the first evidence of relatively \u2018radio-quiet\u2019 black hole binaries at low luminosities, indicating that the scatter observed in the hard state X-ray\u2013radio correlation at higher luminosities may also extend towards quiescent levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:CxegcQ4u50YC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7148802004410782203", "cites_id": ["7148802004410782203"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/409/2/839/1040159", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-1GBCoylNWMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
