Gamma-ray (\u03b3-ray) blazars have been predicted to yield a cumulative neutrino signal exceeding the atmospheric background above energies of 100\u2009TeV, assuming that both the neutrinos and the \u03b3-ray photons are produced by accelerated protons in relativistic jets. As the background spectrum falls steeply with increasing energy, the individual events with the clearest signature of being of extraterrestrial origin are those at petaelectronvolt energies. Inside the large positional-uncertainty fields of the first two petaelectronvolt neutrinos detected by IceCube, the integrated emission of the blazar population has a sufficiently high electromagnetic flux to explain the detected IceCube events, but fluences of individual objects are too low to make an unambiguous source association \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:tKAXkfz_euYC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17854002298193726680", "cites_id": ["17854002298193726680"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3715", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2EzY4n4oxvcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 45, "2018": 38, "2019": 37, "2020": 19, "2021": 29, "2022": 35, "2023": 11}}
