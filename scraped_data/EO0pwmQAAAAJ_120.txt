These data constitute a significant addition to our knowledge of powerful radio galaxies on the smallest scales, effectively doubling the number studied at this resolution. The jet, 14 h-1 pc in projected extent, is directed west of the core for the first 5 h-1 pc and then appears to bend approximately 40 to the north. Apparent motions for three of the five parsec-scale jet components have been estimated, 0.5\u00b10.4, 1.1\u00b10.5, and 0.4\u00b10.7 h-1 c, indicating that subluminal motion is likely. No parsec-scale counterjet has been detected, allowing only lower limits on the jet-to-counterjet surface brightness ratio to be estimated. Two models, one describing the apparent 40 bend in the parsec-scale jet as an intrinsic deflection of the jet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6XuKD3u7GOoC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13462786832511780922", "cites_id": ["13462786832511780922"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/301283/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Osirlktt1boJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
