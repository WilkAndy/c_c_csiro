The continuum structure is dominated by two spurs of emission, which probably originate in the core and extend roughly along the minor axis of the galaxy. In addition, the OH absorption profiles clearly indicate a rapidly rotating cloud surrounding the nucleus or several independent clouds in the vicinity with inflowing and outflowing motions. The Circinus Galaxy is most probably a Seyfert with underlying nuclear starburst activity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:bjlTY1bLvvcC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6099210944175332998", "cites_id": ["6099210944175332998"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1990MNRAS.244..130H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ht6-6QnApFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 7, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
