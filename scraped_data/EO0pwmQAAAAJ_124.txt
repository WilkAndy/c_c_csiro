The system shows significant variations in the morphology and brightness of the radio features on all time-scales from days to years. Using the time delay between the successive brightening of the different components of the radio emission we were able to provide further evidence for the relativistic nature of the arcsec-scale outflow, with an apparent velocity \u03b2app\u2265 12. No compelling evidence for an evolution of the orientation of the jet axis was found. We also place an upper limit on the proper motion of the system which is consistent with previous optical studies. Besides the previously reported radio flares close to the orbital phase 0.0 (interpreted as enhanced accretion at periastron passage), we identified \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6339511200476353232", "cites_id": ["6339511200476353232"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/390/1/447/975194", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0NIAQtl3-lcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
