The supernova ejecta initially coasted outward at more than 10% of the speed of light, but in 1990 were observed to decelerate rapidly as they began to encounter dense circumstellar material expelled by the progenitor star The resulting shock has subsequently produced steadily brightening radio synchrotron emission, which is resolved by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) into an expanding limb\u2010brightened shell. Here we present 15 years of ATCA imaging of Supernova 1987A, at an effective angular resolution of 0.\u201d4. We find that the radio remnant has accelerated in its expansion over this period, from \u2248 3600 km s\u22121 in 1992 to \u2248 5200 km s\u22121 at the end of 2006. The published diameters of the evolving X\u2010ray shell have been \u223c 15% smaller than the corresponding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lAkp0ULYU5cC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2444600767057889949", "cites_id": ["2444600767057889949"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3682887", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nQoiEnL37CEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
