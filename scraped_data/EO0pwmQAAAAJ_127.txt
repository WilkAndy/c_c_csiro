The correlation between 5 GHz and X-ray luminosities of RQ AGN, which follows LR = 10\u22125LX observed also in stellar coronae, suggests an association of both X-ray and radio sources with the accretion disc corona. Observing RQ AGN at higher (mm-wave) frequencies, where synchrotron self-absorption is diminished, and smaller regions can be probed, is key to exploring this association. Eight RQ AGN, selected based on their high X-ray brightness and variability, were observed at 95 GHz with the CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimetre-wave Astronomy) and ATCA (the Australia Telescope Compact Array) telescopes. All targets were detected at the 1\u201310 mJy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:V6rzEKW62mYC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5926295220822967569", "cites_id": ["5926295220822967569"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/451/1/517/1377861", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EYU_vxpuPlIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 7}}
