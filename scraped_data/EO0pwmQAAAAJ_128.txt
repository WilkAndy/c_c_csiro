The high radio luminosity of this supernova seems to require relativistic outflow, implying that the early radio emission was\" engine-driven,\" that is, driven by collimated outflow from a compact object, even though no gamma-ray emission was seen. The radio light curve shows a general decline, with a\" bump\" near t= 52 d, seen most prominently at 5 GHz. The light-curve bump could be either engine-driven or it might represent the turn-on of the normal radio emission from a supernova, driven by interaction with the circumstellar material rather than by the engine. We undertook VLBI observations to resolve SN 2009bb's relativistic outflow. Our observations constrain the angular outer radius at an age of 85 d to be< 0.64 mas, corresponding to< 4\u00d7 10 17 cm and an average apparent expansion speed of< 1.74 c.
