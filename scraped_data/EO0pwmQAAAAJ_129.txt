Based on Hi spectra, we constrain the source distance to between 3.3 and 4.9 kpc. The radio images, taken some 2 d apart, show the evolution of an ejection event. The apparent separation velocity of the two outermost ejecta is at least 1.3c and may be as large as 1.9c; when relativistic effects are taken into account, the inferred true velocity is \u2265 0.8c. The flux densities appear to peak simultaneously during the outburst, with a rather flat (although still optically thin) spectral index of \u22120.2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:-LBJnDjEUMIC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15590857845279437561", "cites_id": ["15590857845279437561"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/397/1/569/1007927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-TJ-O5vaXdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
