Radio positions with an accuracy of typically 0.3 arcsec rms were measured from the observed delay and fringe rate of VLBI observations at 2.29 GHz on an Australia to South Africa baseline. Optical identifications and positions were measured from the UK Schmidt Telescope deep IIIa-J Southern Sky Survey plates, where available."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ggypx7smY2AC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6638675867308952184", "cites_id": ["6638675867308952184"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1989AJ.....98...54J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eIroMYdQIVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
