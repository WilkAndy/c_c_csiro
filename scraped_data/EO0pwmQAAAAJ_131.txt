Specifically, we imaged Westerlund 2 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys through the , , and  filters and with the Wide Field Camera 3 in the , , and  filters. We derive the first high resolution pixel-to-pixel map of the color excess  of the gas associated with the cluster, combining the H\u03b1 () and Pa\u03b2 () line observations. We demonstrate that, as expected, the region is affected by significant differential reddening with a median of  mag. After separating the populations of cluster members and foreground contaminants using a  versus  color\u2013magnitude diagram, we identify a pronounced pre-main-sequence population in Westerlund 2 showing a distinct turn-on.
