They interpreted these lines as indicative of a baryonic jet launched by the accretion disk. Here we present a search for the same lines earlier in the same outburst using high-resolution X-ray spectra from the Chandra HETGS. While our observations (eight months prior to the XMM-Newton campaign) also coincide with detections of steep spectrum radio emission by the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find no evidence for any relativistic X-ray emission lines. Indeed, despite\u223c 5\u00d7 brighter radio emission, our Chandra spectra allow us to place an upper limit on the flux in the blueshifted Fe xxvi line that is\u2273 20\u00d7 weaker than the line observed by D\u00edaz Trigo et al.
