These very long baseline interferometry observations represent the first scientific results from a new antenna in New Zealand and the first antenna of the Australian SKA Pathfinder. A compact double radio source, PKS 1934\u2212 638 has been monitored over a period of 40 years and the observation described here provides the latest datum, eight years after the previous observation, to aid in the study of the long-term evolution of the source structure. We take advantage of these new long baselines to probe PKS 1934\u2212 638 at the relatively low frequency of 1.4 GHz in order to examine the effects of optical depth on the structure of the radio source. Optical depth effects, resulting in the observation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GjQuYujAsN4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18268671409040677405", "cites_id": ["18268671409040677405"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/140/5/1506/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HVo03tpbh_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
