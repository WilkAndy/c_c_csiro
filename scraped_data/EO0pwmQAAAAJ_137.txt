PKS 1549\u221279 is one of the closest young, radio-loud quasars caught in an on-going merger in which the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is in the first phases of its evolution. We detect three structures tracing the accretion and the outflow of molecular gas: kpc-scale tails of gas accreting onto PKS 1549\u221279 from a merger, a circumnuclear disc in the inner few hundred parsec, and a very broad (> 2300 km s\u22121) component detected in CO(1\u22120) at the position of the AGN. Thus, in PKS 1549\u221279 we see the co-existence of accretion and the ejection of gas. The line ratio CO(3\u22122)/CO(1\u22120) suggests that the gas in the circumnuclear-disc has both high densities and high kinetic temperatures.
