At a distance of 19 Mpc, PKS B2254\u2212367 is one of the closest known GPS radio sources. IC 1459, NGC 1052 (18 Mpc) and NGC 6328 (56 Mpc) are the only GPS radio source host galaxies for which the detailed kinematics of the host galaxies can be studied. All three galaxies present strong evidence for merger activity, an actively fuelled black hole and high-density environments with which the radio sources interact. Although radio luminosity evolution is generally invoked to explain the apparent overabundance of GPS sources relative to radio galaxies, such strong evidence for merger-induced activity in the nuclei of nearby GPS host galaxies argues that at least some GPS radio sources are limited in their development by the effects of merger activity and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:0ju6dEALV5wC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13946396670918858931", "cites_id": ["13946396670918858931"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/346/1/327/2891830", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sxjPiuGNi8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
