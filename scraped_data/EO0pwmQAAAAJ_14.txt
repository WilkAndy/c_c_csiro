If intrinsic to the source, these variations would imply a brightness temperature T \u223c 10 K, some 9 orders of magnitude larger than the inverse Compton limit for a static synchrotron source, and still a million times greater than can be accommodated with bulk relativistic motion at a Lorentz factor \u03b3\u223c 10. The variability is intermittent with episodes lasting a few weeks to months."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:zI9YInTrFVIC", "num_citations": 222, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14969914505205762438", "cites_id": ["14969914505205762438"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/311001/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hsnBsO3Rv88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 12, "2000": 13, "2001": 25, "2002": 16, "2003": 18, "2004": 8, "2005": 11, "2006": 15, "2007": 18, "2008": 10, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
