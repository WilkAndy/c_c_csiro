This monitoring data, together with VLBI monitoring data, shows that a small fraction of these sources, \u223c10%, vary. Their variability falls into several categories: sources whose spectral classification is, at best, ephemeral on a timescale of years; sources with a stable GPS classification that vary, but retain their classification; and a small number of sources that exhibit interstellar scintillation, but that maintain a mean GPS spectrum. Existing data on GPS sources with higher frequency peaks, \u22653 GHz, reveals that many such sources vary. However, the majority of these sources possess a GPS spectrum only during outbursts, and hence should perhaps be classified as ephemeral GPS sources. In addition, significant levels of circular polarisation have been found in a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:9hYaGTfn7EkC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16658807783776407103", "cites_id": ["16658807783776407103"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/variability-in-gps-sources/5526678712DFB28D69CDED03BC4448D4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P06BzWr5L-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
