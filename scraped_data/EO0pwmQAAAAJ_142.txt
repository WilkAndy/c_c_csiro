The source was almost continuously observed with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2016 December until 2017 October. The X-ray hardness ratio and timing evolution indicate that the source approached the soft state three times during the outburst, even though it never reached the canonical soft spectral state. Thus, GRS 1716\u2013249 increases the number of black hole transients showing outbursts with \u2018failed\u2019 state transition. During the softening events, XRT and BAT broad-band spectral modelling, performed with thermal Comptonization plus a multicolour disc black-body, showed a photon index (\u0393 < 2) and an inner disc temperature (kTin = 0.2\u20130.5\u2009keV) characteristic of the hard intermediate state. This is in agreement with the root mean square \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Zk83zdSX4-UC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18314393957946805662", "cites_id": ["18314393957946805662"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/482/2/1587/5124397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ns36W0XMKf4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 5}}
