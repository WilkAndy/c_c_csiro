The angular extent of the resolved jets is \u223c20 mas, corresponding to a physical scale of \u223c150 au at the assumed distance of 7.8 kpc. The jet position angle is relatively consistent with previous arcsecond-scale imaging with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The radio emission is symmetric about the peak, and is unresolved along the minor axis, constraining the opening angle to be <20\u00b0. We observe evidence for outward motion of the components between the two halves of the observation. Constraints on the proper motion of the radio-emitting components suggest that they are only mildly relativistic, although we cannot definitively rule out the presence of the unseen, ultrarelativistic (\u0393 > 15) flow previously inferred to exist in this system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6daZS1cS2l8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3594328670647856673", "cites_id": ["3594328670647856673"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/419/1/L49/1029211", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ia734-Ge4TEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
