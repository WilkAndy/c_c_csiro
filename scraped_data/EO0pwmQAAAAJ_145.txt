A large radio flare was observed, peaking about 1.8 days after the X-ray flare. In addition, we present Australian Long Baseline Array images obtained shortly after the maximum of the radio flare which show evolving structure. The apparent separation velocity of the two outermost components is v>2c."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:UWSlATeI89AC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8135074871102607900", "cites_id": ["8135074871102607900"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0102070", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HBJHaX6X5XAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
