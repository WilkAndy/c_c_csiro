We present the radio and \u03b3-rayproperties of the TANAMI sources based on one year of contemporaneous TANAMI and Fermi/LAT data. A large fraction (72%) of the TANAMI sample can be associated with bright \u03b3-ray sources for this time range. Association rates differ for different optical classes with all BL\u2009Lacs, 76% of quasars, and just 17% of galaxies detected by the LAT. Upper limits were established on the \u03b3-ray flux from TANAMI sources not detected by LAT. This analysis led to the identification of three new Fermi sources whose detection was later confirmed. The \u03b3-ray and radio luminosities are related by L\u03b3 \u221d Lr0.89\u00b10.04.
