Here we report on the first VLBI observations, and detection, undertaken in the 25 years since the 1975\u20131985 period of strong recurrent flaring activity. We detected Circinus X-1 with the first observations conducted by a recently developed Southern hemisphere e-VLBI array, at both 1.6 and 8.4 GHz, over a three-day period. At 1.6 GHz, the compact source has a total flux density of 11 mJy and a size of 60 \u00b1 15 mas (Gaussian model full width at half maximum). At 8.4 GHz, the compact source is less than 60 mas. The size variation with frequency is consistent with a broadened image due to scattering in the turbulent, ionized interstellar medium of our Galaxy. However, these size measurements appear inconsistent with the \u03bb2.2 variation expected for strong interstellar scattering and previous VLBI observations made at 2.3 GHz in the early 1980s \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Yeq4f8IuGg4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8422433991133158688", "cites_id": ["8422433991133158688"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/380/1/L11/1016758", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IN2qSRd_4nQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
