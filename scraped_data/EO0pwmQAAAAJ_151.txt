We briefly summarize the difficulties of stellar dynamical searches, then show that recently discovered relations between black hole mass, X-ray luminosity and radio luminosity imply that in most cases, these black holes should be more easily detected in the radio than in the X-rays. Finally, we show upper limits from some radio observations of globular clusters, and discuss the possibility that the radio source in the core of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy might be a \u223c10,000\u2013100,000 M\u2299 black hole."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12499174095071212132", "cites_id": ["12499174095071212132"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-005-1188-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZPJ7sp38da0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
