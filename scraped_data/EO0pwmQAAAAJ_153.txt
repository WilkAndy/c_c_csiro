Photometric observations show the system to be highly active with multiple flares on hourly time-scales over the one month observing programme. Analysis of the power spectrum of the source show no persistent periodicities in these data, and no evidence of the 4.8-h orbital period. An upper limit of 15 mJy can be placed on the amplitude of any sinusoidal variation of source flux at the orbital period. The brightness temperature of a flare is typically Tb\u2265109\u20131010 K, with a number of small flares of 5-min duration having brightness temperatures of Tb\u2265 few \u00d7 1011 K. For such a change in flux to occur within a typical 10-min time-scale, the radiation must originate from plasmons with a size \u22641.22 au. This emission is unlikely to originate close to the centre of the system as both the jets and compact object are buried deep within \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:IT1MJ6E3JesC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2847964648638783669", "cites_id": ["2847964648638783669"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/326/1/349/1027328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tSD8PsIAhicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
