Here, we present a large data set of quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of the recently discovered accreting BH MAXI J1348\u2013630 during its 2019/2020 outburst. Our results span almost six orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity, allowing us to probe the accretion\u2013ejection coupling from the brightest to the faintest phases of the outburst. We find that MAXI J1348\u2013630 belongs to the growing population of outliers at the highest observed luminosities. Interestingly, MAXI J1348\u2013630 deviates from the outlier track at LX \u2272 7 \u00d7 1035(D/2.2\u2009 kpc)2 erg s\u22121 and ultimately rejoins the standard track at LX \u2243 1033(D/2.2 kpc)2 erg s\u22121, displaying a hybrid radio/X-ray correlation, observed only in a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nwfoItMF7hMC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2556382190470613735", "cites_id": ["2556382190470613735"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/505/1/L58/6279694", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:58oi1Q4YeiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
