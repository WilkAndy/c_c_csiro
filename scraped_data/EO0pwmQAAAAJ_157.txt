The nuclear radio jet is approximately 50 milliarcseconds in extent, or at the 3.5-megaparsec distance of NGC5128, approximately 1 parsec in length. Subluminal motion is seen and structural changes are observed on time scales shorter than 4 months. High-resolution observations at 4.8 and 8.4 GHz made in November 1992 reveal a complex morphology and allow us to unambiguously identify the self-absorbed core located at the southwestern end of the jet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:CQrscp367IIC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16627939347838787382", "cites_id": ["16627939347838787382"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.92.25.11368", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nt-r_rxOwuYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
