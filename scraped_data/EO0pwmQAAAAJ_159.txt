We find little evidence for extinction within the central regions, thus supporting a previous hypothesis in which the interstellar medium of the Seyfert galaxy has been stripped during a recent merger. The radio structure is resolved into a linear feature misaligned by  with respect to the position angle defining the two near-IR nuclei. This suggests that the previously observed optical line emission within the western (Seyfert) nucleus is not due to any narrow-line region or extended narrow-line region associated with the radio elliptical, thus distinguishing PKS 1345 + 125 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16586291320177365925", "cites_id": ["16586291320177365925"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/256/1/6P/1024978", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pRNR6BNYLuYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
