We present VLBI observations of the methanol maser source G309. 92+ 0.48, in the 12.2 GHz (2 0\u20133-1 E) transition, which confirm previous observations that the masers in this source lie along a line. We show that such sources are not only linear in space but, in many cases, also have a linear velocity gradient. We then model these and other data in both the 6.7 GHz (5 1\u20136 0 A+) and the 12.2 GHz (2 0\u20133-1 E) transition from a number of star formation regions and show that the observed spatial and velocity distribution of methanol masers, and the derived Keplerian masses, are consistent with a circumstellar disk rotating around an OB star. We consider this and other hypotheses and conclude that about half \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yG6gRY0c4kQC", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5606048372272974150", "cites_id": ["5606048372272974150"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/306373/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Rsn83kqvzE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 13, "2001": 6, "2002": 13, "2003": 10, "2004": 19, "2005": 24, "2006": 8, "2007": 12, "2008": 9, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 10, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
