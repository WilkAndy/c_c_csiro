We use Fourier modeling of the supernova remnant to model its morphology, using both a torus model and a ring model, and find that both models show an increasing flux density and have shown a continuing expansion of the remnant. As found in previous studies, we find that the torus model most accurately fits our data and has shown a change in the remnant expansion at day 9300\u00b1210 from 2300\u00b1200 km s\u2212 1 to 3610\u00b1240 km s\u2212 1. We have also seen an increase in brightness in the western lobe of the remnant, although the eastern lobe is still the dominant source of emission, unlike what has been observed at contemporary optical and X-ray wavelengths. We expect to observe a reversal in this asymmetry by the year\u223c \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:IrOsW1AMYYMC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13202073442739231880", "cites_id": ["13202073442739231880"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae261/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iBwXPdkvN7cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
