Tadhunter et al.[MNRAS, 235,403 (1988)] have identified this object as one in which the radio axis and optical emission line features on the kiloparsec-scale appear to have an obvious connection but are somewhat misaligned. They interpret this relationship as most likely being due to an interaction between the radio jet and an extra-nuclear cloud of gas, the misalignment possibly caused by the deflection of the radio jet in the interaction. The VLBI observations presented here further strengthen the evidence for the interaction interpretation. The parsec-scale radio jet aligns strongly with optical emission line features, and not with the kiloparsec-scale radio structure.
