In 1998 January the EGRET instrument on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory detected a bright high-energy \u03b3-ray outburst from its direction. Thus, we had the unique opportunity to monitor the source in detail at various radio frequencies already before the detection of the \u03b3-ray outburst. We also initiated multiwavelength follow-up observations. In this paper we present multiwavelength data for PKS 2255-282 before and after the \u03b3-ray outburst. Further, based on the observations, we estimate some physical parameters for this source and discuss the various emission mechanisms possibly involved during this outburst."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:SVv6S0jguFwC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11689724952148763064", "cites_id": ["11689724952148763064"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/301019/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uOHYvug-OqIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 3}}
