The jet is spatially resolved in both observing windows. The X-ray jet is expanding in time along the axis of the jet's propagation: we observe the formation of a tail (\u223c2.25\u2009arcsec), which appears to extend backwards with an apparent velocity \u223c\u22120.10c. The origin of this feature is discussed in the framework of scenarios of energy dissipation. A single power law adequately describes the broad-band spectra, supporting a synchrotron origin of the X-ray emission. However, a spectral break at \u22481015\u2009Hz is necessary in coincidence with a re-flare at 8.64 GHz in 2002 September. This finding may be indicative of emission from newly accelerated low-energy particles. The first detection of the jet is in 2001 February (F8.64 GHz = 0.25 \u00b1 0.09\u2009mJy) in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lgavJseCKEcC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12180678175648709747", "cites_id": ["12180678175648709747"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/472/1/141/4033109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c_zkxkN2CqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
