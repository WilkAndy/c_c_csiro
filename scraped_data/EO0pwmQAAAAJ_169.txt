We infer the diameter as a function of pulse phase from the distribution of visibility on the Mopra\u2013Tidbinbilla baseline. As we demonstrate, in the presence of strong scintillation, finite size of the emission region produces a characteristic W-shaped signature in the projection of the visibility distribution onto the real axis. This modification involves heightened probability density near the mean amplitude, decreased probability to either side, and a return to the zero-size distribution beyond. We observe this signature with high statistical significance, as compared with the best-fitting zero-size model, in many regions of pulse phase. We find that the equivalent FWHM of the pulsar's emission region decreases from more than 400 km early in the pulse to near zero at the peak of the pulse and then \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:B-V0BYNYc0AC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7326922955625998233", "cites_id": ["7326922955625998233"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/758/1/7/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mSe-wpt1rmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
