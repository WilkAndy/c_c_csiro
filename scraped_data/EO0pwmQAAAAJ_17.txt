The bright jet contains components that have subluminal speeds of approximately 0.1c and undergo irregular episodes of rapid internal evolution. The rapid evolution sometimes observed could be interpreted as evidence for an underlying jet flow much faster (> 0.45c) than observed from the proper motion of components (\u223c 0.1c). Considering the large-scale morphology of the source, the motions and temporal variations in the jet, and the detection of a counterjet, we conclude that the axis of the Cen A jet lies between\u223c 50 and\u223c 80 to our line of sight. We find that the estimated times of component ejection from the compact core are reasonably coincident with enhancements in hard X-ray intensity and 22 GHz flux density. In the context of the radio galaxy population, Cen A is a low-luminosity FR I\u2013type source and in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:X8aq8RHJ9bUC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=524874990166386952", "cites_id": ["524874990166386952"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300257/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CKlazAW7SAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 11, "2000": 10, "2001": 9, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 12, "2010": 23, "2011": 14, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
