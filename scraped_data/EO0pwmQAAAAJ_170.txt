The sources were selected to include the known strong southern IDV sources plus a number of sources whose IDV was recently discovered. The present monitoring program will extend over a full year in order to search for any annual cycle that may be present in the long-term IDV characteristics of these sources. In this paper we discuss the observing strategy and data analysis, and present the first results from our observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:luR84W4EXegC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10633190843564340178", "cites_id": ["10633190843564340178"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/as/AS01101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0rOWM7yukJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2}}
