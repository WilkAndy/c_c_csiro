These properties are usually attributed to relativistic motion of nuclear jets in sources inclined at small angles to the line of sight. From a large survey of possible one-sided sources made with both MERLIN and the Very Large Array, we have been able to identify a class of one-sided sources that are dominated by their extended emission while the lower limits on their degree of asymmetry, inferred from our MERLIN observations, are amongst the highest known. These weak-cored one-sided sources appear to be inconsistent with the 'unified scheme9\u201315, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1281152911348082200", "cites_id": ["1281152911348082200"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/339286a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GCbc98iRxxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
