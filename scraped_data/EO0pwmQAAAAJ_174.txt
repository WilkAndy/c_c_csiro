Interstellar medium absorption lines in the X-shooter spectrum allow us to determine  along the line of sight to the source. We also report detection of emission signatures of He ii , H\u03b1, and, for the first time, H i  and Pa\u03b2. The double-peaked morphology of these four lines is typical of the chromosphere of a rotating accretion disk. Nonetheless, the paucity of disk features points toward a low level of irradiation in the system. This is confirmed through spectral energy distribution modeling, and we find that the UVOT+ X-shooter continuum mostly stems from the thermal emission of a viscous disk.
