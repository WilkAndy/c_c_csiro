These observations are associated with the re-appearance of GX 339-4 as a bright X-ray source following approximately three years in an\" Off\" state, and subsequent transition to the current extremely bright X-ray state. Three sets of observations between MJD 52368-52382 revealed a radio source with an approximately flat spectrum between 1-9 GHz, at a level between 5-14 mJy, characteristic of the low/hard X-ray state."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:qyimiW2FXDQC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13889217161589509832", "cites_id": ["13889217161589509832"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ATel..107....1F/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yE7NlGtpwMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
