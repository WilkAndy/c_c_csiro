We present the results of a high angular resolution monitoring campaign conducted with the Australian Long Baseline Array in real-time e-VLBI mode. e-VLBI observations of Circinus X-1 were made on alternate days over a period of 20 d covering the full binary orbit. A compact radio source associated with Circinus X-1 was clearly detected at orbital phases following periastron passage, but no compact radio emission was detected at any other orbital phase, ruling out the presence of a persistent, compact emitting region at our sensitivity levels. The jet was not resolved at any epoch of our 1.4-GHz monitoring campaign, suggesting that the ultrarelativistic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:1vh4mnD7xAIC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15548847323222216516", "cites_id": ["15548847323222216516"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/414/4/3551/998994", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RI9xV0KayNcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
