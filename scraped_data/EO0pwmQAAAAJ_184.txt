This was the first geodetic VLBI observing session with the participation of these new stations. We have determined the positions of ASKAP-29 and WARK12M. Random errors on position estimates are 150\u2013200 mm for the vertical component and 40\u201350 mm for the horizontal component. Systematic errors caused by the unmodeled ionosphere path delay may reach 1.3 m for the vertical component."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:vQKLzKM0twkC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1095491083122926831", "cites_id": ["1095491083122926831"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/first-geodetic-observations-using-new-vlbi-stations-askap29-and-wark12m/0D324B1661C45E33F560516257194B89", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:72QmAFb3Mw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3}}
