The discovery of three rapid intra-day variability sources, PKS 0405\u2212 385, PKS1267\u2212 326 and J1819+ 3845, has been largely responsible for this new paradigm. We present here recent results for the two southern sources PKS 0405\u2212 385 and PKS 1257\u2212 326, together with observations and first results from the MASIV (Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability) survey that we are undertaking at 5 GHz with the VLA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:K0fIQ6b0NmsC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3224012403607385085", "cites_id": ["3224012403607385085"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2003ASPC..300..199J", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_bN4FDP-vSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
