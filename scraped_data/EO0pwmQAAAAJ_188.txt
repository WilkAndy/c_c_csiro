A first contemporaneous OSSE, COMPTEL, and EGRET spectrum obtained in October 1991 covers an energy range from 50 keV up to 1 GeV. This \u03b3-ray broad-band spectrum was taken when Cen A was in an intermediate emission state as defined by the BATSE X-ray light-curve. The first simultaneous multiwavelength spectrum from radio to \u03b3-rays was measured in July 1995 when Cen A was in a low emission state (the prevailing state for the last 7 years). The different spatial and temporal resolution in the different frequency regimes produces problems in the construction and interpretation of the multiwavelength spectra. These are addressed in this paper. The detection of emission > 1 MeV makes the inclusion of such high-energy emission into models for the spectral energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11733024952882203328", "cites_id": ["11733024952882203328"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117799002392", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wIpWyQcU1KIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2}}
