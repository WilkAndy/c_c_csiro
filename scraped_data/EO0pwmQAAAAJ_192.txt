None of these sources is detected at their optical positions, to 3 sigma limits of a few hundred micro-Jy. This places upper limits on their radio luminosities and thus on the internal energy and numbers of any relativistic electrons which are three to four orders of magnitude below those of radio-bright X-ray binaries such as SS 433 and Cyg X-3. Spectral and structural information on the proposed `radio lobes' of GX 1+4 make their association with the source unlikely. The lack of detected radio emission from any X-ray pulsar system is discussed statistically, and it is found that X-ray pulsations and radio emission from X-ray binaries are strongly anti-correlated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7307169054040600540", "cites_id": ["7307169054040600540"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9612080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3C_RI4pHaGUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
