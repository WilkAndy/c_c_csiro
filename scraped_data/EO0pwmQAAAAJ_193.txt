At a distance of 4 Mpc, Centaurus A is the closest active radio galaxy and affords the highest linear imaging resolution (1 mas ~ 0\u00b702 pc) and hence the best prospects for studying an active nucleus close to the central radio source. We present the results of multi-epoch, 8\u00b7 4-G Hz, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), imaging observations of the nucleus made over the past three years. The nucleus possesses a core-jet structure where the inner portion of the jet shows apparent linear motion with a velocity substantially less than the speed of light."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:MZHH0dlIDt0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14017443717495340806", "cites_id": ["14017443717495340806"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/PH/PH940619", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bj9XIMv2h8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
