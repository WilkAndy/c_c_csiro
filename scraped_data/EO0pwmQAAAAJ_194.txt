Here we report new constraints on these issues, through the long term study of the radio and X-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate H 1743\u2013322. This source is known to be one of the \u201coutliers\u201d of the universal radio/X-ray correlation, i.e. a group of stellar mass accreting black holes displaying fainter radio emission for a given X-ray luminosity, than expected from the correlation. In this work we find, at high X-ray luminosity in the hard state, a tight radio/X-ray correlation with an unusual steep slope of b = 1.38 \u00b1 0.03. This correlation then breaks below ~5 \u00d7 10\u22123LEdd (M/10M\u2299)\u22121 in X-rays and becomes shallower. When compared with radio/X-ray data from other black hole X-ray binaries, we see that the deviant points of H 1743\u2013322 join the universal correlation and seem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:wTlTSBh5aqwC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3541612738639979811", "cites_id": ["3541612738639979811"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/accretionoutflow-connection-in-the-outliers-of-the-universal-radioxray-correlation/2D41CC43B302869A6E39BE5901475B38", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I2WiggVWJjEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
