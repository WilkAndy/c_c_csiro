The radio source has risen from the previous~ 2 mJy plateau to 20 mJy at 1.2, 2.5, 5.5, 9, 17, 19 GHz on January 21."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:g4gGp8M7V98C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5492933566597216636", "cites_id": ["5492933566597216636"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ATel.2400....1B/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fLnY2_nROkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
