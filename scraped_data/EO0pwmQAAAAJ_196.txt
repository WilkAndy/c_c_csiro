The positions are derived from Mark III/IV very long baseline interferometry observations made between 2004 August and 2006 April using radio telescopes located in Australia, South Africa, and Hawaii. Positions for 7 of the 34 sources have been reported previously by us but are reported here with significantly improved accuracy. These results supplement an ongoing project to increase the sky density of southern hemisphere sources in order to better define the International Celestial Reference Frame and to provide additional phase reference sources with accurate positions for use in astrophysical observations. Positions for all 34 sources are south of \u03b4=-20 &j0;(positions for nine of the sources are south of \u03b4=-60 &j0;) and have average formal uncertainties of 0.23 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2hszv8GT5-sC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15341499923058601894", "cites_id": ["15341499923058601894"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/507991/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pi-Xs-X059QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3}}
