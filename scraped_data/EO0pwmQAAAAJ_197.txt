Using X-ray and radio observations performed between 2000 and 2002, we showed that plasma ejected from XTE J1550\u2212564 has been able to travel at relativistic velocities during many years, with evidence for gradual deceleration. The broadband spectrum of the jets is consistent with synchrotron emission from high energy particles accelerated in shocks. Full details can be found in Corbel et al.
