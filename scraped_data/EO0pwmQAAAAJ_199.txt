Although HALCA cannot switch rapidly between sources, relative phase measurements between two close sources are possible if both are within the primary beam. We review VLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP) observations of such pairs, and present a preliminary analysis for the source pair 1308+ 326 and 1308+ 328. For these observations the HALCA orbit was sufficiently well determined that it was possible to make a phase-reference map of 1308+ 326 and to perform the first ever Ground-Space VLBI relative astrometry between physically unrelated sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:zBs93F57jOAC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3206513722530551145", "cites_id": ["3206513722530551145"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000aprs.conf..245P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aVXZ5j3TfywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
