We find strong evidence for a correlation between these two emission regimes that extends over more than three decades in X-ray flux, down to the quiescence level of GX 339-4. This is the strongest evidence to date for such strong coupling between radio and X-ray emission. We discuss these results in light of a jet model that can explain the radio/X-ray correlation. This could indicate that a significant fraction of the X-ray flux that is observed in the low-hard state of black hole candidates may be due to optically thin synchrotron emission from the compact jet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ZjmTu7HDCaEC", "num_citations": 518, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12039144733594547782", "cites_id": ["12039144733594547782"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2003/12/aa3264/node1.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RvZqXVmiE6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 11, "2004": 40, "2005": 33, "2006": 34, "2007": 23, "2008": 24, "2009": 19, "2010": 30, "2011": 27, "2012": 25, "2013": 30, "2014": 26, "2015": 27, "2016": 26, "2017": 11, "2018": 20, "2019": 24, "2020": 21, "2021": 21, "2022": 35, "2023": 8}}
