Flux density changes of up to 40% in as little as 45 minutes have been observed in this source, making it, along with PKS 0405-385 and J1819+ 3845, one of the three most rapid IDV sources known. We have monitored the IDV in this source with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz over the course of the last year and find a clear annual cycle in the characteristic timescale of variability. This annual cycle demonstrates unequivocally that interstellar scintillation is the cause of the rapid IDV at radio wavelengths observed in this source. We use the observed annual cycle to constrain the velocity of the scattering material and the angular size of the scintillating component of PKS 1257-326. We observe a time delay, which also shows an annual cycle, between the similar variability patterns at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:prKdS1S5QkMC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6705388415041474917", "cites_id": ["6705388415041474917"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/346180/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZRGRnzxTDl0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 9, "2004": 9, "2005": 13, "2006": 12, "2007": 19, "2008": 13, "2009": 14, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5}}
