Different light curves with temporal resolutions of minutes, 1 day and 1 month were obtained for each source. Significant variability was detected in PKS 1610-771 and Cen A. The implications of these results are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:DIP-VHrGjvwC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12281136653287763608", "cites_id": ["12281136653287763608"], "pub_url": "https://aas.aanda.org/articles/aas/ps/1997/11/ds1276.ps.gz", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mC4_ybdcb6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
