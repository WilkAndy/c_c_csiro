The source was clearly detected in all three observing epochs. We see strong evidence for a periastron flare beginning at MJD 55519.9 \u00b1 0.04 with estimated peak flux densities of up to 50 mJy and which proceeds to decline over the following 4 d. We directly resolve jet structures on sub-arcsecond scales. Flux density variability and distance from the core of nearby components suggest recent shock re-energization, though we are unable to directly connect this with the observed flare. We suggest that, if the emission is powered by an unseen outflow, then a phase delay exists between flare onset and subsequent brightening of nearby components, with flows reaching mildly relativistic velocities.
