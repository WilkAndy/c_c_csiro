We have captured the rapid rise and decline of a periastron passage flare, with flux densities for 9\u2003d prior to the event stable at \u223c1\u2003mJy at 5.5\u2003GHz and \u223c0.5\u2003mJy at 9\u2003GHz. The highest flux densities of 43.0 \u00b1 0.5\u2003mJy at 5.5\u2003GHz and 29.9 \u00b1 0.6\u2003mJy at 9\u2003GHz were measured during the flare\u2019s decline (MJD 55206.69) which continues towards pre-flare flux densities over the following 6\u2003d. Imaging of pre-flare data reveals steady structure including two stable components within 15\u2003arcsec of the core which we believe may be persistent emission regions within the system\u2019s outflows, one of which is likely associated with the system\u2019s counter jet.
