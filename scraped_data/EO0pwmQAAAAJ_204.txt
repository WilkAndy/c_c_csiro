We have analyzed the RXTE PCA data taken on Jan 24 and Feb 1st. Quick fits to both data sets with a power law+ diskbb+ smedge model were performed. On Jan 24, the photon index was 2.3. The ratio of the power law flux to the overall flux in the 3-25 keV band was 70%. The power spectrum showed weak broad band noise with 8% rms amplitude of variability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GgDznaKzj2MC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2004354942303545074", "cites_id": ["2004354942303545074"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ATel.1378....1K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8ibNUzPm0BsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
