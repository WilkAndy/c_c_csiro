Corbel, Universite Paris 7 and CEA, Saclay; R. Fender, University of Amsterdam; and A. Tzioumis, Australia Telescope National Facility, report that Australia Telescope Compact Array radio observations of XTE J1550-564, obtained on Jan. 17, confirm the reappearance of radio emission associated with the recent reactivation in x-rays (IAUC 7792), with flux densities of 2.4+/-0.1 and 2.5+/-0.1 mJy at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz, respectively. They add:\" This flat spectrum is as expected for a self-absorbed jet in the low/hard x-ray state. We see also an unexpected additional radio source, located at RA= 15h50m55s. 97, Decl.=-56o28'33\". 5 (equinox 2000.0; uncertainty< 1\"),> 20\" west of the x-ray binary, with preliminary flux densities of 4.2+/-0.1 mJy at 4.8 GHz and 2.4+/-0.1 mJy at 8.6 GHz--consistent with an optically thin synchrotron spectrum.
