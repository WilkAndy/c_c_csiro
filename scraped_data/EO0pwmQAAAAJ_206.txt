Detection sensitivities of under 1 mJy were achieved for each of the 91 fields of declinations < \u221230\u00b0 observed at 6 and 3 cm wavelength. Eight objects were detected within the inner imaged field of 1282 arc-sec2 at flux densities of \u2265 1 mJy. Preliminary work on improving the sensitivity of the survey by mapping the whole primary field of the ATCA antennas is reported."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:YfTjWGZx48AC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3549424722128863144", "cites_id": ["3549424722128863144"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083665696000608", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qP96p_oWQjEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
