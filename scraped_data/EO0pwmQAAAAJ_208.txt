The combined system operates best between 0.8 GHz and 1.74 GHz where the beamformed noise temperature is between 45 K and 60 K, the aperture efficiency ranges from 70% to 80%, and the effective field of view is 1.4 deg 2  at 1310 MHz. After a 6-month trial observing program at Parkes, the PAF will be installed on the 100 m antenna at Effelsberg. This is the first time a PAF has been installed on a large single-antenna radio telescope and made available to astronomers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:8Rip7PbZ7AYC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11181868934789942203", "cites_id": ["11181868934789942203"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7731550/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u0shV436LZsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
