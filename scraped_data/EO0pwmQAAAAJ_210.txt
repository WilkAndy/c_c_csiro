The inferred central mass is 1.3 \u00d7 106 M\u2299, while the disk mass may be on the order of 105 M\u2299, based on a nearly Keplerian rotation curve. The bipolar, wide-angle outflow appears to contain \u201cbullets\u201d ejected from within < 0.1 pc of the central mass. The positions of filaments and bullets observed in the AGN ionization cone on kpc-scales suggest that the disk channels the flow to a radius of \u223c 0.4 pc, at which the flow appears to disrupt the disk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:k_8v9Q84L5sC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11017949041508470566", "cites_id": ["11017949041508470566"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/accretion-and-outflow-traced-by-h2o-masers-in-the-circinus-agn/0B390785A1D30BBAE036A86EA208A6F3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Js93FEee55gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
