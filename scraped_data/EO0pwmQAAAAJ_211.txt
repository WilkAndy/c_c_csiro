We find that nearly all sources are resolved to some degree with the BL Lac sources being more compact than quasars. We also find that 51% of the sources have source-frame brightness temperatures in excess of 10^ 12 K."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nS6_t4fuB3kC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11935541907730111042", "cites_id": ["11935541907730111042"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000aprs.conf..183L", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QpoKvCCQo6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}}
