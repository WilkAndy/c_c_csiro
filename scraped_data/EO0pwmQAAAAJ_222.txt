The suitability of some radio sources as amplitude calibrators for the EVN is investigated. The influence of some station-dependent factors, the use of different correlators and recording systems on the results are also examined. The a-priori calibration at each network telescope has been assessed. We find that the station a-priori calibration could be greatly improved and that calibrator sources should be included in each full track VLBI observation. The suitability of some sources as calibrators, with particular emphasis on the radio source OQ208, is also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12807148939848212075", "cites_id": ["12807148939848212075"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1994A%26AS..103..365B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a14sCRsivLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
