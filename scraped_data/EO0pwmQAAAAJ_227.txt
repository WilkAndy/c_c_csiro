This project is aimed at determining what, if anything, differentiates \u03b3-ray-identified radio sources from similar strong, flat-spectrum radio sources which have not been identified as sources of greater than 100 MeV \u03b3-rays. Five VSOP observations have been successfully completed as part of this project during VSOP AO1. One observation has been correlated thus far, a 4.970 GHz observation of PKS 0637-752 from 1997 November 21. We present the VSOP image for PKS 0637-752 and make comparisons between the space VLBI image and ground-based VLBI and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) images, as well as present ATCA flux density monitoring at 4.8 GHz. A brightness temperature for PKS 0637-752 of 0.7 \u00d7 1012 K has been determined from the VSOP data and a tentative apparent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:tVg3zZbtnc0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=622389767553074412", "cites_id": ["622389767553074412"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117799011898", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7MTWLjIsowgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
