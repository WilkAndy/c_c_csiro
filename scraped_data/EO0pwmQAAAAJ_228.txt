The telescope would operate at VLBI frequencies of 5, 22, 43, and 86 GHz, as well as being capable of single-dish operation at 60 GHz. Fringe-detection thresholds will be less than 10 mJy except at 86 GHz. Key scientific goals include dual-polarization imaging of blazars on the same physical scale as their \u03b3-ray emission, astrophysical and astrometric studies of extragalactic water megamasers, and single-dish observations of O2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Hx6RvaqUy9IC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=873807071517912739", "cites_id": ["873807071517912739"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/arise-a-proposed-future-space-vlbi-mission/E49D942E4A9F25D943AE45910480B62F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o64M5OZiIAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
