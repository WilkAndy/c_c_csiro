VLBI images at frequencies of .843, 2.3, 4.8, & 8.4 were made with the southern hemisphere VLBI array and they reveal that the source is a 42 mas compact double. There is no detectable change in separation over the last 20 years, yielding an upper limit of ~ 0.03c \u00b1 0.2c on any expansion velocity. The spectral shapes of the two components are remarkably similar, despite indications of finer structure on longer baselines. Magnetic field calculations indicate fields of a few mGauss and the results are consistent with equipartition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7iKzEIWBYlQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3545497205445707126", "cites_id": ["3545497205445707126"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/multifrequency-vlbi-observations-of-the-gps-source-1934638/9BC6EE252D73D558AAA3BFB1E5EF49FD", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dkW7auwiNDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
