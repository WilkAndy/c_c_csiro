HALCA is the main element of the VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP), a complex international endeavor involving over 25 ground radio telescopes, five tracking stations and three correlators. Simultaneous observations with HALCA's 8 meter diameter radio telescope and ground radio telescopes synthesize a radio telescope over twice the size of the Earth, enabling the highest resolution 1.6 GHz and 5 GHz images to be made."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:qfTKKVVEecAC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7806678786357160785", "cites_id": ["7806678786357160785"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article-abstract/52/6/955/1540293", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UWtloP7kVmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 10, "2003": 9, "2004": 14, "2005": 12, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 0, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
