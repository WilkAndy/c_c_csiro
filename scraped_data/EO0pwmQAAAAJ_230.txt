The evolution can be divided into two phases: the initial radio outburst which lasted a few weeks, and the period from mid-1990 to the present, during which the radio emission has steadily increased. Both phases can be explained by a small fraction (0.1-0.5%) of the post-shock thermal energy being converted to energy in relativistic particles and magnetic fields, which give rise to synchrotron radiation. The optical depths, densities and density profiles for the pre-shocked circumstellar material are somewhat different for the two phases, but consistent with models of the density structure of the material within the circumstellar ring. New high-resolution radio observations show that the SN shock front is already at about three-quarters of the radius of the circumstellar ring, and that there exists a bright equatorial component of emission aligned with this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QC_fukgq8lwC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11607888345262042216", "cites_id": ["11607888345262042216"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/radio-emission-from-sn-1987a/F70A86B973F1693A04B59DD005B44421", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aKy94_KAF6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
