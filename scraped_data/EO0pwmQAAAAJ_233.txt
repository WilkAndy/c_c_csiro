No radio emission is detected at the location of GX 339-4, which is consistent with the source being in the soft state. However, we notice a new radio source located very close to the core of the system, with radio flux density of 2.39 \u00c2\u00b10.06 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 2.02 \u00c2\u00b10.06 mJy at 9 GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QuPaituDtm8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15937036677332142597", "cites_id": ["15937036677332142597"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ATel.2745....1C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BQrBhGu6K90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
