Since 2004 all experiments have been recorded using standard computer hard-disks, replacing the aging tape based S2 system. The recorder developed for this, the LBADR, comprises largely of commercial off-the-shelf components and is closeley related to the PC-EVN system"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:0wD49__q8KEC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1658278972689550072", "cites_id": ["1658278972689550072"], "pub_url": "https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/13749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-AqpkfBjAxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2}}
