The 214 sources were selected from the HALCA continuum survey list, containing 230 sources with declinations north of-30 degrees (Fomalont et al., these proceedings). Every 1-22 GHz spectrum was measured with the RATAN-600 radio telescope at six wavelengths of 1.4, 2.7, 3.9, 7.7, 13, and 31cm, over a period of a few minutes (ten minutes or more near the pole). Almost all sources are suggested to have continuous jets at milliarcsecond scales. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of the 214 individual spectra, their mean normalized statistical shape in the local frame, and the long-term variable spectra of 23 objects. Model and statistical analysis suggest the common physical origin of various radio sources in the studied sample."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:UwtWXOmdGqQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4792391852927840227", "cites_id": ["4792391852927840227"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000aprs.conf..193K", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4289wv_-gUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
