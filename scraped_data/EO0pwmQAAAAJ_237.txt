Preliminary results on the variability analysis for the sources in the sample and on the spectral index variations during the total flux density variations are given. The most interesting objects in the sample are commented on."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=321263178560462403,14249641599948141801", "cites_id": ["321263178560462403", "14249641599948141801"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999MmSAI..70..213V", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q16CpShbdQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
