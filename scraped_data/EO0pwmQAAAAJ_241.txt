The link-up was the culmination of two years of intensive effort and co-operation to co-ordinate telescope modifications and overcome the logistic problems of undertaking such an experiment. The five telescopes are sited at the NASA Deep Space tracking facility at Tidbinbilla near Canberra, the CSIRO Radio Astronomy Observatory at Parkes, the University of Tasmania's Radio Observatory near Hobart, the University of Sydney's Fleurs Observatory near Sydney, and the LANDSAT tracking station at Alice Springs. The simultaneous but independent operation of two or more widely separated telescopes is called Long-Baseline Interferometry. This experiment was set up to provide high-resolution radio maps of distant Southern Hemisphere quasars and galaxies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:N3pez2oqSB0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1045734041725347717", "cites_id": ["1045734041725347717"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00050326.1983.10435010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:haeSBpIxgw4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 3, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1}}
