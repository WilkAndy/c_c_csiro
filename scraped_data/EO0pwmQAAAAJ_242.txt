In this paper, we present the first quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray detection in quiescence of the BH LMXB MAXI J1348\u2013630, which is known to display a hybrid disc/jet connection that depends on the accretion rate. We performed deep X-ray and radio observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. MAXI J1348\u2013630 is detected for the first time in quiescence at an X-ray luminosity LX = (7.5 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 1030(D/2.2\u2009kpc)2 erg s\u22121: one of the lowest X-ray luminosities observed for a quiescent BH LMXB, possibly implying a short orbital period for the system. MAXI J1348\u2013630 is also detected in radio at LR = (4.3 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 1026(D/2.2\u2009kpc)2 erg s\u22121. These detections allow us to constrain the location of MAXI J1348\u2013630 on the radio/X-ray \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nOZr35tmOW8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13029762419123923013", "cites_id": ["13029762419123923013"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/517/1/L21/6695111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Raids-ID07QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
