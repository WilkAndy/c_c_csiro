As part of the MAVERIC survey, we have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to carry out a deep (median central noise level \u22484\u2009Jy beam-1) radio continuum survey of 26 southern globular clusters at central frequencies of 5.5 and 9.0 GHz. This paper presents a catalogue of 1285 radio continuum sources in the fields of these 26 clusters. Considering the surface density of background sources, we find significant evidence for a population of radio sources in seven of the 26 clusters, and also identify at least 11 previously known compact objects (six pulsars and five X-ray binaries). While the overall density of radio continuum sources with 7.25-GHz flux densities \u2273 20\u2009Jy in typical globular clusters is relatively low, the survey has already led to the discovery of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QB0F--xbfh4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3786181391402610615", "cites_id": ["3786181391402610615"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/3/3818/6568559", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ty-_Weo3izQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
