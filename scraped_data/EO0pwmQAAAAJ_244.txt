This conference was the logical follow-up of the first one, organized as an on-line workshop with the same title on 5-9 October 2020. Both conferences were co-organized by UNOOSA, IAU and the Government of Spain and were well attended. The focus of the second conference was about the feasibility of implementing the recommendations presented by the first on in its extensive report. The main qualifying difference between the first and second conferences was a more explicit involvement of the industrial stakeholders and of space policy experts, whose contributions were instrumental in presenting a credible review of the proposed mitigating measures as well as of possible regulatory guidelines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:hmHAmvAdi5MC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13355779361957946537", "cites_id": ["13355779361957946537"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021dqs2.rept.....W/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qST_V5FCWbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
