Ka-band VLBI astrometry from NASA's Deep Space Network has already developed a catalog of  470 observable sources with highly accurate positions. Now, several antennas worldwide are planning or are considering adding Ka-band VLBI capability. Thus, there is now an opportunity to create a worldwide Ka-band network with potential for high resolution imaging and astrometry. With baselines approaching a Giga-lambda, a Ka-band network would be able to probe source structure at the nano-radian (200  as) level ( 100X better than Hubble) and thus gain insight into the astrophysics of the most compact regions of emission  in active galactic nuclei. We discuss the advantages of Ka-band, show the known sources and  candidates, simulate projected baseline (uv) coverage, and discuss potential radio frequency feeds. The combination of these elements demonstrates the feasibility of a worldwide Ka network within the next few years!"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9582156265852003032", "cites_id": ["9582156265852003032"], "pub_url": "https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/42512", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2GJk-Fqo-oQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
