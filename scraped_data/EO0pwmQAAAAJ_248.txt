It has continuously been observed in the hard state (ATel# 2384,# 2455,# 2459), that is typically observed in the rising part of the outburst. Since its reactivation, we have been monitoring GX 339-4 very frequently in radio with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the new CABB back-end (mostly at 5.5 GHz and 9 GHz)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ClN-LZ0IzgkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2220675921865235512", "cites_id": ["2220675921865235512"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ATel.2525....1C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OFwKPPxs0R4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
