We report the results of the observations (at 3.5 and 6 cm) covering the period from February 4 to February 18. GX 339-4 has been detected in all radio observations and is very variable on timescale of days with flux density ranging from 1 to 25 mJy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:teyi7TG2FwAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9577403030921417742", "cites_id": ["9577403030921417742"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ATel.1007....1C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DhTSOFDF6YQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
