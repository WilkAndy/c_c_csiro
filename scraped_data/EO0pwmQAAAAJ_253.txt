The GPS and CSS sources are powerful but compact radio sources whose spectra are generally simple and convex with peaks near 1 GHz and 100 MHz respectively. The GPS sources are entirely contained within the extent of the narrow line region (< 1 kpc) while the CSS sources are contained entirely within the host galaxy (< 15 kpc).Current models for the evolution of powerful radio galaxies suggest that these sources propagate from the 10 pc to Mpc scales at roughly constant velocity through an ambient medium which declines in density while the sources decline in radio luminosity. The observed number densities of powerful radio sources as a function of linear size (from tens of parsecs to hundreds of kpc) are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:3I1Fh14WnZcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2039823988472063691", "cites_id": ["2039823988472063691"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/third-workshop-on-compact-steep-spectrum-and-ghzpeaked-spectrum-radio-sources-kerastari-tripolis-greece-2931-may-2002/21B4E29D38E4C86F5FE6C63DD8D10FC8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y6YyLRzpThwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
