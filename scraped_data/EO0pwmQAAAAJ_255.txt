The structure in themilli-arcsecond resolution observation with the VLBA at 15 GHz showsan extended emission region to the north-west and possibly alsoperpendicular emitting regions, believed to be in the orbital plane.This X-ray state is believed to be associated with an advectiveaccretion environment. These observations were spaced 2 days apart overthe 5.6-day orbital period. The images confirm the existence of persistentemission from the source from both an unresolved core and a variable, andat least moderately (>0.6c) relativistic jet, during the low/hard X-raystate. However, at this resolution and wavelength they do not show anysign of the emission in the orbital plane observed at a 5\u03c3level at 15 GHz in the initial epoch."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:_IsBomjs8bsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14312859209848625865", "cites_id": ["14312859209848625865"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1011650102989", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yZo0W559ocYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
