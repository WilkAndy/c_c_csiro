In both the radio galaxies, the HI appears to give us information about the environment in which the radio sources are embedded, the effect that the ISM can have on the observed characteristics and the possible presence of interaction between the ISM and the radio plasma."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:fJljFJTiP-AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10928278023027708455", "cites_id": ["10928278023027708455"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0010482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J1JGIfYKqZcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 1}}
