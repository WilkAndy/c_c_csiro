Kedziora-Chudczer, University of Sydney; D. Jauncey, M. Wieringa, J. Reynolds, and A. Tzioumis, Australia Telescope National Facility; and G. Nicholson, Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory, communicate:\" Five days of monitoring of PKS 0405-385 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array between June 7.16 and 11.91 UT revealed rapid, quasiperiodic, quasisinusoidal flux-density variations of large amplitude at 3, 6, 13, and 20 cm. The variations are largest and most rapid at 3 and 6 cm, with changes of up to 1 Jy (from 1.6 to 2.6 Jy at 3 cm) in< 1 hr. At 13 cm, the changes are less rapid (up to 0.4 Jy in 8 hr); at 20 cm, up to 0.2 Jy in 12 hr. Such large-amplitude flux-density variations of an extragalactic radio source is unprecedented on such short timescales. PKS 0405-385 is a quasar of mag 18 at z= 1.285 that is only weakly polarized (3-percent linear polarization at 6 GHz), and it has been identified \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2LRQiq5aZigC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6140302729572963990", "cites_id": ["6140302729572963990"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996IAUC.6418....2K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ltaOwcy8NlUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
