In 2002 May, the source moved from a low/hard to a very high X-ray state, contemporaneously exhibiting a very bright optically thin radio flare. Further observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array have tracked the formation of a collimated structure extending to about 12 arcsec, with apparent velocity greater than 0.9c. The luminosity of the outflow seems to be rapidly decreasing; these observations confirm that transient large-scale jets are likely to be common events triggered by X-ray state transitions in black hole X-ray binaries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:FP-YCU5gdjEC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11076417748616784275", "cites_id": ["11076417748616784275"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/347/3/L52/1023121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k6kiykFXt5kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 8, "2005": 13, "2006": 11, "2007": 8, "2008": 12, "2009": 14, "2010": 13, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
