The nature of the accretor in this source has not been identified. In this paper, we show results from a quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray monitoring campaign taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope (XRT), and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. We also analyse the X-ray temporal behaviour using observations from the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer. Results show a seemingly peculiar X-ray spectral evolution of MAXI J1810\u2212222 during this outburst, where the source was initially only detected in the soft X-ray band for the early part of the outburst. Then, \u223c200 d after MAXI J1810\u2212222 was first detected the hard X-ray emission increased and the source transitioned to a long-lived (\u223c1.5 yr) bright, harder X-ray state. After this hard state, MAXI \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:XZvG1uL-wj0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10374308205616283522", "cites_id": ["10374308205616283522"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/513/4/6196/6585672", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gr8t-ljy-I8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
