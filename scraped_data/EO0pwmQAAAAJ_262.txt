Swift/BAT and MAXI detected the source until 2013 January, but then the flux level dropped below their detection limits. We carried out radio observations with ATCA on 2013 March 9 and May 3 and Swift observations on March 9 and May 10."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yRL2jD08WzAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5354644231054881939", "cites_id": ["5354644231054881939"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ATel.5063....1T/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k_Se2o6ET0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
