Following its identification as a black hole candidate, we observed MAXI J1543-564 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2011 May 14 (16: 51-18: 02 UT; MJD 55695.73). We used the Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB) to observe simultaneously at central frequencies of 5.5 and 9.0 GHz, with an observing bandwidth of 2048 MHz at each frequency."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1440764851937624636", "cites_id": ["1440764851937624636"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ATel.3364....1M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PEKc1P-f_hMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2}}
