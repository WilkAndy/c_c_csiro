Joint quasi-simultaneous observations between the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and ground based observatories allow us to discriminate between competing theoretical blazar emission models. High resolution VLBI observations are the only way to spatially resolve the sub-parsec level emission regions where the high-energy radiation originates. The gap from radio to gamma-ray energies is spanned with near simultaneous data from the Swift satellite and ground based optical observatories. We present early results from the TANAMI program in the context of this panchromatic suite of observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lZkERF9nS_wC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12951759029312343093", "cites_id": ["12951759029312343093"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NcyePjfkvbMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
