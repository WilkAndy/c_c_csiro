The observations were carried out with the ATCA in the configuration of the 6 km array. We confirm the reactivation of H1743-322 as observed in X-rays by RXTE/ASM (Kalemci et al., ATEL# 1348), a radio source being detected at the location of the black hole candidate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2oMuTuaXnloC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12269316898870613641", "cites_id": ["12269316898870613641"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ATel.1349....1C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iVbhwbZeRaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
