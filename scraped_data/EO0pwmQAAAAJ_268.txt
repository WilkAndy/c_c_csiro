Observations of ISS can be used to probe structure both in the ionized insterstellar medium of the Galaxy and in the extragalactic sources themselves down to \u03bc as scales. A few quasars have been found to show large amplitude scintillations on unusually rapid, intrahour timescales. This has been shown to be due to weak scattering in very local Galactic \u2018screens\u2019, within a few tens of parsec of the Sun. The short variability timescales allow detailed study of the scintillation properties in relatively short observation periods with compact interferometric arrays. The three best-studied \u2018intrahour variable\u2019 quasars, PKS 0405\u2212385, J1819+3845 and PKS 1257\u2212326, have been instrumental in establishing ISS as the principal cause of intraday \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yyP9NS4UN-AC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14532358532749883359", "cites_id": ["14532358532749883359"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10556790701596804", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:33cs_RZPrckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
