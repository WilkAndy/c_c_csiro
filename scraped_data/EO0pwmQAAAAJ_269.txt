Following a prompt radio outburst, no radio flux was detectable from SN1987A until 1990. Since then, there has been a gradual increase in the flux density at all frequencies (the 1.4 GHz flux density at the beginning of 2007 was 0.32 Jy) and a gradual flattening of its spectral index to the current value of \u03b1 = \u22120.75 (S \u221d v\u03b1). The remnant is now bright enough to detect, via HI absorption, components of the foreground interstellar medium not seen since ultraviolet observations shortly after the explosion. Nevertheless, SN1987A remains spectacularly underluminous in the radio compared with more distant radio supernovae detected by existing radio telescopes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:q736b1r0g6UC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18241559989184627356", "cites_id": ["18241559989184627356"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3682888", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nAJUiCkKJ_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
