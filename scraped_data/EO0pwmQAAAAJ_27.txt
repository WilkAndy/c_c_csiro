At 1.4, 2.4, 4.8, and 8.6 GHz, the flux density of the radio remnant has increased monotonically since emission was redetected 1200 days after the explosion. On day 3200, the remnant was expanding at 2800\u00b1400 km s-1, which we interpret as indicating significant deceleration of the fastest moving ejecta. Since day 1787, the spectral index has remained constant at \u03b1=-0.95\u00b10.04 (S\u221d \u03bd \u03b1). These observations are all consistent with the shock having encountered a denser shocked component of the progenitor's stellar wind. At the current rate of expansion, the shock is expected to encounter the inner optical ring in the year 2006\u00b13, in line with predictions made by hydrodynamic simulations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:NAkivslCrNUC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16684746785612572723", "cites_id": ["16684746785612572723"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/303917/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MyjHS80gjOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 10, "1999": 6, "2000": 12, "2001": 12, "2002": 16, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
