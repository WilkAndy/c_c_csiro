ATEL# 441). Observations taken at 4.86 GHz with the Very Large Array (VLA) showed a 1.77+/-0.07 mJy source on March 16th (13: 38 to 14: 29 UT), and a 3.6+/-0.1 mJy source on March 18th (12: 59 to 13: 10 UT). The latter represents the strongest radio emission so far during the current outburst."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TKVID9p7UpsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10249954476182892127", "cites_id": ["10249954476182892127"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ATel..443....1R/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X27OHEonP44J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
