It has been demonstrated that interstellar scintillation (ISS) is the principal cause of such rapid variability. Observations of ISS can be used to probe very compact, microarcsecond-scale structure in quasar inner jets, as well as properties of turbulence in the local Galactic ISM. A few sources show unusually rapid, intra-hour variations, evidently due to scattering in very nearby, localized turbulence. We present recent findings for the rapidly scintillating quasar PKS 1257-326. The large-scale MASIV VLA Survey showed that such sources are extremely rare, implying that for most scintillating sources, longer-term, dedicated monitoring programs are required to extract detailed information on source structures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:adgdM4TzidAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17878419854318868812", "cites_id": ["17878419854318868812"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412650", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TJn3MSLoHPgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
