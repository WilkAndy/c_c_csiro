We review recent observations of X-ray jets from Galactic black hole candidates. Spatially resolved X-ray spectra from SS 433 have provided evidence for re-heating in a hadronic jet and may offer an observational probe of jet collimation. A large-scale jet from the now quiescent transient 4U 1755\u201333 appears to indicate continual jet formation over a period of 10\u201330 years. Detection of a jet from XTE J1550\u2013564 has provided the first direct measurement of gradual deceleration of a jet from a black hole and strong evidence for the re-energization of jet particles to energies up to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:jMMVlDWEh88C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11429579907441547735", "cites_id": ["11429579907441547735"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920563204001203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:19n-il4Gnp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
