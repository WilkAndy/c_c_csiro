This is in qualitative agreement with models of an expanding, synchrotron-emitting cloud, as proposed by van der Laan (1966) for outbursts of active galactic nuclei. Furthermore, in recent years the time evolution of several outbursts have been imaged at high angular resolution with arrays such as VLA, MERLIN and VLBA, and these images reveal the outflow of radio-emitting matter along more or less collimated paths at relativistic velocities. More recently relatively stable radio emission from at least one persistent X-ray binary has also been resolved into a jet-like structure. As a result it has become widely, if not universally, accepted that radio emission from X-ray binaries arises in synchrotron-emitting jets.
