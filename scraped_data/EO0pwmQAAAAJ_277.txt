Twenty-five percent of the scientific time of this mission is devoted to a survey of the 400 brightest, small-diameter extra-galactic radio sources at 5GHz. The major goals of the VSOP survey are statistical in nature: to determine the brightness temperature and approximate structure; to provide a source list for use with future VLBI space missions; and to compare radio properties with other data throughout the EM spectrum. This paper describes: The compilation of the entire source list; the selection of sources to be observed with VSOP; the extensive ground resources; and the status of the observations as of March 2000. In these proceedings Paper II describes the reduction methods and Paper III gives initial statistical results."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:qStMeLs7OP8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8876361233747563233", "cites_id": ["8876361233747563233"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000aprs.conf..167F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4VKSW4MrL3sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
