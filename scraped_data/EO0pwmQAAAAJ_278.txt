Of crucial importance in the production of VSOP images is the choice of weighting schemes. The paper examines some of the issues involved in choosing an appropriate weighting scheme and shows that a couple of schemes in common use by VLBI astronomers are inadequate for making VSOP images. When the appropriate weighting scheme is chosen, VSOP images of moderate dynamic range (\u2248 1000:1) can be produced."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:tntj4plCNvAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3565674594699274453", "cites_id": ["3565674594699274453"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117799011771", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1Wiv8SbSezEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
