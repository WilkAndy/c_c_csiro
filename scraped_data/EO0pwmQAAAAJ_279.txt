These commercial antennas of 27.5 and 15 m diameter provide a very economical improvement to the imaging capability of this array and the practice of using such antennas can be extended to other sites in the Southern Hemisphere in preparation for the forthcoming space\u2010VLBI experiments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nk1qRvIppk4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11797757716160488403", "cites_id": ["11797757716160488403"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1145634", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:06PeuSIOuqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
