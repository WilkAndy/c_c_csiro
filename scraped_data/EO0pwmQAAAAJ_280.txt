These low resolution (FWHM \n4~ 1OA) spectra include the NH feature at 3360A and the CH feature at 4300A. We have \nemployed spectrum synthesis techniques to deduce th~ values of [Fe/H], [N/Fe] arid [C/Fe] for \nthese unevolved stars. For the great majority of stars in the sample, the r~su1ts are compatible \nwith a secondary origin of N.
