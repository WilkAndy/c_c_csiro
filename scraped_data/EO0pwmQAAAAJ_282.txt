These pulses can originate from pulsars, RRATS and other classes of known or unknown objects. To detect these pulses a detection algorithm is being run on an incoherent beam from the different LOFAR stations. This incoherent beam has a wide field of view and can be formed parallel to other observations, such that both can run at the same time. A precise localisation is done by storing the data from each dipole. This gives an all\u2010sky coverage with a spatial resolution of order arc seconds. The source is identified by making high time\u2010resolution images. This is explained in more detail with preliminary results illustrating the methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:5rMqqAh47xYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10399905506577700404", "cites_id": ["10399905506577700404"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3615150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NFYxCfXiU5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2}}
