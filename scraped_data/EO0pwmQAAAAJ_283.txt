This is comparable to the angular resolution obtainedwith the Hubble Space Telescope and is approximately 3 times higher than has been possiblewith the Australia Telescope Compact Array or 5 times higher than with the Chandra X-rayObservatory. The e-VLBI data at 1.4 GHz show good agreement with the ATCA data at 9GHz, resolving the substructure in the equatorial brightness enhancements of the remnant(allowing for the fact that the e-VLBI observations are sensitive to structure on angular scales<0.4?). We place a 3s upper limit on the time-averaged pulsar emission or a compact pulsarpowerednebula at this frequency of 1 mJy/beam. These observations were made usingtelescopes in Australia, with the data transferred in real-time to the European VLBI Networkcorrelator at the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe, in The Netherlands, via high-speednetworks, as part of the EXPReS project, demonstrating the feasibility of a real-time global e-VLBI network at 512 Mbps per antenna."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7GbmjkRdlf4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6436971380969677871", "cites_id": ["6436971380969677871"], "pub_url": "https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/46363", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L6QN0F23VFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
