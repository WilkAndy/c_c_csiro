These similarities include the radiative efficiency and jet power as a function of accretion rate, which are themselves probably the origin of the `fundamental plane of black hole activity'. A second `fundamental plane' which connects mass, accretion rate and timing properties provides us with a further physical diagnostic. Patterns of radio loudness (i.e. jet production) as a function of luminosity and accretion state are shown to be similar for X-ray binaries and AGN. Finally we discuss how neutron stars are a useful control sample, and what the future may hold for this field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:08Fspu5RUkwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13706081563254796192", "cites_id": ["13706081563254796192"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3838", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oC9VWJDINb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2}}
