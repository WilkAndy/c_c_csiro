These observations are aimed specifically toward improvement of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) in the Southern Hemisphere. We present the contributions of this program to the densification of the ICRF in the Southern Hemisphere and the imaging of all southern hemisphere ICRF sources for calculation of a \u201cstructure index\u201d. The impact of both these contributions to the improvement of the ICRF in the Southern Hemisphere will be discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:jOyC0gq838wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5726897316499365778", "cites_id": ["5726897316499365778"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-49350-1_89", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kh8VV8QGek8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
