Weak radio emission was detected on 21 Sept 2005, for the first time since May 2005. The flux was continuing to rise on 22 Sept. The data recorded are as follows: 20 Sept, MJD 53633.916 (VLA)< 0.62 mJy (4860 MHz) 21 Sept, MJD 53634 (ATCA) 0.31+/-0.08 mJy (4800 MHz) 0.36+/-0.08 mJy (8640 MHz) 22 Sept, MJD 53635.931 (VLA) 0.66+/-0.09 mJy (4860 MHz) The ATCA data show a flat spectrum, consistent with the compact jet that is typically associated with the low/hard state."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:DzJ_J07hbkYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10438419819678660271", "cites_id": ["10438419819678660271"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ATel..612....1B/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r_ZXWIW33JAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
