Both remnants have an edge-brightened, ring-like morphology though, in the case of SN1987A, the expansion rate is currently only around 3500 km s\u22121. The flux density of the remnant of SN1987A continues to rise at all measured radio frequencies. Its spectral index is gradually flattening, indicating its transition into the supernova remnant phase. A campaign to increase the resolution of radio imaging by observing at higher frequencies is underway with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:sRzLl6AghiAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15764631731374932970", "cites_id": ["15764631731374932970"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/sn-1987a-at-radio-wavelengths/026CED56EFAE232B5ED3438BF634053F", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6kN0-wg5x9oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2}}
