Current evidence supports interstellar scintillation (ISS) as the mechanism causing IDV at cm wavelengths. While the Survey is still underway, the first results show at least 15% of the sources exhibit IDV, and hence possess microarcsecond scale structure. There is also a strong flux density dependence on the fraction of IDV sources, and some indication that EGRET sources are more likely to exhibit IDV than non-EGRET sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:wxMeWMEqLDMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2398784439217245674", "cites_id": ["2398784439217245674"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2003ASPC..290..347L", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6k1H-LwxSiEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2}}
