The source was not detected in the X-ray band during a 4.3 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation made on August 5.2 UT. Assuming a power-law energy spectrum with a photon index of 2 and interstellar absorption with a column density of N_H= 2e21 cm^-2 gives a 3-sigma upper limit on the absorbed 0.5-7 keV flux of 1.3 e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 and a corresponding luminosity upper limit of 1.0 e32 (d/7 kpc)^ 2 erg s^-1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:cdM53WF7QocC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16763354446383859666", "cites_id": ["16763354446383859666"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ATel..105....1T/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0sesjA1mo-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1}}
