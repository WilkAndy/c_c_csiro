We compute these statistics, and compare results with computer simulations and with observations. We consider cross-correlation of two signals (or auto-correlation of one); we suppose that each signal is complex, and consists of spectrally-varying Gaussian noise. Variance and covariance as a function of frequency thus completely characterize the signals. We suppose that these signals are then quantized, and correlated. For many samples, the correlation is drawn from a Gaussian distribution at each frequency, and is completely characterized by its average and variance. The average correlation is proportional to that of the unquantized signals (or is related linearly, for an autocorrelation). The variance of the correlation depends on the spectra of the signals and on the quantizer levels. Specifically, it is a product of linear functions of the normalized autocorrelation spectra of the two signals. We present expressions for the variance, and compare results with computer simulations and with VLBI observations of the Vela pulsar. We find excellent agreement."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:A36e8EsbUSoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4189449016934414607", "cites_id": ["4189449016934414607"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=788f947a9e6badfd0956d7097648492c1c22c16f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Dzn8Kq_pIzoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1}}
