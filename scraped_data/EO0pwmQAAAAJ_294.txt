Flux densities were measured with an accuracy of 0.5/%, and all sources that showed variations of 2/% or greater over intervals of up to 2 days were noted. We find that the fraction of sources that show intra-day variations is roughly constant at 6/% of the sample at each of the survey frequencies, 2.4, 4.8 and 8.6 GHz. We show the sky distribution of the IDV sources and discuss the Survey results in terms of interstellar scattering as the cause of the variations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:H1wcazwC3NUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6671724428262107883", "cites_id": ["6671724428262107883"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AAS...192.5703K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6-rb6QS6llwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1}}
