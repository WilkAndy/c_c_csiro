Quasiperiodic oscillations in the range 20\u201340 min have been found and are probably related to oscillations in the soft X-ray flux."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:L7vk9XBBNxgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9733222837073961624", "cites_id": ["9733222837073961624"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/grs-1915105-flares-qpos-and-other-events-at-15-ghz/208988D0983FFECD8693227DA940225D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mGKD-5laE4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
