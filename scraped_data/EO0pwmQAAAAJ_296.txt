Since then, several observations have been obtained with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in order to study the radio behavior of this source in relation to its soft and hard X-ray activity. We present new results of high resolution radio observations performed with the ATCA in order to study the jet-like feature observed in GX 339\u22124 by Fender et al. [3]. From the ATCA lightcurve at 8640 MHz, we find evidence of quenched radio emission from GX 339\u22124."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TXeVt8n0jncC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8039382122800474658", "cites_id": ["8039382122800474658"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.54163", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IuolO3KfkW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2}}
