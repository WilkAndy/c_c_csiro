In the Low-Hard X-ray state the system displays a strong 3-way linear correlation between soft- and hard-X-rays and radio emission, implying a coupling between the Comptonising corona and a radio-emitting compact jet. In this state the radio emission is linearly polarised at a level of around 2 %, with an almost constant polarisation angle, indicative of a favored axis in this system probably related to the compact jet and/or black hole spin axis. In the Off X-ray state the radio emission declines with the X-ray emission to below detectable levels, suggesting that it is simply a lower-luminosity version of the Low-Hard state. In the High-Soft state both the hard-X-ray and radio emission are suppressed. We also note that the transitions from the Low-Hard state to the High-Soft state (and the reverse) are possibly associated with discrete ejection(s) of expanding relativistic plasma."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:IxBLoz_EsGYC", "num_citations": 464, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=315012134326387906", "cites_id": ["315012134326387906"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003460", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wkR2_t0lXwQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 18, "2002": 26, "2003": 27, "2004": 21, "2005": 20, "2006": 33, "2007": 22, "2008": 29, "2009": 13, "2010": 20, "2011": 15, "2012": 19, "2013": 24, "2014": 17, "2015": 19, "2016": 18, "2017": 15, "2018": 15, "2019": 14, "2020": 18, "2021": 22, "2022": 28, "2023": 5}}
