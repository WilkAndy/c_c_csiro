This transition was evident both in timing and spectral properties. Combining the data from the Proportional Counter Array (PCA), the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE) and the Imager on Board the INTEGRAL Satellite (IBIS), we obtained good quality broad-band (3\u2013200 keV) energy spectra before and after the transition. These spectra indicate that the hard component steepened. Also, the high-energy cut-off that was present at \u223c70 keV before the transition was not detected after the transition. This is the first time that an accurate determination of the broad-band spectrum across such a transition has been measured on a short time-scale. It shows that, although some spectral parameters do not change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Yw6v6SrDvuUC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5422696196255861696", "cites_id": ["5422696196255861696"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/367/3/1113/1040417", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wEuxtnVJQUsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 9, "2007": 13, "2008": 15, "2009": 12, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 10, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 9}}
