Detections were made of the radio-loud quasar PKS B0727\u2013115, which shows superluminal motion, and the intra-day variable quasar PKS B0524+ 034. The latter source was used as a phase reference calibrator for observations at the position of the gamma-ray burst GRB 080409, for which an upper limit to the radio emission is set. Australia Telescope Compact Array data were also used to derive a limit on the radio flux density of the GRB afterglow. These observations demonstrate the capability to form a large Australasian radio telescope network for e-VLBI, with data transported and processed in realtime over high capacity networks. This campaign represents the first step towards more regular e-VLBI observations in this region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:sJRvXmEhuqoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12558245577253008355", "cites_id": ["12558245577253008355"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/16/11/164/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4zNJ6tDZR64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
