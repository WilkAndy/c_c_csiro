We describe RadioAstron observations directed to understand interstellar scattering by studies of pulsars. The RadioAstron project is an international collaborative mission involving a free-flying satellite, Spektr-R, carrying a 10-m space radio telescope on an elliptical orbit around the Earth. This space telescope performs radio astronomical observations, using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) techniques in conjunction with ground-based VLBI networks. The orbit of Spektr-R evolves with time. It has an apogee between 280,000 and 350,000 km, a perigee between 7,000 and 80,000 km, a period of 8 to 9 days, and an initial inclination of 51\u00b0. RadioAstron operates at the standard radio astronomical wavelengths of 1.19 to 1.63 cm (K-band), 6.2 cm (C-band), 18 cm (L-band), and 92 cm (P-band). As compact radio emitters, pulsars display a variety of observables useful for inferring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:_sH1KHQ1xKcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8818261976484088652", "cites_id": ["8818261976484088652"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6928129/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
