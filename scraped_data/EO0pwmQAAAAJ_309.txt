We present a new radio image at 44 GHz of the supernova remnant (SNR), derived from observations performed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in 2011. The diffraction-limited image has a resolution of 349\u00d7225 mas, which is the highest achieved to date in high-dynamic range images of the SNR. We also present a new image at 18 GHz, also derived from ATCA observations performed in 2011, which is super-resolved to 0\u2033.25. The new 44 and 18 GHz images yield the first high-resolution spectral index map of the remnant. The comparison of the 44 GHz image with contemporaneous X-ray and H\u03b1 observations allows further investigations of the nature of the remnant asymmetry and sheds more light into the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3918648047118593297", "cites_id": ["3918648047118593297"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/radio-remnant-of-supernova-1987a-at-high-frequencies-and-high-resolution/ED3F68602E8E780251A1D31B582E0597", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ES1IEKPVYTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
