This is one of the first detections of a VLBI counterjet and provides new constraints on the kinematics of the radio jets emerging from the nucleus of Cen A. A bright, compact core is seen at 8.4 GHz, along with a jet extending along PA 51. The core is completely absorbed at 2.3 GHz. Our images show a much wider gap between the base of the main jet and the counterjet at 2.3 GHz than at 8.4 GHz and also that the core has an extraordinarily inverted spectrum. These observations provide evidence that the innermost 0.4\u20130.8 pc of the source is seen through a disk or torus of ionized gas which is opaque at low frequencies due to free-free absorption."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:pGq6TLPqxssC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17807543266392370297", "cites_id": ["17807543266392370297"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/310183/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eWy3m0AaIfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 11, "1998": 12, "1999": 11, "2000": 8, "2001": 9, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 11, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
