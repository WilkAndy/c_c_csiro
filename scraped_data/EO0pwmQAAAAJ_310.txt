This paper reports on measures being taken in Australia to protect the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory, which is a candidate site for the Square Kilometre Array. Public standards for interference levels have been established, based on internationally approved ITU-R standards. Potential interference from industry will be managed by the ACMA and State Government measures, within the framework of a principle of co-existence. Technical advisory guidelines will describe the acceptable limits on the use of typical radio systems and electrical equipment. Interference from activities on the site, such as power generation, computing, and support \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:wRp7bqO99tsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15228754417214222563", "cites_id": ["15228754417214222563"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6051294/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4_C2AXVnV9MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
