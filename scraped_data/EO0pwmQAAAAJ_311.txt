We did not detect the source at its well established coordinates in any of the individual observations, nor by combining all three data-sets. The first observation started 2011 April 17.49 (UT) for 1.41 hours on source, giving 3-sigma upper limits of 72 microJy at 5.5 GHz and 103 microJy at 9 GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QV3w6uztVfcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8511500786132697831", "cites_id": ["8511500786132697831"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ATel.3310....1C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:58Llft7sHnYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
