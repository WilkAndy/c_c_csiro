Given its high compactness (Doi et al. 2006, PASJ 58, 829), inverted spectrum, and 0deg declination, the source was an ideal target to observe at 22 GHz with a Global VLBI array extending from Europe to East Asia and Australia. In order to deliver prompt results to be analysed in combination with the other instruments participating in the campaign, the observations were carried out with real time VLBI, for the first time on a Global scale. Indeed, the main results have been published just a few months after the campaign (Abdo et al. 2009, ApJ 707, 727). Here we present additional details about the e-VLBI observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2026079916445918382", "cites_id": ["2026079916445918382"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ruRPCvMUHhwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
