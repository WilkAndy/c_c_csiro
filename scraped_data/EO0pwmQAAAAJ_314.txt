No radio pulsations (ATEL# 1129) and no continuum radio emission (ATEL# 1128) were detected then. While the radio pulsation search was performed during the outburst, the continuum observations were carried out when the X-ray flux levels already decreased below the detection limit of Swift."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10126832533815360010", "cites_id": ["10126832533815360010"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ATel.2138....1T/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CvruBYm8iYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
