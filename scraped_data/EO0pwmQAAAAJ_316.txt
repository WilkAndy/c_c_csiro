We find an upper limit on its radio flux of about 300 \u03bcJy and a detection of it in the X-rays with a luminosity of about 3 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121, a value much lower than what had been observed in some of the low angular resolution surveys of the past. These data are in good agreement with the idea that the X-ray emission from V Puppis comes from mass transfer between the two B stars in the system, but can still accommodate the idea that the X-ray emission comes from the black hole accreting stellar wind from one or both of the B stars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=974544171845291971", "cites_id": ["974544171845291971"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/393/3/1070/968775", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ww_EzMJGhg0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
