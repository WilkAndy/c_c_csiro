Although radio astronomy has been allocated some radio bands by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), cosmic radio emissions occur over the whole of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, there is a need for radio telescopes to operate over very wide radio bands and avoid RFI. Radio Quiet Zones (RQZ) in various forms have been implemented around many radio astronomy observatories, to minimise the impact of RFI on radio astronomy observations by coordinating with nearby radiocommunication services. The history and characteristics of such RQZ around the world will be reviewed, with emphasis on recent experience. For the next generation radio astronomy telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), it will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14327876699809510094", "cites_id": ["14327876699809510094"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008cosp...37.3247T/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zvK9NfLX1sYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
