This makes up the Deep X-ray Radio Blazar Survey (DXRBS). Here we present new identifications and spectra for 106 sources, including 86 radio-loud quasars, 11 BL Lacertae objects, and nine narrow-line radio galaxies. Together with our previously published objects and already-known sources, our sample now contains 298 identified objects: 234 radio-loud quasars [181 flat-spectrum quasars: FSRQ (\u03b1r\u22640.50) and 53 steep-spectrum quasars: SSRQ], 36 BL Lacs and 28 narrow-line radio galaxies. Redshift information is available for 96 per cent of these. Thus our selection technique is \u223c90 per cent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16823218173404032352", "cites_id": ["16823218173404032352"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/323/3/757/1156085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YK2kpMsTeOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 7, "2003": 10, "2004": 15, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 10, "2008": 14, "2009": 12, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
