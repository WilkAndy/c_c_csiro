We did not detect a radio counterpart down to an rms noise level of 0.05 mJy/beam at 4.8 GHz. In terms of luminosity, the inferred 3-sigma upper limit to the possible radio counterpart of LMC X-3 (< 0.15 mJy at 55 kpc) is at least 5 times weaker than the Galactic black hole GRS 1915+ 105 while in the plateau state (20 mJy at 11 kpc), but still 7 times higher than Cygnus X-1 while in the hard state (15 mJy at 2 kpc)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:HaiYZdWvYCYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10247276418900696892", "cites_id": ["10247276418900696892"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ATel.1138....1G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PB_QT5yjNY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
