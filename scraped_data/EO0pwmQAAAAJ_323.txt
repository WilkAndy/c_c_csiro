We show that apparent correlations on short time scales in the lightcurves of Cyg X-l are probably the coincidental outcome of white noise statistics.As a measure of correlation between radio and X-ray emission, we calculate the maximum cross-correlation coefficient, ccf, of simultaneous radio and X-ray lightcurves, which are rebinned to a resolution of 32 s and smoothed. Every single X-ray lightcurve segment is cross-correlated with the corresponding radio lightcurve, up to a maximum shift \u0394t = \u00b110 h."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GHsHDPAyICYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1984521695635650392", "cites_id": ["1984521695635650392"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/shortterm-radioxray-correlations-of-cygnus-x1/5EBDA969942DE58F5C8B1975D1CC3A1B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WDdrvfdvihsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1}}
