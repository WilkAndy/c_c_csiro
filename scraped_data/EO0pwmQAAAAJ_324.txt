Observations were obtained approximately every two months, at wavelengths of 21, 12, 6 and 3 cm simultaneously. Variability in both total flux density and linear polarization was observed in all sources, on a variety of timescales, due to both source-intrinsic effects and interstellar scintillation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4DUywrCQPfoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2422119053955362354", "cites_id": ["2422119053955362354"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920563204000775", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mu62VnIYnSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
