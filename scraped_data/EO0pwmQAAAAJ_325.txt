We present the analysis of simultaneous radio (VLA) and X-ray (RXTE) observations of three atoll sources: 4U 1728\u201334, 4U 1820\u201330 and Ser X-1 (first radio detection). In 4U 1728\u201334 we find a significant correlation between radio and X-ray flux and, for the first time in an X-ray binary, a significant quantitative correlation between radio flux and X-ray timing features. As in BHCs it seems that also in atolls (i.e. in 4U 1820-30, Ser X-1 and in one observation of 4U 1728-34) the radio emission is 'quenched' above a certain luminosity, when the sources are in a softer state."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:o-PowTg_VKEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8573714304107688376", "cites_id": ["8573714304107688376"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920563204001677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uDEG7rvz-3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
