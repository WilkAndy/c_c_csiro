Models predict that the high/soft state corresponds to a high mass transfer phase in the binary, and since the X-ray source is fueled by accretion from the stellar wind of the supergiant companion, the simple expectation is that the high/soft state results from an increased wind mass loss rate. Alternatively, a decrease in the wind mass loss rate could result in a more ionized and slower wind in the vicinity of the black hole, which would then be more easily accreted by the black hole. The best test of these hypotheses is to observe the UV P Cygni lines of the supergiant that are formed in its wind outflow. We recently used HST/STIS to obtain the first high resolution UV spectra of the system while it resided in the unusual high soft states in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:feST4K8J0scC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2510672841186439052", "cites_id": ["2510672841186439052"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AAS...203.8106G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jG8jnqWz1yIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
