Key to this realisation has been the discovery of three quasars which show unusually rapid intra-hour scintillation as a result of localized scattering in the turbulent Galactic interstellar medium. PKS 1257-326 is one such rapid scintillator discovered serendipitously at the ATCA. We have observed time delays on separate occasions between the variability pattern arrival times at the VLA and the ATCA as well as an annual cycle in the timescale of the pattern of variability. Additionally long-term intrinsic changes in the source are evident. Here we present the results we have obtained from two years of observations and discuss implications for the microarcsecond-scale source structure and the scattering process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:0PPYGq5nos8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17639645253217523745", "cites_id": ["17639645253217523745"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003IAUJD..18E..12B/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IZjvIeabzPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
