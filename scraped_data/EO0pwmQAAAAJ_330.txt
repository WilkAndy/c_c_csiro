Plasma ejected from near the black hole traveled at relativistic velocities for at least four years. We present direct evidence for gradual deceleration in a relativistic jet. The broadband spectrum of the jets is consistent with synchrotron emission from high energy (up to 10 TeV) particles accelerated in shock waves formed within the relativistic ejecta or by the interaction of the jets with the interstellar medium. XTE J1550-654 offers a unique opportunity to study the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets on time scales inaccessible for active galactic nuclei jets, with implications for our understanding of relativistic jets from Galactic x-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:F4gwyMVh_r0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17156074161519018502", "cites_id": ["17156074161519018502"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210224", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BkKZmY2eFu4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
