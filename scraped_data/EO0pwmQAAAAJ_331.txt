This is recalled in the first paragraph of the Mountain Forest Protocoll of the Alpine Convention:'mountain forests provide the most effective, the least expensivee and the most aesthetic protection against natural hazards.'In Austria and Switzerlandd alone, approximately 50 million Euros are spent yearly to maintain or improve thee protection provided by mountain forests (European Observatory of Mountain Forests, 2000;; Swiss Federal Statistical Office, 2002). Increasingly, protection needs to be combined withh other functions and uses of mountain forests.'Nowadays foresters do not only deal with rockfalll and snow avalanche control, they also have to deal with timber production, ungulate browsing,, nature conservation and recreation. However, preventing rocks falling through peopless houses and snow avalanches blocking the main roads has become the number one servicee our mountain forests are recognised for,'says Bernhard Maier, local forester in Schruns,, Austria. The problem is that we do not know exactly how a forest that provides optimall protection forest looks like. Critical for improving mountain forest management is deepeningg insight into the interaction between natural hazards and mountain forests, in particularr into the role of rockfall in forest dynamics, Maier says. Thee knowledge on this subject is still very limited due to the slow reaction of natural forestss to the rapid environmental and socio-economic changes, which occurred in the Europeann Alps during the last 100 years.
