The inferred central mass is 1.3 million suns, while the disk mass may be on the order of 0.1 million suns, based on a nearly Keplerian rotation curve. The bipolar, wide-angle outflow appears to contain ``bullets'' ejected from within <0.1 pc of the central mass. The positions of filaments and bullets observed in the AGN ionization cone on kpc-scales suggest that the disk channels the flow to a radius of about 0.4 pc, at which the flow appears to disrupt the disk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:9kBY04P_Y_YC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14886283705959592902", "cites_id": ["14886283705959592902"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xjNo3yi0ls4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1}}
