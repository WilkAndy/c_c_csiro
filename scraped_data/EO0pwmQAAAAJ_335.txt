In the observer plane, scattering produces a speckle pattern. Observations of this pattern on short baselines provide a measure of the size of the source. Observations on long baselines provide information about the spatial structure of the pulsar's emission region. Observations of this pattern for the Vela pulsar are in good agreement with theory, and should provide a picture of the Vela pulsar as a function of pulse phase."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6UW509z96lEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12418846109632514991", "cites_id": ["12418846109632514991"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2000aprs.conf..117G", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r0vjJL2aWKwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
