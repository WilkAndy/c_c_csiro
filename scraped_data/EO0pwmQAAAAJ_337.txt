We discuss here our survey methods, identification procedure and first results. Our survey is found to be 95% efficient at finding blazars, a figure which is comparable to or greater than that achieved by other radio and X-ray survey techniques. DXRBS provides a much more uniform coverage of the parameter space occupied by blazars than any previous survey. Particularly important is the identification of a large population of flat-spectrum radio quasars with ratios of X-ray to radio luminosity \u2273 10\u22126 (\u03b1 rx. \u2272 0.78) and of many low-luminosity flat-spectrum radio quasars. Moreover, DXRBS fills in the region of parameter space between X-ray selected and radio-selected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2hxEYnSErgUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12765595806969325332", "cites_id": ["12765595806969325332"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-49460-7_35", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FGefXMCBKLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
