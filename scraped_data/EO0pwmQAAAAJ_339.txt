In this paper we will review the results of these observations and give a brief summary of our interpretation, concentrating on the evolution of the sub-parsec-scale jet structure with time; subluminal component motions and rapid short timescale evolution. A full description of this work is soon to be published in a major journal article."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:xEh6bupSuykC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15297107059745187659", "cites_id": ["15297107059745187659"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/subparsecscale-structure-and-evolution-of-centaurus-a-at-84-and-222-ghz/3E8FA97C2274C7A49DF9685946CF803A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S2c7w9I9StQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1}}
