Attempts to identify optical counterparts, to measure redshifts, have so far proved unsuccessful and this has lead to radio and millimetre spectral line observations. We present our discovery of an absorption system at z = 0.19. A brief description is also made of our ATCA observations to measure the lensing time delay for this source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:B9zx5l6rxUEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7029087770206271710", "cites_id": ["7029087770206271710"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/measuring-the-properties-of-the-gravitational-lens-pks-1830211/FBAE777A4645D9A74E51DF2710826246", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3vgv1hVWjGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
