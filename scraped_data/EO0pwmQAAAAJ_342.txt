It is found that the exponential law is a marginally better approximation, whereas an expanding plasmon model actually predicts a power law type decay. The reason for this is due to relativistic aberration, time dilation and the Doppler effect, in going from the rest frame of the ejecta to the observer's frame. This effect is relevant for telescopes in which the beamwidth encompasses both approaching and receding plasmons, e.g. the radio monitoring programs at GBI and the Ryle Telescope."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4E1Y8I9HL1wC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10371391911698908617", "cites_id": ["10371391911698908617"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0083665696000578", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yUUsY_6V7o8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1}}
