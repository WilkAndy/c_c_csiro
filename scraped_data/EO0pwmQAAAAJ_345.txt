Thirty three objects were successfully detected on baselines of > 30M\u03bb at 2.3 GHz. For 21 of these sources, the flux density in the compact components contributes more than half the total flux density of the radio emission. Twenty sources showed structure more complex than a point-source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:dyGod8kC9dQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18393054431753846528", "cites_id": ["18393054431753846528"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/single-baseline-vlbi-survey-of-southern-peaked-spectrum-sources/16A24D4420DCA1263A769A6A3B81632D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AL8cG45BQf8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
