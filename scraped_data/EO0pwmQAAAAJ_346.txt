The differential astrometry analysis results in high-precision determinations of proper motions and parallaxes.  The astrophysical implications and astrometric consequences of these results are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:vMKmsr18IoIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5480052988956747964", "cites_id": ["5480052988956747964"], "pub_url": "https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/31769", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vKgVrSgPDUwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1}}
