The data includes high time resolution simultaneous H- and K-band photometry taken while Cygnus X-3 was flaring violently at these wavelengths and also more extensive infrared photometry of the quiescent spectrum of the source than has been previously reported. All the data were recorded at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) in August 1984."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:za7pDTvVV8kC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17615649076408876837", "cites_id": ["17615649076408876837"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-0794-5_87", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Jf9J14Bbd_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1}}
