These samples are being used for a variety of investigations, including a determination of the space distribution and luminosity function of radio QSOs, their radio size distribution, as well as the structures of the individual sources. Accurate positions are being determined, as well, in order to establish an extra-galactic position reference frame in the southern hemisphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6QQEcPiluMcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12277720692101804493", "cites_id": ["12277720692101804493"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/complete-samples-of-flat-spectrum-radio-sources-from-the-parkes-27-ghz-survey/BBF7ED8BB91F4DB14F0505BB43C1D47C", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zfEwWOs5Y6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1}}
