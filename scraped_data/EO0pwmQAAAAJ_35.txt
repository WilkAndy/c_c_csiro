X-ray emission from the Seyfert 2 galaxy GSN 069 (2MASX J01190869-3411305) at a redshift of z = 0.018 was first detected in July 2010 and implies an X-ray brightening by a factor of more than 240 over ROSAT observations performed 16 years earlier,. The emission has smoothly decayed over time since 2010, possibly indicating a long-lived tidal disruption event. The X-ray spectrum is ultra-soft and can be described by accretion disk emission with luminosity proportional to the fourth power of the disk temperature during long-term evolution. Here we report observations of quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions from the nucleus of GSN 069 over the course of 54 days, from December 2018 onwards. During these eruptions, the X-ray \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:aWrUoCkCBaEC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9481269674401538235", "cites_id": ["9481269674401538235"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1556-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uyBj8og8lIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 20, "2021": 23, "2022": 39, "2023": 35}}
