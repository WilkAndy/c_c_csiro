Since Centaurus A is the nearest active galaxy, VLBI investigations are important because the physical processes in the nucleus can be studied in greater linear detail than in other similar galaxies. Previous VLBI observations of Centaurus A have been hampered by its southerly declination (\u221243\u00b0) and the sparsity of VLBI capability in the southern hemisphere, leading to only scattered single point u, v coverage. This paper presents results from the early stages of development of a southern hemisphere VLBI network."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:OkCShBBh3G8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1716557839330886020", "cites_id": ["1716557839330886020"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/vlbi-observations-of-the-nucleus-of-centaurus-a/6FB32C8D2D7F30DE99AAD75D410FE491", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hMG6mUJw0hcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1}}
