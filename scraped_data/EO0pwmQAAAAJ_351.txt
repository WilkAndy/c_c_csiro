The spectral energy distribution of SN 1996cr in 2020, at age t \u223c8700\u2009d, is a power-law, with flux density, S \u221d \u03bd\u22120.588 \u00b1 0.011 between 1 and 34\u2009GHz, but may steepen at >35\u2009GHz. The spectrum has flattened since t = 5370\u2009d (2010). Also since t = 5370\u2009d, the flux density has declined rapidly, with . The VLBI image at t = 8859\u2009d shows an approximately circular structure with a central minimum reminiscent of an optically-thin spherical shell of emission. For a distance of 3.7\u2009Mpc, the average outer radius of the radio emission at t = 8859\u2009d was (5.1 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1017\u2009cm, and SN 1996cr has been expanding with a velocity of 4650 \u00b1 1060\u2009km\u2009s\u22121 between t \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:XdwVV_xN3QMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/521/2/2239/7031775", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bfa0N8FCp4EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
