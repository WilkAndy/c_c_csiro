We observed MAXI J1348-630 for 12 months in the radio band with MeerKAT, as part of the ThunderKAT collaboration, and with the ATCA interferometer, while monitoring in X-rays with the MAXI and Swift satellites. During multiple outburst phases, black hole X-ray binaries are able to launch powerful radio-emitting jets of plasma at relativistic speeds. These systems are mostly observed in our Galaxy and allow us to study the jet formation and emission on human timescales, making it possible to unveil the mechanisms that link accretion and ejection in compact objects. Multi-wavelength observations are fundamental to achieve this goal. While tracking the outburst evolution, as the system transitioned between the canonical hard and soft spectral states, we detected two relativistic radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GMADQvFTV88C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021cosp...43E1220C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
