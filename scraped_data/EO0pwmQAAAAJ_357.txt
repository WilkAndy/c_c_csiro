Theoretical models suggest that BHs are born when a massive star dies, either with or without a supernova explosion. BHs born with a supernova explosion should get strong natal kicks, whereas direct collapse BHs do not incur such a kick. We are measuring the proper motions (few mas/yr) of BH X-ray binary (BHXB) systems during their hard states by using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) networks all over the globe, including the European VLBI Network. Combining the proper motion with the radial velocity and distance to the system, the full three-dimensional space velocity can be obtained. The system can then be traced back in time through the Galactic potential to estimate the magnitude of the natal kick that could have put the binary system into its Galactocentric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:IZKZNMMMWs0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://evnsymp2018.iaa.es/sites/default/files/PDF/Atri_ID42.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
