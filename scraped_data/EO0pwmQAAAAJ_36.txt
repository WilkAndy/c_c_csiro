Indeed, before Fermi/LAT (Large Area Telescope), it was known that \u03b3 rays from AGNs are produced in blazars and radio galaxies, but now we have to also add RL-NLS1s. NLS1s are active nuclei similar to Seyferts, where the optical permitted lines emitted from the broad-line region (BLR) are narrower than usual, with FWHM (H\u03b2)< 2000 km s\u2212 1 (see Pogge 2000, for a review). Other characteristics are [O III]/H\u03b2< 3 and a bump of Fe II, making them a peculiar class of AGN. NLS1s are different from Seyfert 2s, whose optical spectra typically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:xoCRtiy2jdkC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15809489259095040826", "cites_id": ["15809489259095040826"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/707/1/727/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OqO2CLiWZtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 11, "2011": 11, "2012": 13, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
