We study the spectral evolution between quiescent and flaring periods of 22 radio-loud AGN through multi-epoch, quasi-simultaneous broadband spectra. For many of these sources these are the first broadband studies. We use a Bayesian block analysis of \\Fermi/LAT light curves in order to determine time ranges of constant flux for constructing quasi-simultaneous SEDs. The shapes of the resulting 81 SEDs are described by two logarithmic parabolas and a blackbody spectrum where needed. For low states the peak frequencies and luminosities agree well with the blazar sequence, higher luminosity implying lower peak frequencies. This is not true for sources in a high state. The -ray photon index in Fermi/LAT correlates with the synchrotron peak frequency in low and intermediate states. No correlation is present in high states. The black hole mass cannot be determined from the SEDs. Surprisingly, the thermal excess often found in FSRQs at optical/UV wavelengths can be described by blackbody emission and not an accretion disk spectrum. The \"harder-when-brighter\" trend, typically seen in X-ray spectra of flaring blazars, is visible in the blazar sequence. Our results for low and intermediate states, as well as the Compton dominance, are in agreement with previous results. Black hole mass estimates using the parameters from Bonchi (2013) are in agreement with some of the more direct measurements. For two sources, estimates disagree by more than four orders of magnitude, possibly due to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QzrXvYNrFw4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00841", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pPFj8EOtTNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
