Fortunately, site protection was recognized as an important ongoing function of the IAU, and the work of the Commission is continuing as Commission C.B7. The Commission has its primary association with Division B because of the technical aspects of its work and association with ground-based facilities, while it has the support of Division C as an Inter-Division Commission because of the strong need for educating the public on the issues."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:boGf3zyra0UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-international-astronomical-union/article/triennial-report/B54F6C6CD6426FB37FB255CF9C64774D", "cites_per_year": {}}
