The optical imaging observations reveal the presence of tidal tail features which provide strong evidence that the host galaxy has undergone a major merger in the recent past. The merger hypothesis is further supported by the detection of a young stellar population (YSP), which, on the basis of spectral synthesis modelling of our deep Very Large Telescope (VLT) optical spectra, was formed 50\u2013250 Myr ago and makes up a significant fraction of the total stellar mass (1\u201330 per cent). Despite the core-jet structure of the radio source, which is consistent with the idea that the jet is pointing close to our line of sight, our H i 21-cm observations reveal significant H i absorption associated with both the core and the jet.
