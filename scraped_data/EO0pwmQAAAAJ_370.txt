We present a search for a similarly massive jet earlier in the same outburst using high-resolution X-ray spectra from the Chandra HETGS. Despite a detection of radio emission with ATCA, we find no evidence of a heavy jet in the X-ray spectrum, with tight upper limits on the relativistic emission lines seen by D\u00edaz Trigo eight months later. Instead, we find deep absorption lines from a massive, highly ionized disk wind, whose properties can be probed with detailed photoionization models. We explore several scenarios to explain the two modes of massive outflow in this remarkable black hole system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:-GalPxRzH2oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014fysc.confP..48N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
