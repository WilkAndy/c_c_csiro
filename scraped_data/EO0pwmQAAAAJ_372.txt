The main goal of this project is to study the physics of AGN cores and the properties of the ISM by observing AGNs up to the longest RadioAstron projected baseline lengths and measuring the core's geometry and brightness temperature while taking the influence of the ISM into full consideration. These observations will enable the highest resolution ever achieved in direct astronomical observations at the proposed wavelengths."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:PflRiyi98mgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6426R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
