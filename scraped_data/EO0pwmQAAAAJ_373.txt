The lobes are likely due to the interaction of relativistic plasma with the ISM. This ATCA proposal has allowed similar discovery in H 1743-322, and therefore that it maybe a common occurrence in the Galaxy. Recently, we have witnessed with ATCA the formation of similar lobes in the black hole GX 339-4. We propose to use the Compact Array to continue our search for radio lobes in microquasars that have been active in the past years. The proposed observations are optimized to discover and study (flux evolution, morphology, SED, proper motion,...) new radio lobes from microquasars. This will have implications not only for the study of jets from Galactic X-ray binaries, but also for our understanding of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:t2c9fUEjrewC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6373C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
