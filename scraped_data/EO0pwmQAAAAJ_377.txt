However, the three-dimensional jet magnetic field structure and particle composition (whether electron-proton or electron-positron) are still poorly constrained observationally and remain fundamental yet unanswered questions. Circular polarisation, measured as Stokes V, in the radio continuum emission from jets is a powerful diagnostic of the jet magnetic field and particles since, unlike linear polarisation, it is expected to remain almost completely unmodified by external screens. SS433 is one of the most celebrated of Galactic objects. The source is an X-ray binary system consisting of a mass-losing star in a 13 day orbit with a stellar-mass black hole. The system produces bright quasi-continuous radio jets that precess \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.6075C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
