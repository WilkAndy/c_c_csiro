From the 15 Water Fountains discovered so far, only six have been observed in VLBI capabilities. The resolution of the LBA is ideal for this project since its longest baseline (ATCA to Hartebeesthoek) can provide a resolution of 0.3 mas. The emission is resolved at this resolution and we will be able to identify individual spots. The monitoring nature of our project will give us the potential to study the 3-dimensional motions of these spots and study the structure of the jets that host the water masers. Our study will also focus on the existence of a magnetic field and through its strength and orientation, we will examine their role in the formation of the bi-and multi-polar outflows observed in Planetary Nebulae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014atnf.prop.5953G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
