The exquisite resolution afforded by these baselines provides a unique opportunity to probe nearby pulsars and the interstellar plasma that scatters their radio emission. We summarize the Early Science Program for pulsar study with RadioAstron and discuss general properties of visibilities on space-ground baselines for several objects. We present preliminary results on B0950+ 08, which lies within the Local Bubble and is weakly scattered. These results indicate markedly different scattering characteristics than those of more distant pulsars. We also present observations of the Vela pulsar on Earth-space baselines, so long that they should completely resolve the scattering disk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:rbgNTKsR3fAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22321201J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
