The ATCA synthesis telescope is an east-west array consisting of six 22-m antennas. It uses orthogonal linearly polarized feeds and records full Stokes parameters. We carried out all observations simultaneously at 4.8 GHz (6.3 cm)/8.64 GHz (3.5 cm) and in a limited cases also at 1.384 GHz (21.7 cm)/2.496 GHz (12.0 cm)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:MU1jWE1llqsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014yCat..74282500C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
