Our results show that both the emission latitude and the east-west asymmetry in surface brightness have gradually decreased since day 7000 (mid-2006), reflecting the increasing interaction of the forward shock with the circumstellar material. We found a constant expansion rate of~ 4000km/s for the radio remnant, but no conclusive evidence of deceleration. We compare the results with the evolution of the remnant in X-rays and discuss the physical environment of the circumstellar material."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014cosp...40E2267N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
