We have observed such structures in the scattering of the Vela pulsar in previous observations using RadioAstron and the ATNF LBA, on baselines so long that the average visibility is expected to be zero. We propose additional observations of the Vela pulsar and 3 other strong, heavily-scattered pulsars on space-Earth baselines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:iINcni2fUZgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5747G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
