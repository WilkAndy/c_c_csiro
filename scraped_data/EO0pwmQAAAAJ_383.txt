We wish to observe black hole X-ray transients in outburst in order to study the jet associated with hard state phases and the ejections which typically take place during state transition. Coupled to complementary multi-wavelength observations (mostly, optical, infrared and X-ray) this work will enable further understanding of the physical mechanisms of outbursts as well as the conditions under which jet ejections take place."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:1GbOEZ86UTAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5794C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
