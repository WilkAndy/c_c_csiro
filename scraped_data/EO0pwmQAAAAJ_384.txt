RQ AGN vary dramatically in the X-rays, while the amplitude of their variability at 5 and 8.5 GHz is smaller. If radio emission from these flat-spectrum sources is due to self absorbed synchrotron, their variability would increase with frequency. For the most part, RQ AGN have not been observed at high frequencies of~ 100 GHz. We propose to measure the flux of three RQ AGN with ATCA at 95 GHz, and to re-observe them within two weeks in order to get a general idea of their variability. The next step will be to choose the brightest source among the three and to propose simultaneous radio and X-ray monitoring. These observations will reveal the first high-frequency radio insight into the inner parts of an accretion disk coronal structure that is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5660B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
