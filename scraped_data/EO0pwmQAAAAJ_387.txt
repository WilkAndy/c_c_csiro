Scattering of this pulsar would predict negligible average visibility, V 10^-150, on this baseline. The fringes may indicate the presence of refractive substructure within the scattering disk. Additional observations of Vela on different Earth-space baselines, and of the heavily-scattered pulsar B1641-45, will help to understand the origin of this surprising detection, the longest in units of wavelength for any astrophysical radio source."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lEqHes_HPG0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5507G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
