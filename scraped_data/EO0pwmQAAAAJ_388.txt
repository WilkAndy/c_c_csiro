AGN radio emission is thought to be produced by synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons that is Doppler boosted through relativistic bulk motion. Inverse Compton scattering imposes a theoretical limit of 10^ 12 K on the brightness temperature of synchrotron radiation in the rest frame of the emitting plasma. It is well known that a number of AGN exceed this by at least 1.5 orders of magnitude, but the extent of the excess is unknown since measurements only place lower bounds on the actual brightness temperature in many cases. With the launch of the RadioAstron 10 m space radio telescope, we are now capable of making direct measurements of extreme brightness temperatures. Here we propose to undertake space VLBI measurements of three ultra-compact, bright AGN with the LBA and RadioAstron in April 2013, as part of the RadioAstron \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:E2dP09oujfMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5542B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
