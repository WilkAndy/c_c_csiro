It may be the much more luminous a\" wild cousin\" of SN 1987A, in that it seems to have exploded in a low density bubble surrounded by a high density shell of material swept up from a previous mass-loss phase. A complex morphology is suggested by both the X-ray spectra and by the non-zero closure phases seen in our earlier LBA observations. The proposed observations will allow us to make an image to reveal the morphology, and determine whether it is shell-like, axi-symmetric, or perhaps centre-filled with some emission due to the stellar remnant of the explosion. We should also be able to determine a reliable and representative estimate of the forward-shock radius, which is a crucial constraint for the hydrodynamic simulations.
