Inverse Compton scattering imposes a theoretical limit of 10^ 12 K on the brightness temperature of synchrotron radiation in the rest frame of the emitting plasma. It is well known that a number of AGN exceed this by at least 1.5 orders of magnitude, but the extent of the excess is unknown since measurements only place lower bounds on the actual brightness temperature in many cases. With the RadioAstron 10 m space radio telescope, we can make direct measurements of extreme brightness temperatures. Submitted LBA proposal V496 has the goal of probing the highest brightness temperatures in AGN, both directly by measuring the visibilities on projected baseline lengths of 4-5 billion wavelengths at 6 cm, and indirectly though the effects of interstellar scattering \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7MdmnBSEV98C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5614B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
