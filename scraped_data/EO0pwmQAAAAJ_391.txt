Our goal is to increase the density of calibrators with positions accurate at a milliarcsecond level in those regions in the southern hemisphere where its density is still low, in particular in the Galactic plane. We will also produce estimates of correlated flux density and snap-shot images. The output catalogue of source positions will be of use for phase-referencing observations at the LBA, as a calibrator pool for the ATCA, ALMA, and SKA, for space navigation, and as a source list for geodetic observations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5418P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
