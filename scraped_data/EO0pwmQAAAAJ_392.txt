The radio observations indicate exponentially increasing flux density due to the increasing interaction of the shock front with circumstellar material. The next few years are critical in understanding the ongoing interaction of the supernova shock front with the circumstellar torus created by the progenitor star. SNR 1987A is a unique object which provides a detailed view of the transition of a supernova into a supernova remnant at close hand, across the wavelength spectrum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013atnf.prop.5592S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
