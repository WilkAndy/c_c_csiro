By studying the HI absorption that is associated with a radio source, we can investigate the interaction between the AGN and the gas in the host galaxy. Allison et al.(2012) reported the detection of two new associated absorption-lines towards compact radio sources. These systems exhibit very different properties, both in their spectral-line profiles and host galaxy morphology. High spatial-resolution observations, using the Long Baseline Array, will provide significant insight into the location of the absorbing gas within the host galaxy, and its interaction with the AGN. This project consists of two main components, firstly high spatial-resolution imaging of the two continuum sources to determine their parsec-scale radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.5287A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
