Despite early predictions of variability it has remained virtually unchanged over about 40 years. We propose VLBI observations at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz with the best ever VLBI array in the southern hemisphere (about 10 antennas). This will produce detailed high resolution images and will allow us to determine for the first time the structure and spectra of the individual components. This will enable us to determine whether the steep spectral cutoff observed is due to synchrotron self absorption (SSA) or free-free absorption (FFA) and further elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:e6AMIDGT8rIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4602T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
