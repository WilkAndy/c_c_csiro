Here we report high-resolution radio observations of a second Galactic superluminal radio source GRO J1655-40, which was detected as an X-ray transient2 on 27 July 1994. Our radio images reveal two components moving away from each other at an angular speed of 65 \u00b1 5 mas d-1, corresponding to superluminal motion at the estimated distance of 3\u20135 kpc. The 12-day delay between the X-ray and radio outbursts suggests that the ejection of material at relativistic speeds occurs during a stable phase of accretion onto a black hole, which follows an unstable phase with a high accretion rate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:eIWZJKaDF6kC", "num_citations": 431, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5685261098554658861", "cites_id": ["5685261098554658861"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/374141a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LZCy6tga5k4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 17, "1996": 31, "1997": 44, "1998": 30, "1999": 31, "2000": 22, "2001": 24, "2002": 20, "2003": 25, "2004": 11, "2005": 9, "2006": 24, "2007": 18, "2008": 12, "2009": 15, "2010": 8, "2011": 11, "2012": 9, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 2, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
