Twenty-five percent of the scientific time of this mission is devoted to a survey of 402 bright, small-diameter extra-galactic radio sources at 5 GHz. The major goals of the VSOP Survey are statistical in nature: to determine the brightness temperature and approximate structure; to provide a source list for use with future space VLBI missions; and to compare radio properties with other data throughout the EM spectrum. This paper describes: the compilation of a complete list of radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN); the selection of the subsample of sources to be observed with VSOP; the extensive ground resources used for the Survey; the status of the observations as of 2000 July; the data-analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:XfMaBeGYgSgC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12644680053396755487", "cites_id": ["12644680053396755487"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8201472/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H1QuoYPteq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 8, "2003": 16, "2004": 11, "2005": 9, "2006": 10, "2007": 8, "2008": 10, "2009": 10, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
