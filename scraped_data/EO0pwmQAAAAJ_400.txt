The proposed observations will combine observations on long baselines to the RadioAstron spacecraft with shorter Earth-based baselines. The long baselines will be among the longest yet explored, up to 330,000 km or nearly the distance to the Moon. These observations will extend earlier work on the size of the pulsar's radio emission region, and on the structure of the pulsar's scattering disk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Mr27SXpvooAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4877G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
