The radio emission of supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A is evolving rapidly with time, providing unique information on the interaction of the supernova shock front with the circumstellar medium. The remnant is now bright enough to be well-resolved by ATCA at high frequencies and by VLBI at low frequencies, providing an excellent insight into the evolving spectral index structure of the remnant and the corresponding particle acceleration mechanisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ax16qXk-rEQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4927Z/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
