The main goal of this project is to determine the correlated flux density, angular size, and brightness temperature of the most compact structure (s) in the AGN radio core located in the jet base. We will probe the inverse-Compton limit and Doppler boosting of AGN cores testing the current widely accepted jet model of synchrotron emitting relativistic electrons, inverse-Compton cooling, and relativistic beaming. These observations will enable the highest resolution ever achieved in astronomy. This proposal is submitted as part of the RadioAstron Early Science Program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:oA8UEeFZdjYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4930K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
