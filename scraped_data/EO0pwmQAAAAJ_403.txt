Given distance estimates of~ 1.5 kpc this would make it the second closest BHXRB. We believe ATCA-CABB has sufficient sensitivity to detect radio emission from the jets of a BHXRB at this distance. The faintest extremes of the radio/X-ray correlation for BHXRBs is anchored by a single quiescent source, leaving us with a poor understanding of coupling between accretion and feedback at low luminosities. A quiescent detection of J1357. 2-0933 would continue to fill this sparsely populated region, as well as contributing to the fundamental plane of black hole activity. Furthermore, additional correlation measurements have revealed a radio loud/quiet dichotomy suggesting our understanding of the factors behind this relationship remains incomplete.
