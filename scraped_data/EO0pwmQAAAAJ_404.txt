However, interpretations of HI absorption searches rely on the assumption that the HI column density drops off with increasing impact parameter. In contrast, recent studies show that extremely dense gas, with column densities up to~ 10^ 23 cm^-3 may exist in small filamentary structure (on scales of~ 100 pc). These structures are \u2018hidden\u2019from detection due to self-opacity. If the background continuum source being used to probe for absorption is extended in comparison to the dense filaments, this may result in a significant underestimation of the true HI column density. The VLBI observations proposed here will provide essential follow-up to ATCA project C2573, which is an on-going search for intervening HI absorption in nearby galaxies.
