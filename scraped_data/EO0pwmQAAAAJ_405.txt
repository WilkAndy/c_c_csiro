They used 1.1-3.1 GHz ATCA observations and modelling of the Faraday rotation measure (RM) to predict the structure and rotation measures of spatially unresolved polarised components of four active radio galaxies. We will directly test their predictions using the LBA, by directly imaging the polarised radio emission from these galaxies and deriving the RM of each polarised component. The outcomes of our proposed experiment will be (i) the first VLBI images of the polarised emission from the four active radio galaxies (ii) spatially resolved images and RMs for each polarised component (iii) a contribution to total intensity and polarised intensity flux monitoring for two potential ASKAP calibrator sources and (iv) a thorough test of the robustness of RM synthesis and multi-RM-component modelling, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4713H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
