Theoretical work suggests that the most massive black holes should form via direct collapse, whereas those less massive should undergo a natal supernova. During such a supernova, different magnitude velocity kicks can be imparted to the black hole, depending on the nature of the supernova. We propose supporting ATCA observations to trigger a joint program of high angular resolution LBA observations to test these predictions by measuring the proper motion of a black hole X-ray binary, which, when combined with the optically-determined systemic radial velocity and source distance, will provide the full three-dimensional space velocity of the system. Comparison with the predicted velocity from Galactic rotation will determine whether the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4565M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
