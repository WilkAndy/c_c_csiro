From the 13 Water Fountains discovered so far, only six have been observed in VLBI capabilities. Observations of these sources will also aim into confirming source IRAS 15103-5745 as a Water Fountain and classify it as the first Water Fountain-Planetary Nebula source. The resolution of the LBA is ideal for this project since its longest baseline (ATCA to Hartebeesthoek) can provide a resolution of 0.3 mas. The emission is resolved at this resolution and we will be able to identify individual spots. The monitoring nature of our project will give us the potential to study the 3-dimensional motions of these spots and study the structure of the jets that host the water masers. Our study will also focus on the existence of magnetic field and through their strength \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012atnf.prop.4878G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
