Eleven cases of simultaneous double QPOs occurred, with significances of up to 6.3 and 5.5 \u03c3 and centroid frequencies ranging between approximately 56 and 225 and 230 and 500 Hz for the two QPO peaks, respectively, ie, for the most part at frequencies well below those of other sources. The QPO properties clearly indicate that these double peaks are the kHz QPOs known from low magnetic field neutron stars, and not black hole high-frequency QPOs, confirming that Cir X-1 is a neutron star, as suspected since the detection of type I X-ray bursts from the field of the source 20 years ago. The kHz QPO peak separation varies over a wide range,~ 175-340 Hz, and increases as a function of kHz QPO frequency. This is contrary to what has been observed in other sources but in good agreement with predictions of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:37Fl7vPTsUIC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=246380580041284901", "cites_id": ["246380580041284901"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/508934/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JV3qCNVRawMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 12, "2008": 18, "2009": 9, "2010": 11, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
