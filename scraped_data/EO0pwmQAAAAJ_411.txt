We have now found radio emission in a CV of dwarf nova type (SS Cyg) as well as in one nova-like CV (V3885 Sgr). Clearly, this small sample should be enlarged. Here, we propose to observe VW Hyi with the ATCA, which is one of the nearest and brightest southern dwarf novae, as part of a multi-wavelength campaign covering the X-ray, optical, near-infrared and radio bands."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4413K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
