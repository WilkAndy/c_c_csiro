Such a system provides an excellent opportunity to study the physics of jets in the absence of a black hole engine. Recent CABB observations of Circinus X-1 at 7mm, 3cm and 6cm wavelengths have indicated that the system's jets are behaving differently to what has been observed in the past. With indications of a variable jet axis and inclination to line of sight, as well as structural variations detected predominantly to the north-west of the source (previously associated with the receding jet), we are lead to conclude that the structure of the system's outflows has changed significantly, perhaps as a result of an increased level of precession. In order to better investigate jet structure and the cause of these changes, we propose a group of new CABB observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4437C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
