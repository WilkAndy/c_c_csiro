The mission, scheduled for launch in November 2011, carries a Russian probe to Phobos and a Chinese Mars orbiter. In addition to preparing for further VLBI observations of these spacecraft during their Mars-orbiting phases, the proposed observations, which will be made in collaboration with Chinese VLBI Network stations, will enable scientific studies of the interplanetary medium and of relativistic gravity parameters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4391E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
