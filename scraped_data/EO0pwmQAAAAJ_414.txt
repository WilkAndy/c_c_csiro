Optical images have been used to model the host galaxy morphology confirming it to be dominated by a strong (and warped) disk component that is observed close to edge-on to the line of sight. This is the first radio galaxy found to reside in a disk dominated galaxy with radio luminosity equivalent to powerful FRII objects. At radio wavelengths, PKS 1814-637 is about 480 pc in diameter and it is classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) source; such sources are usually considered to be radio sources observed in the early stages of their evolution. However, the optical and mid-IR spectroscopic properties of PKS1814-637 show more in common with Seyfert galaxies than they do with radio galaxies, with the detection of H2, and PAH emission features, along with HI and silicate absorption features, providing evidence for a rich ISM which is likely to be related to the disk morphology of the host galaxy. We argue that the interaction between the radio plasma and the rich ISM in this and similar objects may have boosted their radio emission, allowing them to more easily enter flux limited samples of radio sources. In this case, PKS 1814-637 represents a type of\u201d imposter\u201d: an intrinsically low power object that is selected in a radio flux limited sample because of the unusually efficient conversion of jet power into radio emission. This would make PKS 1814-637 an extreme example of the effects of jet-cloud interactions in galaxies containing a rich ISM, and perhaps a missing link between radio galaxies and radio \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:MJ-TmkugpmcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katherine-Inskip/publication/51935090_PKS_1814-637_A_powerful_radio-loud_AGN_in_a_disk_galaxy/links/02bfe50ea9d65e1dee000000/PKS-1814-637-A-powerful-radio-loud-AGN-in-a-disk-galaxy.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ME5S5jK1wmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
