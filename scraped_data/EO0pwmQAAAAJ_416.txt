Should this be the case, it would violate the common assumption that jet speeds are related to the escape speed from the compact object from which they are launched. We wish to directly measure the proper motions of the jets in Circinus X-1 using the high angular resolution of the LBA. This will constrain the jet speed, inclination angle, and the orbital phase at which the jets are launched. These ATCA observations (totalling 11 hours of time) will monitor the source every periastron passage to trigger the LBA observations in our joint proposal on detection of a flare that is sufficiently bright for resolved LBA imaging. Confirming whether neutron stars can launch ultra-relativistic jets would provide important insights into the necessary and sufficient conditions for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nnVijz9KPVYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011atnf.prop.4089M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
