VLBI imaging at 1.4 and 1.7 GHz taken in 2007 and 2008 with the Australian Long Baseline Array provides the highest resolution radio images of the remnant to date, revealing two extended lobes with an overall morphology consistent with observations at lower resolutions. We find evidence of small-scale features in the radio remnant, which possibly consist of discrete clumps near the inner surface of the shell. These features have spatial extent smaller than 0.2\" and contribute less than 13% of the total remnant flux. We also report new X-ray observation taken in 2010 August with the High Resolution Camera onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Comparing to the 2008 April exposure with the same instrument, the remnant flux increased by 43% in the 0.08-10 kev range and the relative brightness of the X-ray lobes around \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:8k3R5ScbChQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21725627N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
