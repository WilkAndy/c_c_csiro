Previous measurements have shown time delayed emission between near-IR and radio/submm. Here, we present two new aspects of the variability of Sgr A* across the electromagnetic spectrum. One is evidence for dimming of submm and radio flux during the peak of near-IR flare emission. This is consistent with recent finding that the variability of Sgr A* in radio and submm wavelengths is anti-correlated with near-IR flare emission. This newly recognized behavior is consistent with adiabatically cooling plasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background quiescent emission from Sgr A*.
