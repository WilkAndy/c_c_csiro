This object appears to be one of the best examples of Seyfert galaxies where shocks produced by the radio plasma jet influence both the radio and the near-infrared emission. The picture resulting from the new observations of IC 5063 confirms and completes the one derived from previous Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) lower resolution observations. A strong interaction between the radio plasma ejected from the nucleus and a molecular cloud of the interstellar medium (ISM) is occurring at the position of the western hot spot, about 0.6 kpc from the active nucleus. Because of this interaction, the gas is swept up, forming around the radio lobe a cocoon-like structure where the gas is moving at high speed. Because of this, part of the molecular gas is dissociated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:tYdqGa2HnWcC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7356750239704337193", "cites_id": ["7356750239704337193"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/301358/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KcvYgl1tGGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 5, "2004": 12, "2005": 6, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
