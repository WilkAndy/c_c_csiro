As such, they provide an excellent opportunity to study the physics behind relativistic outflows without the presence of a black hole engine: acting as control sources with which we can investigate any dependencies jet formation and structure may have on unique phenomena such as the ergosphere and event horizon. 7mm observations will yield the highest resolution ATCA images yet for the two systems, allowing us to capture structure close to the neutron stars themselves, nearing the mysterious jet launch region. Currently, no mm detections of neutron star binaries have been made, and as a result, a large gap remains in spectra associated with the group. The region in question covers part of the jet line which must turn over at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3648F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
