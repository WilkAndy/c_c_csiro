Our intention is to study the behaviour of the inner part of the accretion disc as inferred from the X-ray observations of the Fe emission line and the kHz quasi-periodic oscillations, and to link it to the properties of the radio jet. To achieve this goal we request 5\u00d7 11h of observing time with ATCA, scheduled at regular intervals in the period 2010 August 27-October 13, the visibility window of the granted X-ray observations with RXTE (PI: Mendez) and Suzaku (PI: Linares)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3654T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
