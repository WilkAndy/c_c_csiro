Frequency signals are L1 (1575.25 MHz) and L2 (1227.6 MHz) for GPS, GLONASS have individual frequencies around G1 (1600 MHz) and G2 (1250 MHz). We want first evaluate tracking capability at each telescope with Lband receiver: Mopra, Parkes, Hobart, and one ATCA station. Satellite signals are very strong, thus, it is important to know: the necessary attenuation and also if antennas really can track the satellites, the apparent motions are of about 0.5 degree for min. As second step VLBI network observation sessions with the four stations will be planned to determine the satellites coordinates. A possible setup is for example to follow the satellite orbits by re-positioning the telescopes every 20 second, and to record 10 second \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010atnf.prop.3670T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
