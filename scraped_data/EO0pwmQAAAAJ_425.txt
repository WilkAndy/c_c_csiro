Neither system was detected. Radio flux density upper limits (3 sigma) of 26 micro Jy (at 5.5 GHz), 47 micro Jy (at 9 GHz) for GRO J1655-40, and 1.4 mJy (at 1.75 GHz), 27 micro Jy (at 5.5 GHz), 47 micro Jy (at 9 GHz) for XTE J1550-564 were measured. In conjunction with quasi-simultaneous Chandra X-ray observations (in the case of GRO J1655-40) and Faulkes Telescope optical observations (XTE J1550-564) we find that these systems provide the first evidence of relativelyradio quiet'black hole binaries at low luminosities; indicating that the scatter observed in the hard state X-ray: radio correlation at higher luminosities may also extend towards quiescent levels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:vzY-6mMDyDUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11209332454947845014&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
