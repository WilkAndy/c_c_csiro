For example in X-rays this is done for several years already with\" all-sky\" monitors built into satellites. They can alert the community of any interesting transient events, to trigger multi-wavelength observations. With LOFAR, the Low Frequency Array [1], a new instrument is added to this list with capabilities to monitor the low frequency radio sky at several timescales for shorter and longer variations. Pulsars, flare stars, planets and exoplanets are possible sources of these variations and, opening up a new window, thus far undetected phenomena may also be found, from coherent radiation processes in compact objects, such as neutron stars, white dwarfs and black holes. This is more likely at low frequency because the size of the emitting region for the currently known processes is comparable with these wavelengths. The LOFAR Transients Key Science Project is setting up the Radio Sky Monitor [2] to study the transient radio sky at time scales large then one second, while the Cosmic Ray Key Science Project develops techniques to image cosmic ray air showers [3], as well as lunar cascades caused by ultra high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays (NuMoon project [4]), at a timeresolution below 10 nanoseconds. With FRATs they combine their expertise to set up an observation mode for LOFAR to detect and identify sub-second single pulses of Fast Radio Transients in real-time.To monitor the sky, the optimum is to view the whole sky all the time, because if an event happens \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QAOzB4mb83kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/83582/83582.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U9ksSI5N78IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
