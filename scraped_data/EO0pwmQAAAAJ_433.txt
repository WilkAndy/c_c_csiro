Extragalactic jets south of -30 degrees declination are observed at 8.4 GHz and 22 GHz every two months at milliarcsecond resolution. The initial TANAMI sample is a hybrid radio and gamma-ray selected sample since the combination of VLBI and gamma-ray observations is crucial to understand the broadband emission characteristics of AGN."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:QobCCQ6YufAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0686", "cites_per_year": {}}
