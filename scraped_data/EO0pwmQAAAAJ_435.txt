Comparison of this jet with those from black holes acts as a perfect'control'to see which aspects of black hole jet formation are actually associated with eg the ergosphere or event horizon, and not just products of the accretion flow. We propose for comprehensive monitoring of Circinus X-1 around an entire 17-day orbit, simultaneously with X-ray observations from the new Japanese facility, MAXI, onboard the international space station. These observations could provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the physics of the coupling between accretion and jet formation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2689F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
