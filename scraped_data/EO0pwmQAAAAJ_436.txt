We have recently observed two nova-like CVs with the ATCA. The map of V3885 Sgr showed a 0.14 mJy radio source coincident with the source position, while the noise in the map was 0.03 mJy. Thus, this' detection'was only\u223c 4.6 sigma. Given this low significance we would not like to claim a detection of a new class of radio sources without further confirmation. Here, we propose to observe the source for 12 hours with the improved ATCA to confirm or falsify the existence of radio emission from this source. This detection would be the first radio detection of a nova-like cataclysmic variable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2703K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
