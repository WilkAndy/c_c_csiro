The mechanism (s) of jet production, however, remains essentially unconstrained. The jet is formed very close the compact object, where the radiative emission is released mostly in the X-ray band, so it is crucial to coordinate radio (the band where the jet dominates over the other components of such systems) and X-ray studies. In the accretion state where the jet is active, we observe a non-thermal hard X-ray power-law (above 20 keV) whose origin is still an area of controversy: Comptonizingcorona'or base of the jet itself. In order to investigate the role of the boundary layers on the specific mechanism (s) for the jet production, and specifically to answer the question:\" can the emission from the base of the jet alone be responsible for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2750M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
