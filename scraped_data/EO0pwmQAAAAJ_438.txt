Following up on ToO radio and X-ray observations of this system last year, we wish to make a deeper observation with ATCA-CABB to test for the existence of a black hole in the system accreting at a very low level. This may potentially lead to the confirmation of V Pup as the closest black hole to the earth, provide us with a unique example of a stellar-mass black hole unaffected by X-ray binary evolution, and extend the radio: X-ray correlation for all black holes by a further two orders of magnitude."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2574F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
