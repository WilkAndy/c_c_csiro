The primary goal of the ATCA observations is to provide information on the total and polarised emission from the compact components in these sources, for correlation with parameters obtained from VSOP imaging observations. These data represent the first high resolution, long timescale flux density monitoring observations of a large number of southern compact radio sources. In the future, comparison of the ATCA and VSOP data will be used to investigate relativistic beaming models and identify similarities or differences between the major classes of extragalactic radio sources.
