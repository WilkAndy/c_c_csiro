The RXTE PCA count rate has been dropping since 2009 June 23. We have analyzed the PCA data taken between 2009 June 26 and July 7. Quick fits to all sets with a power law+ diskbb+ smedge model were performed. While the flux was decreasing steadily, the spectral index stayed between 2.2 and 2.1 until 2009 July 4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:U5I91ptAnUUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ATel.2112....1K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
