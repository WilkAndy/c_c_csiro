This project is a systematic search for gravitational lenses in the southern hemisphere sky through the use of data from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) survey. We have been following up on our list of candidates by observing them at higher resolution to obtain spectral index, component strength and morphological information. Our previous searches have provided us with~ 10 interesting sources that need to be followed up at higher resolutions of VLBI. We have also obtained two promising sources which we intend to image using the ATCA in the CABB correlator mode to obtain high resolution and high sensitivity images.
