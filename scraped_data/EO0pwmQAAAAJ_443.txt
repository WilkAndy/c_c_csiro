Study of lenses through systematic blind surveys provides an important and independent way of constraining different cosmological parameters through statistical studies. We have embarked upon such a systematic search in the southern hemisphere through the use of data from the Australian Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) Survey. Our previous 7mm imaging follow-ups have provided us with 13 sources of interest which we intend to follow up on higher resolution using the VLBI method. On this proposal, we request for time to follow-up on the 13 candidates at higher resolution, first to identify candidates for further follow-up by obtaining \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ODN9lDrI8hIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2323C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
