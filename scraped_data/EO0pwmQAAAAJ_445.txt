Their radio activity seems plausibly triggered by an AGN, but radio powers, sizes and spectra are not fully consistent with the ones expected for standard jet-dominated radio galaxy populations. Low radiative efficiency accretion models (eg ADAF), possibly coexisting with outflows and jets may be a viable explanation. In order to verify this hypothesis we carried out multi-frequency (5, 8, 19 GHz) radio observations with the ATCA in 2007/2008. From our preliminary analysis we find a general steepening of the spectra going from low to high radio frequency, favoring jet-dominated accretion scenarios. Nevertheless coexistence of jet and ADAF or even pure ADAF accretion cannot be ruled out for systems which are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2052P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
