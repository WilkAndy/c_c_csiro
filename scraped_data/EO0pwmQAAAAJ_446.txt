The enhanced capabilities of ATCA+ CABB should now allow us to detect the radio emission from the jet produced in quiescence, which we predict to have a flux density of a few 10s of microJy. This would be the second weakest jet ever measured from a black hole, and help to explore the poorly-understood behaviour of radiative and kinetic feedback from accretion at low accretion rates. It would further reinforce our radical idea that the kinetic luminosity of black holes accreting at low rates far exceeds the X-ray luminosity, ie the accretion flow is extremely radiatively inefficient. This has direct relevance for our understanding of the'fundamental plane of black hole activity', and for all black holes accreting at sub-Eddington rates, such as Sgr A*."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009atnf.prop.2048F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
