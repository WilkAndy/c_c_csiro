Recently, Lanzoni et al.(2007) reported evidence for an intermediate mass black hole in the globular cluster NGC 6388. If present, the object should produce radio emission. We propose to search for the predicted radio emission using ATCA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:sFh2DmJudxsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1657K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
