A wealth of information at radio, optical and X-ray wavelengths suggests that it may be a\" wild cousin\" of SN 1987A and that characteristics of SN 1987A are more common in supernovae than previously thought. SN 1996cr may have first expanded rapidly through a sparse circumstellar medium but then slowed down considerably when ploughing through a dense region left over from an earlier time in the evolution of the progenitor. We propose to determine the deceleration and provide crucial information for modelling the circumstellar medium. We will make an image to reveal the type of the supernova, shell or center filled, allow us to search for the stellar remnant of the explosion, reveal any complexity that could be related to optical-spectrum velocity components and resolve any ambiguity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:53CL4OiWbn0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1772B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
