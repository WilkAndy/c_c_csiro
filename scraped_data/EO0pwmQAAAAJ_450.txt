This will allow us to distinguish between a constant quiescent radio emission from the system and enhanced radio emission from a flare, associated with the formation of jets. We will also investigate any flaring activity and its evolution and determine how this relates to the reported quiescent emission. Such an intensive study has not been previously attempted for Cir X-1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:-Xpk-jsdKCIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1756T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
