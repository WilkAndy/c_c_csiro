We propose to observe it at 6 cm. We will measure or constrain flux variability in the core and lobes compared with previous 6-cm observations from 1992 and 1997; we will search for position and morphology changes in the lobes; we will compare the radio and X-ray state of the accreting black hole. Furthermore, we will model the lobe formation process, size and age, using our simulations of jet propagation in an inhomogeneous medium, with jet/cloud collisions. By estimating the jet power injected into the lobes, we will constrain the distribution of outgoing accretion power between radiative and kinetic energy (an important unsolved problem in black hole astrophysics at all scales)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1767S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
