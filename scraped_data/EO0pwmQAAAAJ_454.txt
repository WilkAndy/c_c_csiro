Beyond variability at the 16.55 day orbital period the source shows dramatic evolution of its X-ray luminosity, spectra and timing properties on timescales from milliseconds [23] to decades [22], alternating bright flares and periods of very low X-ray flux. The evidence that the system harbours a neutron star comes from the detection of type-I X-ray bursts [25] and twin kHz QPOs in the X-ray power density spectra [2]. The source is located in the Galactic plane at a distance that has been reported to lie in the range 4-12 kpc ([13],[14]). Cir X-1 is one of the most radio-loud neutron star X-ray binary ([28],[12]), showing extendedradio structures both at arcmin and arcsec scale. The arcmin-scale structure has been extensively studied ([24],[26]): the source shows two radio jets (south-east and north-west direction) embedded in a large scale, diffuse radio nebula. There is general agreement that this nebula is the result of the radio lobe inflated by the jets over several hundred-thousand years. Arcmin-scale jets are curved which might be due to an interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM) or a precessing jet. On arcsec scale, the source shows a one-sided highly-variable jet [6], the most relativistic one detected so far within our Galaxy [7], with a bulk Lorentz factor\u2265 10.
