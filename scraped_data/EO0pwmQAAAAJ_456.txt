Observations were made between 1200UT 1st May 2008 and 1600UT 3rd May 2008 at 4994MHz. No radio source was detected above 190 microJy/beam (3-sigma) within an area of radius 0.5 arcmin centred upon the reported position of the optical transient (Atel# 1501). This non-detection at radio wavelengths, along with the non-detection by Swift (Atel# 1503) and recent spectroscopic results (Atel# 1512) support the hypothesis that this transient is a classical nova in M82."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:j2GSQqY3pL0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ATel.1522....1A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
