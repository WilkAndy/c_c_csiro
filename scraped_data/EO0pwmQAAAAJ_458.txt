We have already guaranteed six nights of observing time using Chandra, VLT, APEX, IRAM and CSO. The proposed monitoring of the total and polarization intensity of Sgr A* at four frequencies between 44 and 86 GHz is critical to test the predictions of the expanding plasmon model of van der Laan. One motivation is to fit the total and polarization light curves of flare emission at multiple frequencies and to measure the physical parameters that characterize properties of expanding synchrotron blobs. The other is to search for time delay between radio, submm and near-IR/X-ray flares with aa time coverage using ATCA and APEX. The second motivation is to study the polarization of flare emission and to test the frequency-dependent rotation measure predicted from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1323Y/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
