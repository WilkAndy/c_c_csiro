Our primary goal for the entire campaign is to see if an individual AGN can be established to follow the radio: X-ray correlation-with slope+ 0.6-which has been established for X-ray binaries, and whose presence in AGN is implied by the recent discovery of'fundamental planes' of black hole activity. Currently no AGN has been established to show such a correlation, leaving a key piece of the arguments for scale-free'grand unification'of black holes of all masses untested. This is a unique opportunity to test this paradigm. Our results to date show a strong radio/X-ray correlation but with a significantly shorter lag than expected, so we speculate that we may be seeing beamed emission from the jet in a'mini-blazar'configuration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008atnf.prop.1609F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
