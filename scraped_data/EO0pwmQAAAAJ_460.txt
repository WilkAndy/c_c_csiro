Radio emission from the ensuing supernova remnant has been increasing rapidly over the last decade, as a result of the collision between the supernova shock and the progenitor's circumstellar medium. 9 GHz imaging observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array are able to spatially resolve the emission, and show an expanding limb-brightened shell structure. Here we present detailed spatial modeling of SN 1987A's radio morphology. We have developed an inclined torus model incorporating a light travel time correction, which we use to fit the interferometric visibilities of the source in the Fourier domain. This allows us to extract physical parameters at each epoch such as the radius of the shock, the torus geometry and the degree of asymmetry in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:FOZckGct7WUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AAS...21110017N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
