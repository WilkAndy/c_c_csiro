Parkes adds significantly to the strength of both the terrestrial and celestial solutions. Parkes is the only ATNF telescope equipped with the necessary concentric 2.3/8.4 GHz receivers, and after Hobart the only other available telescope in Australia; its large aperture provides high SNR observations which translate into improved presision. This proposal has three parallel objectives; to improve the terrestrial reference frame in Australia via additional geodetic VLBI observations, to use these additional observations to improve the quality and reliability of the positions of the celestial reference frame sources, and to determine the astrometric positional stability of the known southern scintillators. We ask for close co-ordination between the Parkes IVS/Goddard Space Flight Center schedulers in order to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:LyOydA3uxaIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1084T/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bcf_uxyUMGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
