The source has been known for a few years as the variable X-ray source, Circinus Galaxy X-2, but was only recently identified as a supernova, which is about 10 years old. Our primary goal is to determine the structure of the supernova: a shell with an empty center as seen in SN 1987A and SN 1993J, or a shell with a central compact source likely related to the stellar corpse, as seen in SN 1986J, or a different type. The multi-frequency synthesis observations will also serve as a test for anticipated space VLBI with RadioAstron. We plan to continue these observations to determine the expansion, deceleration and structure changes with time. SN 1996cr is the brightest radio supernova ever observed and the closest in the southern sky after SN 1987A and represents one of the rare \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:JNgBMBbBnUoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1091B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
