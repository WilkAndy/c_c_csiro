The source was initially detected in the radio-band during the optical rise. This was followed by a radio flare and continuous weak radio emission during all of the optical outburst. The behaviour is similar to that seen in X-ray binaries. Here, we propose to observe two nova-like CVs. Compared to a dwarf-nova a nova-like star is constantly in outburst. As the accretion rate is the major difference between those source classes, nova-like objects should be persistend radio emitters, which should be detected in a 12h ATCA observation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop.1021K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
