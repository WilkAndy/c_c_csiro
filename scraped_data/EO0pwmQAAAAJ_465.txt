On 2007 Aug 30 (MJD 54342.26) we performed optical observations of Aql X-1 for 100 sec each in V and i'filters using the Faulkes Telescope North in V and i'-bands and detected the source with a confidence of 20 and 63 sigma in V and i', respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:KIRwYnRZzWQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ATel.1218....1M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
