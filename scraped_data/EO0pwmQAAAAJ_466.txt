The detection of type I X-ray bursts [1, 2] and twin kHz quasi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray power spectra [3] strongly suggests that the compact object in the system is a neutron star. The system exhibits periodic flares (P~ 16.6 d) observed in X-ray [4], infrared [5, 6] and radio [7, 8] bands, which are interpreted as enhanced accretion near the periastron passage. Circinus X-1 is associated with an arcmin scale synchrotron nebula [9, 10] which is probably powered by the jet originating close to the binary system [11, 12]. The jet is observed in radio band at arcmin as well as arcsec scales and was recently tentatively detected in X-ray band by Chandra [13]. Moreover, observations at cm wavelengths offered evidence for the presence of a relativistic outflow aligned very close to the line of sight [14]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:kVDlchZkYg4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pos.sissa.it/056/014/pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ackofr9m7T4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
