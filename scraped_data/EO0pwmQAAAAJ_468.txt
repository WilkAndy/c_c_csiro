Previous ATCA observations revealed a rapidly evolving arcsec scale jet. Using the unique e-VLBI capabilities we intend to image the sub-arcsec structures. This will allow us to study the path of energy transportation from the core to the surrounding radio nebula and the radio/X-ray correlations in the system (RXTE simultaneous observations are planned). New constraints on the theoretical models of the source might be put forward."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lCdzyD0WTL4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..866F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
