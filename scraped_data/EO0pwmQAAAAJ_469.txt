However, much of the mass in the outflows may be tied up in the neutral ISM. We propose to test this idea by making deep HI 21cm observations of the nearby proto-quasar PKS1549-79 for which we have already found evidence for warm outflows based on optical emission lines. This will provide a key test of the AGN feedback models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..779M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
