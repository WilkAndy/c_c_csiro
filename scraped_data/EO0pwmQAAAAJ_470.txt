In this respect the candidate proto-quasar PKS1549-79 (z= 0.152) is a key object, showing many of the features predicted by the evolutionary models. However, our interpretation of PKS1549-79 is hampered by our lack understanding of its luminous, one-sided radio jet. Therefore we propose multi-epoch VLBI observations of PKS1549-79 in order to search for superluminal motions in its jet. The detection of superluminal motions will allow us to:(i) measure the jet angle to the line of sight;(ii) rule out alternative explanations for jet-sidedness in terms of jet-cloud interactions;(iii) develop a full geometrical model for the source and its outflows;(iv) estimate the instrinsic jet power."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007atnf.prop..909M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
