Simultaneous observations with the VLA and ATCA, combined with ATCA monitoring over several years, have revealed some properties of the turbulent ionized medium responsible for the ISS of PKS 1257-326. The scattering occurs in an unusually nearby (~10 pc), localized \"screen\". The scintillation pattern is highly anisotropic with axial ratio more than 10:1 elongated in a northwest direction on the sky. Recent findings and implications for small-scale ionized structures in the ISM are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:VsjxJ5V0Y48C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DuYoo_5MvhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
