These observations show that the radio source which appeared approximately two weeks after the initial X-ray outburst consisted of two prominent components which separated with an apparent speed of 1.5+ 0.4 c. When the various possibilities for the geometry of the radio source are taken into account the apparent speed implies an intrinsic speed between 0.5 c and 0.9 c. Our results and those of other investigators imply a strong link between the accretion of material onto a highly compact object and the ejection of relativistic components of radio emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4xcnnZsK8tIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fg_NCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA145&dq=info:_Rg_SElebO0J:scholar.google.com&ots=k-fmBY_qGz&sig=xhFjtic8yT01Z1Oh6fgeWcQD_vA", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_Rg_SElebO0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
