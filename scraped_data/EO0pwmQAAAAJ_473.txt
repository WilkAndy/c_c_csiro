In addition we present multi-epoch observations at a frequency of 8.4 GHz which show the complex evolution of the sub-parsec-scale morphology over a 3.3 year period. Subluminal motion is seen and structural changes observed on time-scales shorter than four months."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ooaom_WTAwIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fg_NCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:SjgNFi-ySmEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=k-fmBY_qGC&sig=9iKa2C_46riOq10fikfRVqEo7TE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SjgNFi-ySmEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
