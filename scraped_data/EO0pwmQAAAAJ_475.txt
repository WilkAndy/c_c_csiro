These results are part of an effort to increase the sky density of Southern Hemisphere sources with accurate positions in order to better define the ICRF and to provide additional phase-reference sources for use in astrophysical observations. The positions for all these sources are south of declination-20 degrees and they represent the largest group of new milliarcsecond accurate astrometric positions for sources in this declination range since the initial definition of the ICRF.
