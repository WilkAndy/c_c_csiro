The data were taken (almost) simultaneously in radio and X ray during a survey carried out in October 2000 and December 2002. Cir X-1 was observed at the radio frequencies of 4.8 and 8.6 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). In the X-ray spectral domain we used the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We found strong evidence for flaring activity in radio not only at the periastron but also at the apoastron passages. A comparison of our data against different correlations between radio and X ray found in other neutron star systems shows that Cir X-1 does not seem to follow the general trend. However, the fact that Cir X-1 is an `exotic' X-ray binary makes any interpretation more complicated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611713", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B8QJg6uk2P4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
