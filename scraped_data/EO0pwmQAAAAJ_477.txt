Inter-continental baselines resolve this source into a compact core and three jet components that move away from the core with proper motions ranging between \\~0.1 mas/yr for the outer jet component and ~1.4 mas/yr for the fastest inner jet component, i.e. apparent speeds of ~2.0 c to ~21.6 c respectively. This result is in contrast to previous studies of this source which did not reveal significant jet motions from limited data sets. We find that the fast inner jet components catch up to the more slowly moving outer jet components and interact strongly, causing local brightening of the jet in the interaction. We document the body of VLBI data for this source, as well as other supporting radio observations, as a basis for future work that will investigate the underlying physics of the pc-scale jet in PKS 0003-066."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:L1d--jQnBlAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SXeyEaHHKrgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
