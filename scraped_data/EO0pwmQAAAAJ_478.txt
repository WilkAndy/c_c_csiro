Its infrared and X-ray fluxes show a periodicity of 4.8 hours, being interpreted as the orbital period of the system. The nature of the compact object is not known (eg [2]), whereas the companion seems to be a WN Wolf-Rayet star (eg [3]). Radio observations at different resolutions were made during large flares, revealing the presence of relativistic jets in the system (eg [4, 5, 6])."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:s1ouQE5r0WUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guy-Pooley/publication/252434552_e-VLBI_observations_of_a_microquasar_in_outburst/links/0046353bc30637a79e000000/e-VLBI-observations-of-a-microquasar-in-outburst.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fb4CU_4rEDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
