Its quiescent spectra can be best fitted by a power-law with slope Gamma 2 as found previously. V404 Cyg was roughly equal in luminosity compared to the previous observation of Chandra with variability of a factor of 4 during the observation. We find no evidence for the presence of iron fluorescent emission, nor emission from more highly ionized states and discuss constraints this presents upon the accretion flow geometry. This research was supported by the XMM-Newton Guest Observer Program."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4tNoA7Af41QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006HEAD....9.0172B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
