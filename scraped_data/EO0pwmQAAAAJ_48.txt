Owing to the steeply falling atmospheric background spectrum, events at PeV energies most likely have an extraterrestrial origin. We present the multiwavelength properties of the six radio-brightest blazars that are positionally coincident with these events using contemporaneous data of the TANAMI blazar sample, including high-resolution images and spectral energy distributions. Assuming the X-ray to \u03b3-ray emission originates in the photoproduction of pions by accelerated protons, the integrated predicted neutrino luminosity of these sources is high enough to explain the two detected PeV events."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:aUOtug7Ojf8C", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7849750541808452124", "cites_id": ["7849750541808452124"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2014/06/aa24219-14/aa24219-14.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HELsK4fq72wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 10, "2015": 19, "2016": 11, "2017": 17, "2018": 16, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
