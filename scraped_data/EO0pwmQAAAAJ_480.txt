Most published work, however, has been based on non-simultaneous data spanning many years since its major outburst in 1989. We present the most complete spectral energy distribution of the source, primarily based on a coordinated and simultaneous multiwavelength campaign in 2003, but drawing in other available data. We will discuss the components detected in the binary in the context of models of the quiescent state, and crucially exploit time resolved data to discuss connections between them. This work was supported by awards from the Chandra and XMM-Newton GO programs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:s2G-WRnXBicC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006HEAD....9.0804H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
