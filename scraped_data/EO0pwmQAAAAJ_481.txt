It is used to study small scales structures, from the inner regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in distant galaxies and quasars, to stellar explosions such as X-ray binaries in our own galaxy. It also has helped to define and continues to improve the International Celestial reference Frame (ICRF).A review was given of current VLBI networks around the world and their capabilities. A lot of development is under way to upgrade these arrays to higher sensitivities and wide-field imaging. The fast networks that are becoming available are also facilitating e-VLBI, with the potential of world-wide real-time networks. A progress report of current developments and plans was presented."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.2348069", "cites_per_year": {}}
