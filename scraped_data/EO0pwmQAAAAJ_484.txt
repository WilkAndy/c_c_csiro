At the same time we probe small-scale structure in the local ionised interstellar medium of our own Galaxy. Previous observations in 2001-2003 have allowed us to measure the characteristic length scale and anisotropy of the scintillation pattern as well as the distance to the scattering medium. We find degenerate solutions for the scintillation velocity as a result of the large pattern anisotropy (axial ratio~ 10: 1). Measurement of the pattern arrival time delay between the VLA and ATCA around day of year 215 can break this degeneracy. This would allow us to accurately model the observed evolution of the multi-frequency, polarized microarcsecond-scale source structure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:zEEUHg7m05MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..299B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
