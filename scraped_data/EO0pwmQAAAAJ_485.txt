These observations are required to estimate the effect of source structure on positon, to investigate possible systematic errors in the reference frame positions, and to provide a strong tie between the Hemispheres through overlap of common sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:mYPvCrJ_kzAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..228O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
