We proposed sensitive 4.8 and 8.4 GHz observations to determine more precisely the flux densities and spectra of the core and the north and south hotspots, search for low-level jet emission, constrain the motion of the northern hotspot, and examine the core for evidence of variability. The 12-hour 4.8 GHz observation was made in March 2005, and we re-propose here for the matching 12-hour 8.4 GHz observation which is critical for studies of the strongly absorbed core."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006atnf.prop..251E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
