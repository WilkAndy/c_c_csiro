Measured rms noise levels are respectively 0.12, 0.10, 0.26, 0.25 mJy at 4.8 GHz and a factor about two lower at 8.6 GHz. When the 4 data sets are added together, this results in a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.14 mJy at 8.6 GHz and 0.30 mJy at 4.8 GHz."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yIh087D13zsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ATel..685....1G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
