The total size of the Australian astronomical community has remained essentially unchanged over the past decade. The areas of research effort have remained similar, with an increase in effort in theoretical and computational astrophysics. 2. Since the data for the 2005 survey has been collected differently, we are able to determine the sub-sample of the community who are in continuing appointments and spend some fraction of their time on research. This group is 25% of the entire community, with the researchers in tenured university appointments representing less than 15% of the community.3. Of the tenured staff only 10% are women, though this fraction increases to 20% for the entire community and to 37% for the current postgraduate cohort. 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:L7JqRCIhofwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15788855958458224799&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:n1C2XddIHdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
