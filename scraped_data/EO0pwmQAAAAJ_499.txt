We report observations of this radio source with the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The observations confirm the elongation and expansion already reported based on observations at lower angular resolutions, but suggest that at early epochs the structure is not consistent with the very simplest models such as Gaussian flux distributions. In particular there appears to be significant non-Gaussian structure on small angular scales, which may correspond to localised sites of particle acceleration during the early phases of expansion and interaction with the ambient medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nroGzMJTTpEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20050215643", "cites_per_year": {}}
