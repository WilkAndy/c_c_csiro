We find that the radio emission from the system is strongly correlated with the hard X-ray emission and is reduced by a factor of\u2265 25 during the high/soft state compared with the more usual low/hard state. At the points of state transition, we note brief periods of unusually optically thin radio emission that may correspond to discrete ejection events. We propose that in the low/hard state, black hole X-ray binaries produce a quasi-continuous outflow, that in the high/soft state, this outflow is suppressed, and that state transitions often result in one or more discrete ejection events. Future models for low/hard states, such as advection-dominated solutions, need to take into account the strong outflow of relativistic electrons from the system. We propose that the inferred \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TmI2AlsRohcC", "num_citations": 415, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13954951956059620569", "cites_id": ["13954951956059620569"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/312128/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2YSTFt7yqcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 13, "2001": 31, "2002": 23, "2003": 25, "2004": 21, "2005": 26, "2006": 21, "2007": 22, "2008": 20, "2009": 16, "2010": 18, "2011": 19, "2012": 20, "2013": 16, "2014": 12, "2015": 12, "2016": 19, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 16, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
