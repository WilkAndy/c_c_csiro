The power carried away by the jets, and, hence, the feedback they provide to their surroundings, depends strongly on their composition. Jets containing a baryonic component should carry significantly more energy than electron\u2013positron jets. Energetic considerations, and circular-polarization measurements have provided conflicting circumstantial evidence for the presence or absence of baryons in jets, and the only system in which they have been unequivocally detected is the peculiar X-ray binary SS\u2009433 (refs , ). Here we report the detection of Doppler-shifted X-ray emission lines from a more typical black-hole candidate X-ray binary, 4U\u20091630-47, coincident with the reappearance of radio emission from the jets of the source. We argue that these lines arise from baryonic matter in a jet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:f36TrmluGJsC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8973200097458078183", "cites_id": ["8973200097458078183"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12672", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:50F9U_I1h3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 23, "2015": 17, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 10, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
