Compared to activities in European and American regions, we did not have a body to manage radio frequency issues for radio astronomy in the Asia-Pacific region, and the requirement for such a body had been discussed for a long time. Because of the extremely high sensitivity of radio telescopes while the dense usage of frequencies in active services, the interference from active services has been becoming more and more serious for radio astronomy. A brief summary of the situation and activity is given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1422498/", "cites_per_year": {}}
