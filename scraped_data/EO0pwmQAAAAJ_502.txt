The X-ray flux varied dramatically by a factor of> 20 during a 60 ks observation. X-ray variations were well correlated with those in H\u03b1, although the latter include an approximately constant component as well. Correlations can also be seen with the optical continuum, although these are less clear. We see no large lag between X-ray and optical line variations; this implies they are causally connected on short timescales. As in previous observations, H\u03b1 flares exhibit a double-peaked profile suggesting emission distributed across the accretion disk. The peak separation is consistent with material extending outward to at least the circularization radius. The prompt response in the entire H\u03b1 line confirms that the line variability is powered by X-ray (and/or EUV) irradiation. The origin of the optical continuum variability, whether \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:jq04SsiGh3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004HEAD....8.4002H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
