Our last clear detection was on 20 July 2004, when the 4.86 GHz flux density remained steady at 2.0+/-0.2 mJy in two five-minute observations centered on 05: 06 and 08: 53 UT. Data taken at the same frequency on 23 July 2004 gave a nominal flux density at the position of the source of 0.27+/-0.09 mJy/beam, while 8.46 GHz observations on 23, 27, 28, 31 July, 1 August gave nominal flux densities of 0.09+/-0.05, 0.06+/-0.08, 0.05+/-0.04, 0.105+/-0.034, and 0.00+/-0.10 mJy/beam, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:1wZ_wKGpLuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ATel..315....1R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
