It will operate in the frequency range from~ 10 to 240 MHz, with a resolution at 240 MHz of better than an arcsecond. Its superb sensitivity will allow for a broad range of astrophysical studies. In this contribution we first discuss four major areas of astrophysical research in which LOFAR will undoubtedly make important contributions: reionisation, distant galaxies and AGNs, transient radio sources and cosmic rays. Subsequently, we will discuss the technical concept of the instrument and the status of the LOFAR project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6Zm5LS9gQ5UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=uYhpDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA69&dq=info:Qcl5nwcxXWUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=e4pOC5FvDa&sig=7z3a_q1aajKgPr8OVUvDjs1z6Qg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qcl5nwcxXWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
