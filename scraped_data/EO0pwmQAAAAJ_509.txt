The level of linear polarization from Cygnus X-1 at two frequencies (4.86 and 8.46 GHz) is significantly lower than from two other low/hard state sources. We attribute this discrepancy to Faraday depolarization in the ionised wind of the massive companion star."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:cOfwuRB03ygC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6617283721400009142&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tsEFGHxQ1VsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
