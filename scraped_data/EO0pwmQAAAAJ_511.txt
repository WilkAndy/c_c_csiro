This is the largest sample of southern quasars ever imaged with VLBI at this frequency and along with some well known objects contains many sources that have never before been observed at milliarcsecond resolution. We present observational results and discuss the insight they provide into knowledge of quasar morphology energetics and unification schemes. We also explore the relation between quasar structure and emission at other wavelengths."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:5MWWCdJses0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003IAUJD..18E..57O/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
