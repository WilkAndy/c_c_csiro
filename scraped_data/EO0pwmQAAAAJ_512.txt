Using Chandra observations made between 2000 June and 2002 June, we have obtained proper motion measurements for both jets, indicating that the jets were moving at relativistic velocities away from the black hole during this time period. These observations mark the first time that an X-ray jet proper motion measurement has been obtained for any accretion powered Galactic or extra-galactic source. The most likely scenario is that the eastern jet is the approaching jet and that the jet material was ejected from the black hole in 1998. Combining the Chandra observations with previous results from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio measurements of the jets in 1998 allows us to study the full 4 year life-cycle of the eastern jet. We directly measure the gradual deceleration of this jet, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:pKq9KLJfUZEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AAS...201.5704T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
