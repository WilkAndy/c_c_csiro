Triggered by the discovery of large-scale jet emission in the radio from the microquasar XTE J1550-564, multiple Chandra images of the jets provide a unique opportunity to study the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets on time scales inaccessible for active galactic nuclei jets. The broad band spectrum of the jets is consistent with synchrotron emission from particles accelerated up to 10 TeV. The morphology of the radio and X-ray emission is suggestive of interaction of the jets with the interstellar medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:AU_EAA-G7qsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002xrb..confE..18K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
