Comparison of the lightcurve morphologies, spectral behaviour, properties of the QPOs and the radio jet provides the first study of such objects as a subclass of X-ray transients (XRTs). However, rather than assuming that these hard state XRTs are different from ``canonical'' soft XRTs, we prefer to consider the possibility that a new analysis of both soft and hard state XRTs in a spectral context will provide a model capable of explaining the outburst mechanisms for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:dFKc6_kCK1wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207386", "cites_per_year": {}}
