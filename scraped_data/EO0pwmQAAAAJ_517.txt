We estimated the optical depth and the event rate of the position wander of the extragalactic radio sources nearby Sgr A* and found that such position wander degrades the measurement of trigonometric parallax of Sgr A* significantly. The probability of the degradation of 10 \u03bcas is a few tens of percent, and that of 25 \u03bcas is a few percent. Several years' continuous observation is needed for the separation of this gravitational position wander from the annual parallactic motion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:MagRZZew-58C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002aprm.conf..479H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w_rH7NtsDNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
