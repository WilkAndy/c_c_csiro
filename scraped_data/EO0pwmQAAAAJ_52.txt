On 2002 March 11, X-ray emission was detected 23 &arcsec; to the west of the black hole candidate and was extended along the jet axis with an FWHM of 1 &farcs; 2 and a full width at 10% of maximum intensity of 5 &arcsec;. The morphology of the X-ray emission matched well to that of the radio emission at the same epoch. The jet moved by 0 &farcs; 52\u00b10 &farcs; 13 between 2002 March 11 and June 19. The apparent speed during that interval was 5.2\u00b11.3 mas day-1. This is significantly less than the average apparent speed of 18.1\u00b10.4 mas day-1 from 1998 to 2002, assuming that the jet was ejected in 1998 September, and indicates that the jet has decelerated. The X-ray spectrum is adequately described by a power law \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:FjmlLC3huY4C", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16295356939557622053", "cites_id": ["16295356939557622053"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/344540/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JVGHzsy8JOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 8, "2004": 11, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 9, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
