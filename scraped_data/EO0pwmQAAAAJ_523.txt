While ISS reduces the implied brightness temperatures, they remain uncomfortably high. The distance to the scattering screen is an important parameter in determining the actual brightness temperature encountered. The high brightness temperatures, the presence of strong and variable circular polarization and the observed lifetimes of a decade or more for several IDV sources, pose significant problems for synchrotron theory.     \u201cThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.\u201d William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:R4LAE1HziJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/intraday-variability-and-microarcsecond-structure-in-blazar-cores/E7387DB1D7D9FF0B14D1182EFE74FC5E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s1oAQF8Y5YUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
