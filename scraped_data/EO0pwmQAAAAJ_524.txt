The power required to drive this radio emission is enormous (~ 50% of accretion luminosity). Atoll sources are observationally similar in many ways to BHCs. Physically this may result from a comparable population of energetic electrons. As a result two processes occur, Comptonisation, leading to the high-energy X-rays observed, and synchrotron emission, observable at radio wavelengths. After our succesfull RXTE/VLA campain on 4U 1728-34 in AO5 we propose correlated RXTE/VLA observations of both 4U 1728-34 and 4U 1820-30 designed to disentangle the X-ray/radio connections."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:SPgmg5JLkoEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001rxte.prop60029F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
