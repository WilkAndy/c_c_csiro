During this flaring state there was an extended period (over 21 days) of quenched radio emission (low hard X-ray/high soft X-ray state) which was followed by two major radio flares (13.5 and 17 Jy). Throughout this activity an extensive multiwavelength campaign was undertaken. These included observations in the hard X-ray (CGRO/BATSE), X-ray (RXTE/ASM/PCA/HEXTE), radio (GBI, Ryle Telescope, VLA, RATAN-600), radio imaging (VLBA), and high resolution X-ray spectroscopy and imaging (Chandra). The Chandra observations will be presented in the context of this multiwavelength campaign. Preliminary analysis of the Chandra observations show a very rich line spectrum. Compared to a previous Chandra observation made during the radio quiescent state the continuum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:E8ajGqO0XoUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000HEAD....5.2805M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
