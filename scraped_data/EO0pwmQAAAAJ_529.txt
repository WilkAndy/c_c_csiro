VSOP \nObservations of PSR B0329+54 ANTHONY MINTER NRA 0, PO Box 2, Green Bank, West \nVirginia, USA 1 Introduction The pulsar B0329+54 was observed on 22 August 1998 using \nthe HALCA satellite, the VLBA, the 140 foot telescope in Green Bank and the DSN's 70 \nmeter telescopes in Goldstone and Madrid. The observations where at 1634 to 1666 MHz \nwith 64 channels in two IFs resulting in a spectral resolution of 0.5 MHz. The VSOP \nobservations were performed from 06:00 to 18:00 UT on August 22, 1998. These \nobservations used the Green Bank, Goldstone, Madrid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:IuYOVjjUQBMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/record/conf/aprs./2000/2000aprs.conf..113M.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
