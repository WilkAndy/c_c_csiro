Our astrometric analysis results in the precise determination of the kinematics of this star, which reveals an orbital motion readily explained as caused by gravitational interaction with a low-mass companion. From the portion of the reflex orbit covered by our data and using a revised mass of the primary star (0.76 M &sun;) derived from our new value of the parallax (66.3 mas< \u03c0< 67.2 mas), we find the dynamical mass of the newly discovered companion to be between 0.08 and 0.11 M &sun;. If accurate photometric information can be obtained for the low-mass companion, our precise mass estimate could serve as an accurate calibration point for different theoretical evolutionary models of low-mass objects.
