The scientific goals will be analysis of cosmic ray data from the Japanese-American Cooperative Emulsion Experiments (JACEE). Measurements of primary cosmic rays in the JACEE emulsion chambers will be made to derive for each detected particle the deposited energy in the chamber and the primary charge (atomic number). The data will be corrected to the primary flux above the atmosphere, and the composition and energy spectra will be derived. The spectra of the individual elements will be interpreted in context with the supernova shock and other models of cosmic ray acceleration. Additional information is contained in the original extended abstract."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:vjZqxyZ7hS4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20010094540", "cites_per_year": {}}
