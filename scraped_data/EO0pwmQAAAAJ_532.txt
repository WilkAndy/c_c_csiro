We estimate the effect on position and find that such effects may degrade the measurement of trigonometric parallax of Sgr A*. To separate this gravitational deflection from annual parallactic motion, several years of continuous observation is needed. Such observation also tell us the density and the mass function of nuclear bulge stars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:cKQgJgBA5EIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000IAUJD...2E..10F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
