Thanks to its selection criteria (S2. 7GHz> 2 Jy, z< 0.7, 8< 10), the sample includes radio sources of different classes, ie FRIS, FRIL, CSS, compact flat spectrum sources and core-halo sources. Furthermore the sample is studied in a wide range of bands, from radio (Morganti et al. 1993 and 1999), to optical (Tadhunter et al. 1993), up to X-ray energies (Siebert et al. 1996). This allows comparative studies, which are crucial to understand the physics of the inner parsec-scale regions in AGN, to test unified models and evolutionary scenarios for radio galaxies.From the 2-Jy sample we selected six radio galaxies lacking information on their parsec-scale morphology and with arcsecond core flux density S5GHz> 200 mJy, and observed them with different VLBI arrays (ie EVN+ MERLIN, LBA, VLBA) in different bands (18, 13 and 6 cm). The selected objects are 3C17, PKS 0620-52, PKS 0625-35, PKS 1318\u201343, PKS 1333\u201333 and 3C317. The first is an intermediate FRI/FRII object, while all the others are FRIs located in optically dense environments. In particular, 3C317 is associated with the cD galaxy UGC 9799, at the centre of the cooling flow cluster A2052. This source was extensively studied at arcsecond resolution by Zhao et al.(1993) Details on the observations and data reduction can be found in Venturi et al.(2000)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7DTIKO_nxaIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8416560688913644347&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O_s2jVqhzXQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
