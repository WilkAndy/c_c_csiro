Relativistic parsec-scale jets are common both in FRI and FRII radio galaxies, and their orientation to the line of sight is in agreement with the expectations from the unified schemes for radio loud AGNs. Proper motion has been detected in a few FRI galaxies in the sample. FRI and FRII radio galaxies exhibit very similar properties on the parsec-scale. Finally a few radio sources in the sample show evidence of velocity structure in the parsec-scale jet, ie a central spine with high Lorentz factor \u03b3 and slower layers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:EvHYAMKeY9cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000evn..conf...47V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
