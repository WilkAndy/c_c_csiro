We have applied Gaussian profile fits and tomographic modeling to the full phase coverage spectra to make the most accurate comparison of line profile variations matched against the X-ray phase of the system. The June 1996 quiescent data reveal the He II and NV emission features to show maximum blue shift at \u03c6 x= 0.00+/-0.04, relative to the x-ray minimum. There is no significant difference in \u03c6 x between the HeII or NV lines seen during the quiescent phase. The July 1997 outburst data show a moderately strong P Cygni-like profile developed in the He I 2.058 \u03bc m singlet, providing the first absorption feature ever to be traced through an entire 4.8 hr orbital period of the system. The orbital phasing of this feature shows maximum blue shift \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:5VjbC5aozO0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AAS...195.3906H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
