Most of these sources are being monitored as part of a multiwavelength campaign from X-Ray to radio wavelengths. The sources in the northern hemisphere have been monitored in the radio by Medicina for the past 2 years at 5 & 3 cm. The southern sources have been monitored over the last year using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 21, 13, 6 & 3 cm. The ATCA provides both flux density and polarization measurements. We will present preliminary results from this radio monitoring programme."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999ASPC..159...71B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JOvevliBAEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
