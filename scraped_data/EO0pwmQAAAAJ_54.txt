These time delays confirm interstellar scintillation as the mechanism responsible for the rapid variability, at the same time effectively ruling out the coexistence of intrinsic intrahour variability in this source. The time delays are combined with measurements of the annual variation in variability timescale exhibited by this source to determine the characteristic length scale and anisotropy of the quasar's intensity-scintillation pattern, as well as to attempt to fit for the bulk velocity of the scattering plasma responsible for the scintillation. We find evidence for anisotropic scattering and highly elongated scintillation patterns at both 4.9 and 8.5 GHz, with an axial ratio> 10: 1, extended in a northwest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:btULBOGQ_gcC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16917647941287685331", "cites_id": ["16917647941287685331"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/508406/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0yySRyuPx-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 15, "2008": 8, "2009": 13, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3}}
