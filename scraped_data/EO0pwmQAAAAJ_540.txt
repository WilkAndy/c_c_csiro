In sensitive experiments at 8.4 GHz which use both arrays together we have detected components in a sub-parsec-scale counterjet. The counterjet is also seen in 2.3 and 22 GHz images. The nuclear region appears to be partially obscured by a free-free absorbing structure of about 1 pc in extent. The jet axis appears to lie at a 50\u00b0\u201370\u00b0 angle to our line of sight."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:sK9NQJKSZRcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/counterjet-in-the-nucleus-of-centaurus-a/8BEAB70C0658BECE39E459319ED86D30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jdWoLIKxRv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
