Our sample contains 165 new blazar candidates and 95 previously known blazars. As single-dish surveys yield positions no better than those produced by ROSAT (error circles 10\"-1'), we used ongoing VLA surveys (FIRST, Becker et al. 1995; NVSS, Condon et al. 1996) to refine the positions to the arcsecond level for sources north of-15. For southern (S<-15) sources, which also lacked spectral index information, we have done a survey at 6 cm and 3.6 cm with the ATCA. We then obtained finder charts using the Digitized Sky Survey. Where there is no candidate at the best position, a deeper image is being obtained at a 1m class telescope. Because of its depth and breadth (Figure 1), the WARPS blazar survey will yield the very first X-ray selected sample of FRSQs, allowing their X-ray luminosity function to be computed for the first time. This will produce constraints on the opening angle and 7 of the X-ray jet, parameters which are currently unconstrained. We will also address the current controversy"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:G9rRreC9Hv4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5462479437176140242&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0nHCTRugzksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
