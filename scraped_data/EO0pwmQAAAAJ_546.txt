The mass of the new object is near the hydrogen burning limit and will constitute a precise point for calibrating the low end of the main sequence. This represents the first detection of a low-mass stellar companion using the VLBI technique, which could become an important tool in future searches for planets and brown dwarfs orbiting other stars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:3u3nxgfnd-AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/evidence-of-a-lowmass-companion-to-ab-doradus/90A012A9FEC33800B0B30B269ED06093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fg9YWam5FksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
