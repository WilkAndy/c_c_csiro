Using our data as well as data obtained from the literature we have examined the difference in radio properties between gamma-ray loud and gamma-ray quiet radio sources. In particular, we find no evidence that gamma-ray loud radio sources lie preferentially in sources with straight radio jets as has been suggested."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4lQXLuH3RfAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/vlbi-of-southern-egret-identifications/A6F7A4223BADCB12D7214680D0D8A903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bbO4UvNjvEUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
