Here, we report the first detection with the Herschel observatory of a variable far-infrared source associated with the compact jets of the black hole transient GX 339\u22124 during the decay of its recent 2010\u20132011 outburst, after the transition to the hard state. We also outline the results of very sensitive radio observations conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, along with a series of near-infrared, optical (OIR) and X-ray observations, allowing for the first time the re-ignition of the compact jets to be observed over a wide range of wavelengths. The compact jets first turn on at radio frequencies with an optically thin spectrum that later evolves to an optically thick synchrotron emission. An OIR reflare is observed about 10\u2009d after the onset of radio and hard X-ray emission, likely reflecting the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:nazVBdFzvK0C", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12448240299264693036", "cites_id": ["12448240299264693036"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/431/1/L107/1410690", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LNNfPJkIwawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 9, "2014": 14, "2015": 12, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 15, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
