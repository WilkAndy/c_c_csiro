We are searching for radio wavelength properties on parsec-scales which can distinguish between gamma-ray loud and gamma-ray quiet AGN. Such properties might include relativistic beaming indicators such as parsec-scale jet proper motions and radio core brightness temperatures, as well as parsec-scale to kiloparsec-scale jet bend angles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:kMwF0kOiZPMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.54055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:akP3NAXJBGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
