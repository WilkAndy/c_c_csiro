Detection sensitivities of under 1 mJy were achieved for each of the 91 fields observed at 6-and 3-cm wavelength. The sources were selected from the van Paradijs (1995) catalogue. Eight objects were detected within the inner imaged field at flux densities of a few mJy. A further 9 detections of objects further than 1 arcmin from the field centres were also detected."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:lsEYeSe2tpEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9MTbtJJ0vycC&oi=fnd&pg=PA46&dq=info:TKcaiu4wrjIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=g3--u6EC8m&sig=Lvz_iV8bTzizws4doW7pB0jTpag", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TKcaiu4wrjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
