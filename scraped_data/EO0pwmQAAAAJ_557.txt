Our radio radio images reveal two components moving away from each other at an angular speed of 65\u00b15 mas/day, corresponding to superluminal motion (\u03c5/c = 1.4 \u00b1 0.4) at the estimated distance of 3\u20135 kpc. The 12-day delay between the X-ray and radio outbursts suggests that the ejection of material at relativistic speeds occurs during a stable phase of accretion onto a black hole, which follows an unstable phase with a high accretion rate. A complete description and discussion of these observations can be found in Tingay et al 1995 (Nature, 374, pp 141\u2013143)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:wNiDLpJVIZAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-astronomical-union-colloquium/article/southern-hemisphere-vlbi-observations-of-the-expansion-of-gro-j165540/75614A29FE097CC681D3C3F4E6306D5D", "cites_per_year": {}}
