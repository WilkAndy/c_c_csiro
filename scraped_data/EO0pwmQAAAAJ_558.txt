Our astrometric analysis results in the precise determination of the kinematics of this star, that reveals an orbital motion readily explained as caused by the gravitational interaction with a low-mass companion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:bsCEZ5n1K3cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/22401", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UhLISGrjCToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
