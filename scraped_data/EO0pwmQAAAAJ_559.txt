This source was designated GRO J1655-40. Approximately 12 days after the start of the X-ray outburst, a strong outburst of radio emission occurred. Here we present very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of GRO J1655-40 made with an array of telescopes in Australia, South Africa, and the western United States. These observations show that the radio source which appeared two weeks after the initial X-ray outburst consisted of two prominent components which separated with an apparent speed of 1.5 \u00b1 0.4c. When the various possibilities for the geometry of the radio source are taken into account the apparent speed implies an intrinsic speed between 0.5c and 0.9c.
