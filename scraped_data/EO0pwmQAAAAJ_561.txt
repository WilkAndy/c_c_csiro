Seven CSS sources (linear dimensions< 30kpc for H.= 50 kms-Mpc-1 and a> 0.5, S~ v-a) have been found in a complete sample of strong southern radio sources. This group of CSS sources is particularly interesting because some optical and X-ray information is already available as part of a more general study of southern radio sources (Morganti et al. & Siebert et al. these Proceedings). The spectra of all the sources were presented in Tad-hunter et al.(1993, MNRAS, 263, 999.) Here we present VLBI observations for three of these sources (0252-71, 1306-09 and 1814-63). The remaining four have already been imaged with VLBI (King et al. these Proceedings).Results and Discussion: The images obtained by observations at 2.3 GHz from the Southern Hemisphere MKII VLBI network (SHEVE) are shown in Figure 1. For 1306-095 and 1814-637 less than half of the total flux"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:DG0Btp6lGL8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7791618592786125336&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
