We have obtained 22 GHz VLBA data on this source to determine the intrinsic angular sizes of the compact components. Previous VLBI observations at lower frequencies indicate that the brightness temperatures of these components are signif-icantly lower than 1010 K (Jauncey et al. 1991), less than is typical for compact synchrotron radio sources and less than is implied by flux density variations. A possible explanation is that interstellar scattering is broad-ening the apparent angular size of the source and thereby reducing the observed brightness temperature. Our VLBA data support this hypothesis.The position of PKS 1830-211 is only a few degrees away from the galactic center (b=-5.7, 1= 12.2). It is therefore plausible that significant interstellar scattering (ISS) within our galaxy may occur along this line of sight. The effects of ISS decrease rapidly with frequency, and should be"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:9djSGow2EaoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17671400090871119439&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
