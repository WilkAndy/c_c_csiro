The evolution can be divided into two phases: the initial radio outburst which lasted a few weeks, and the period from mid-1990 to the present, during which the radio emission has steadily increased. Both phases can be explained by a small fraction (0.1-0.5%) of the post-shock thermal energy being converted to energy in relativistic particles and magnetic fields, which give rise to synchrotron radiation. The optical depths, densities and density profiles for the pre-shocked circumstellar material are somewhat different for the two phases, but consistent with models of the density structure of the material within the circumstellar ring. New high-resolution radio observations show that the SN shock front is already at about three-quarters of the radius of the circumstellar ring, and that there exists a bright equatorial component of emission aligned with this ring which is probably due to a polar density gradient in the'hourglass' structure."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:aMQnNzTHVu4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=kU2DgCQtp_cC&oi=fnd&pg=PA309&dq=info:c0dkqCBKin4J:scholar.google.com&ots=negH3R4g_R&sig=Z_mYS6_fzSK8nOFkx-yy1-zIAdc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c0dkqCBKin4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
