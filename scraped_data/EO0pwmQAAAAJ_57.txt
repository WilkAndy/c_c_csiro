We report the discovery of a radio nebula associated with the ULX IC 342 X-1 using the Very Large Array (VLA). Complementary VLA observations of the nebula around Holmberg II X-1, and high-frequency Australia Telescope Compact Array and Very Large Telescope spectroscopic observations of NGC 5408 X-1 are also presented. We study the morphology, ionization processes, and the energetics of the optical/radio nebulae of IC 342 X-1, Holmberg II X-1, and NGC 5408 X-1. The energetics of the optical nebula of IC 342 X-1 is discussed in the framework of standard bubble theory. The total energy content of the optical nebula is 6\u00d7 10 52 erg. The minimum energy needed to supply the associated radio nebula is 9.2\u00d7 10 50 erg. In addition, we detected an unresolved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:6biGW3np0psC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12626339518838809953", "cites_id": ["12626339518838809953"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/749/1/17/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YSXdKeXEOa8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 3, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 6}}
