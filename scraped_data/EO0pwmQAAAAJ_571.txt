The observations were madewith asouthern hemisphere arrayofradiotelescopes and theVLBA over a period of 4.5 yr at a frequency of 8.4 GHz. During this period complicated and short time-scale changes were seen in the sub-parsecscalestructureofthejet, including thedisappearance andreappearanceof strong components of emission. These changes could be indirect evidence for an underlying jet ow speed which is much higher than indicated by the observation of jet components with subluminal linear speeds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:n94QCav8jycC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15702054495576509069&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jcqp5F7n6NkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
