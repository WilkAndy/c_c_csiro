In addition we present multi-epoch observations at a frequency of 8.4 GHz which show the complex evolution of the sub-parsec-scale morphology over a 3.3 year period. Subluminal motion is seen and structural changes observed on time-scales shorter than four months."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Fp1gVP7Oym8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0102615", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V6p1ZVPHuJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
