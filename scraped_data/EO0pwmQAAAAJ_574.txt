The brightest known radio Einstein ring/gravitational lens PKS 1830-211, whilst obscured by our galaxy at optical wavelengths, has recently provided a lensing galaxy redshift of 0.89 through the detection of a new absorption feature, most likely due to neutral hydrogen in a second redshift system at z=0.19."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7eciy3tyNvQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/handle/2014/25256", "cites_per_year": {}}
