These observations show that the radio source which appeared approximately two weeks after the initial X-ray outburst consisted of two prominent components which separated with an apparent speed of 1.5 4-0.4 c. When the various possibilities for the geometry of the radio source are taken into account the apparent speed implies an intrinsic speed between 0.5 c and 0.9 c. Our results and those of other investigators imply a strong link between the accretion of material onto a highly compact object and the ejection of relativistic components of radio emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:mVcUxdmZzz4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BFb0102591.pdf#page=155", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VvT1nV0h20gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
