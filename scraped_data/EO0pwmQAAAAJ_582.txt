As such it is a very important target for observations of the small-scale (sub-parsec) and large-scale (kpc) structures in extragalactic jets. Here we present Mk-II VLBI observations made at 8.4 GHz over a 4.3 year period from early 1991 until mid-1995, as well as a 4.8 GHz observation that was co-eval with one of the 8.4 GHz observations. All of the observations were made with the SHEVE array except for the last observation which was made with the VLBA. The dual-frequency observations identify the core of the radio source, while the multi-epoch observations show the complex structural evolution at a resolution of 0.1 pc. Subluminal motion of \u2248 0.15c is evident. Structural changes are observed on time scales shorter than four months."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:pNwUjlbgJN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-0295-4_7", "cites_per_year": {}}
