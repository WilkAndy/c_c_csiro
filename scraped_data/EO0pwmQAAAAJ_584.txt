A sample of 23 extragalactic radio sources were observed. Images of 20 sources and structural information on 2 others (1548+ 056 and 1814-637) were obtained. Of the 20 sources, fifteen showed core-jet structure (0048-097, 0106+ 013, 0235+ 164, 0420-014, 0458-020, 1104-445, 1334-127, 1504-166, 1730-130, 1741-038, 1921-293, 2134+ 004, 2145+ 067, 2223-052, and 2345-167), one had a two-sided jet (1510-089) and 4 were unresolved at the level of~ 0.6 mas (0104-408, 1144-379, 1519-273 and 2216-038). There were no compact doubles. Eleven of the 16 core-jet (including the two-sided jet) sources showed evidence of bent jets. We also found evidence, based on the temporal variability of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:crhHmGRhyBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995AAS...186.0802S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
