During the subsequent radio outburst we completed VLBI synthesis imaging observations at a frequency of 2.29 GHz. An unprecedented angular motion of 65+/-5 mas day was observed between two components of complex and disparate morphology, or equivalently, an apparent transverse motion of 1.3 c+/-(0.7 c} _ {0.6 c) using the likely distance range of 3.5+/-1.5\\: kpc as inferred from HI absorption measurements. This separation rate indicates that the two components were at zero separation near the onset of the radio flare. Similar to the recently reported GRS 1915+ 105 it seems that the motion of material ejected from a stellar mass compact object with at least a mildly relativistic velocity may explain the observed radio structural changes in GRO J1655-40.
