These outer rings have been imaged from the ground, but never before seen with HST's resolution. The images show that the outer loops are two unresolved complete elliptical or circular rings, and apparently are not the limb brightened hourglass that had been previously supposed. An axisymmetric limb brightened thin emitting shell would have a brightness profile that falls inversely with the square root of the distance from the edge convolved with the instrumental profile. These images show essentially no emission within the ellipses. If the observed ellipses originate from luminous material located in planes parallel to the plane of the inner ring (inclined at 43 (deg) to the line of sight), then their deprojected shape \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:LqrXEw5M15gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994AAS...184.6602B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
