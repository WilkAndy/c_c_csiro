SAO/NASA ADS Astronomy Abstract Service 177th AAS MEETING, PHILADELPHIA, \nPENNSYLVANIA 1 19~ difference in radio lag times between line-rich and line-poor blazars, \nwith line-poor blazars having lag times shorter than 100 days and the two line-rich blazars \nhaving longer lag times of about 200 days. The nature of the processes producing the optical \nand r&Iio emission was also investigated. Optical variations for all the blazars were \ndominated by flicker noise independent of type. The radio variations were flicker noise mixed \nwith shot noise, although there may be a qualitative difference in,the radio region depending \non the type of blazar, with ificker noise dominating the line-poor blazars but shot noise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:RO_jAx7SIW8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/record/seri/BAAS./0022/1990BAAS...22.1195J.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
