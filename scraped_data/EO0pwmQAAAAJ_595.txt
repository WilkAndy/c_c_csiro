The source was found to be double with a component separation of 420+ 0.2 mas (84h T\" pc for H,= 100h km sT\" Mpc\"), a position angle of 905\"--1\", and compo-nent sizes of about 2.5 mas. Comparison with single-baseline data taken 12 yr earlier (Gubbay et al. 1971) shows no evidence for any significant change in structure within the reported errors, which places a limit of 0.05 c+ 0.2 c on the expansion velocity. About 40% of the total flux density is seen only on the shorter baselines and is modeled as an additional elongated component aligned with and between the compact double components. The source's almost equal compact double structure, peaked spectrum, low variability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:pWGfWVkwqDsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G-Nicolson/publication/258976171_VLBI_observations_at_23_GHz_of_the_compact_galaxy_1934-638/links/5526cc790cf2e486ae40c7e7/VLBI-observations-at-23-GHz-of-the-compact-galaxy-1934-638.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NzIqU20iQ1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
