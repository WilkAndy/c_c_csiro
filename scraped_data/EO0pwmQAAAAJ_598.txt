The sample is being used to map the space distribution of radio quasars and to determine their luminosity function. Accurate positions are being measured for a selection of the brighter quasars in order to establish an extragalactic position reference frame in the Southern Hemisphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:4Bh_hC5jS3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/mapping-the-radio-sky-compact-radio-quasars-from-the-parkes-27-ghz-survey/05F98DCDAF3992B39CC08CECAC92068A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4je_o_F8FRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
