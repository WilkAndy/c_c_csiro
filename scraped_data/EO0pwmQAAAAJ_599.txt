Observations were undertaken at 2.29 GHz with all five antennas, while only two were operational at 8.42 GHz. The 2.29 GHz data yielded significant information on the structure of the nuclear jet. At 8.42 GHz a compact unresolved core was detected as well."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ocFeo90gyj0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/symposium-international-astronomical-union/article/high-resolution-structure-of-the-centaurus-a-nucleus-at-229-ghz-and-842-ghz/BEA32490B7909939A93C27CCE84E959B", "cites_per_year": {}}
