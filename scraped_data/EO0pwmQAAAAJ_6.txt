The maser emission traces a warped, edge-on accretion disk between radii of 0.11\u00b10.02 and\u223c 0.40 pc, as well as a wide-angle outflow that extends up to\u223c 1 pc from the estimated disk center. The disk rotation is close to Keplerian (v\u221d r-0.5), the maximum detected rotation speed is 260 km s-1, and the inferred central mass is (1.7\u00b10.3)\u00d7 10 6 M\u2299. The outflowing masers are irregularly distributed above and below the disk, with relative outflow velocities up to\u223c\u00b1160 km s-1, projected along the line of sight. The flow probably originates closer than 0.1 pc to the central engine, possibly in an inward extension of the accretion disk, although there is only weak evidence of rotation in the outward-moving material. We observe that the warp \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:IjbvboqL_eAC", "num_citations": 360, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17150544963514870805", "cites_id": ["17150544963514870805"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/374862/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FSyr3sb5Au4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 19, "2005": 18, "2006": 16, "2007": 20, "2008": 23, "2009": 26, "2010": 13, "2011": 16, "2012": 24, "2013": 22, "2014": 17, "2015": 14, "2016": 23, "2017": 10, "2018": 17, "2019": 17, "2020": 11, "2021": 22, "2022": 15, "2023": 14}}
