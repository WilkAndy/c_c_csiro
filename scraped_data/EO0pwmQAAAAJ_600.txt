Observations were made at 2.3 and 8.4 Ghz. This array produced VLBI images of 28 southern hemisphere radio sources, high accuracy VLBI geodesy between southern hemisphere sites, and sub-arcsecond radio astrometry of celestial sources south of declination-45 degrees. This paper discusses only the astrophysical aspects of the experiment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:a67U_wXq1t0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1988IAUS..129..139P", "cites_per_year": {}}
