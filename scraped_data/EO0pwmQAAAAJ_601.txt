Trends in the properties of the complete sample are discussed.  All sources of special interest and 19 of the sources in the complete sample were observed with the Southern Hemisphere VLBI Experiment (SHEVE). This was the \ufb01rst extensive VLBI array in the southern hemisphere and its characteristics are presented in some detail. The data reduction methods and, in particular, the calibration of the large SHEVE dataset are described as this is critical to the quality of the \ufb01nal images. The imaging techniques are illustrated by detailed imaging of the radio source 1934-638. Since few closure phase and closure amplitude relations are present self\u2014calibration methods cannot be employed. It was found that the appropriate imaging method for the SHEVE data was model\ufb01tting with Gaussian components. A detailed image of 1934\u2014638 is presented and the source structure compared with previous VLBI observations. All sources observed in SHEVE were \ufb01tted with Gaussian component models. The models are presented in a table and source images shown to illustrate the source structure. The SHEVE data and the \ufb01ts of the models are also shown.  All sources in the complete sample and six of the additional VLBI sources were mapped at low resolution using the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) at 843 MHz and the Fleurs Synthesis Telescope at 1415 MHz. Special techniques were used at both instruments to gain direct access to the higher spatial frequency data and hence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/25997", "cites_per_year": {}}
