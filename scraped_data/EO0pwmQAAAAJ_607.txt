For a source to exhibit interstellar scintillation it must contain a component compara-ble to the angular size of the first Fresnel zone; for reasonable scattering screen distances, this implies microarcsecond component sizes. The presence of interstellar scintillation thus makes it possible to probe the struc-ture of scintillating sources with microarcsecond resolution, far higher than is currently achieved with ground or space VLBI. The presence of interstellar scintillation has significant implications for VLBI astronomy, astrometry, and geodesy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:W5d1EEiaRJMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucyna-Kedziora-Chudczer/publication/234549810_Beyond_VLBI_Interstellar_Scintillation_and_Microarcsecond_Radio_Source_Structure/links/02bfe51139294a76b4000000/Beyond-VLBI-Interstellar-Scintillation-and-Microarcsecond-Radio-Source-Structure.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gBYwCaSCkGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
