The additional PAF system is for use on the Effelsberg 100m diameter single-dish radio telescope in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany. ASKAP is a new 36-antenna aperture synthesis imaging radio telescope array being built by the CSIRO in a remote and radio quiet area of Western Australia [1]. ASKAP introduces a new approach in radio astronomy: the use of phased arrays at the focus of each dish antenna in the telescope array, rather than the conventional single feed element. The PAF permits multiple beams to be formed on the sky simultaneously at each antenna resulting in a dramatic increase in the instantaneous Field-of-View (FoV) of the telescope [2]. The beams can overlap, which allows continuous FoV to be formed. The large FoV advantages of the PAF system translate directly to the single-dish application, however one of the key architectural changes from ASKAP to the single-dish configuration for MPIfR was the replacement of the FPGA-based correlator hardware (used for synthesis imaging) with a commercial network switch and GPU-based digital signal processing back-end as shown in Figure 1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:_2SDbzJQXqAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ursi.org/proceedings/procGA17/papers/Paper_J2P-1(1291).pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w3ar97UVUw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
