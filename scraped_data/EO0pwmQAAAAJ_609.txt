SHEN", "citation": "", "author": "DL JAUNCEY and JE REYNOLDS and AK TZIOUMIS and V MIGENES and R GOUGH and EA KING", "abstract": "We present high-resolution very long baseline interferometry images of three southern radio sources that the Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET), on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, has identified as greater than 100 MeV gamma-ray sources. These are the first results in a continuing program of VLBI observations of southern EGRET identifications. For two of these sources, PKS 0208\u2013512 (at 4.851 GHz) and PKS 0537\u2013441 (at 4.851 and 8418 GHz), the images represent first-epoch observations. For the remaining lower redshift object, PKS 0521\u2013365, we present images from three epochs at 4.851 GHz and an image from one further epoch at 8418 GHz, spanning approximately 1 yr. We discuss the need for further extensive VLBI observations of EGRET-identified radio"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:GCDlZl827dEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/D-Murphy/publication/234456074_VLBI_observations_of_southern_egret_identifications_I_PKS_0208-512_PKS_0521-365_and_PKS_0537-441/links/0deec528fb99dac512000000/VLBI-observations-of-southern-egret-identifications-I-PKS-0208-512-PKS-0521-365-and-PKS-0537-441.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4aBlqGpml_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
