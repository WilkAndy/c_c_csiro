Radio, optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray coverage is simultaneous. We supplement the SED with additional non-simultaneous data in the optical through infrared where necessary. The compiled SED is the most complete available for this, the X-ray and radio brightest quiescent black hole system. We find no need for a substantial contribution from accretion light from the near-UV to the near-IR, and in particular the weak UV emission constrains published spectral models for V404 Cyg. We confirm that no plausible companion spectrum and interstellar extinction can fully explain the mid-IR, however, and an infrared (IR) excess from a jet or cool disc appears to be required. The X-ray spectrum is consistent with a \u0393\u223c 2 power law as found by all other studies to date \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:AFXcoJnoRH0C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4352873606640218236", "cites_id": ["4352873606640218236"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/399/4/2239/1037047", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fLD2k3uDaDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 16, "2017": 13, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
