The maser emission traces a warped, edge-on accretion disk between radii of 0.11 and 0: 4 pc, as well as a wide-angle out ow extending up to 1 pc from the estimated disk center. The disk rotation is close to Keplerian (v/r 0: 5), the maximum detected rotation speed is 260 km s 1, and the inferred central mass is 1: 6 106 M. The out owing masers are distributed irregularly around the center of the disk, with line-of-sight velocities on the order of 100 km s 1. No rotation is detected. The out ow probably is clumpy and originates at radii smaller than the molecular portion of the warped disk, which constrains some models for the production of out ows. The warped accretion disk appears to channel the the out ow, whereby its geometry xes the orientation and opening angle of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:yG35QFzCZWcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11143988990682707125&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tbSBkvFmp5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
