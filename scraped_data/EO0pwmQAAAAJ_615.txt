This project is aimed at determining what, if anything, dierentiates-ray-identiedradio sources fromsimilarstrong, at-spectrum radio sources which have not been identied as sources of greater than 100 MeV-rays. Four VSOP observations have been successfully completed as part of this project but only one has been correlated thus far, a 4.970 GHz observation of PKS 0637 752 from1997 November. Wepresent theVSOP imagefor PKS 0637 752 and makecomparisons betweenthe space VLBIimageand ground-based VLBIand ATCA images, as well as present ATCA ux density monitoring at 4.8 GHz. A brightness temperature for PKS 0637 752 of 0.7 10 12 K has been determined from the VSOP data and a tentative apparent superluminal speed, from comparison to the ground-based VLBI image, of 9.1 c."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:TSH-eZa2y_MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=846203452478747160&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GHK0gI5RvgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
