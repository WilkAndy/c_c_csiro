The first is astrometric: our proposed measurements use Parkes to anchor two times improvement of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) accuracy in the south. The more accurate source proper motions would improve constraints on cosmologic models by three times. The second is geodetic: to add extra geodetic VLBI observations which include the Parkes telescope, to those already being scheduled through the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:cUWptXWc3MAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12601020764122616625&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MZPZNJ_R364J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
