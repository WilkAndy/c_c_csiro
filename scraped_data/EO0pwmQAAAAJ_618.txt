The necessary phase stabilization of the opticalfibre links has been the subject of much research [1\u20133]. Applications include laser spectroscopy with extremely high accuracy at optical frequencies, and enhanced radiotelescope synchronization for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at radio frequencies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:z_Yq-I-xR0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13576151038113201421&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Db3Ji3AtaLwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
