For the first time to our knowledge, we have disseminated a suitable radio-frequency (RF) reference for VLBI over a \u201creal-world\u201d telecom optical-fiber link between radio telescopes that are >100\u2009\u2009km apart, by means of an innovative phase-conjugation technique. Bidirectional optical amplification is used in parallel with live traffic, and phase perturbations in the effective optical-fiber path length are compensated. This RF-over-fiber approach obviates the need for separate hydrogen masers at each antenna, offering significant advantages for radio-astronomy facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:WtgKeONp1i0C", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2137123824484554101", "cites_id": ["2137123824484554101"], "pub_url": "https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-5-2-138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dRVtn8uWqB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 11, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
