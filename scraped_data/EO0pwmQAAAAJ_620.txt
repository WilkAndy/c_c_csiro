In January 1998 the EGRET instrument onboard the CGRO detected a bright high-energy {ray outburst from its direction. Thus we had the unique opportunity to monitor the source in detail at various radio frequencies already before the detection of the {ray outburst. We also initiated multiwavelength followup observations. In this paper we present multiwavelength data for PKS 2255 282 before and after the {ray outburst. Further, based on the observations, we estimate some physical parameters for this source and discuss the various emission mechanisms possibly involved during this outburst."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.metsahovi.fi/pub/qso/PKS2255/Tornikoski.ps", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qlhoU7MnUcIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
