The Australia Telescope Compact Array is now able to resolve this region, which has dimensions of ~ arcsec, revealing a slight (10%) asphericity in the distribution of the low density gas within the [OIII] circumstellar ring. Assuming that the radio emission arises from a region just behind the shock front, we deduce a mean radial expansion velocity, from 1987 to 1992, of 29 200 kms. First observed contact of the shock with the [OIII] circumstellar ring could occur as early as mid-1993, depending on the deceleration in the intervening gas. This will probably be closely followed by shock-excited optical lines, a strong X-ray outburst and a further increase in the radio emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Dq1jD5C1HUoC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5741651337487008635", "cites_id": ["5741651337487008635"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/structure-in-the-radio-remnant-of-supernova-1987a/1EA46ECE6D3E48D3B43E5E9D2B6F9622", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e0MPi3hxrk8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 11, "1996": 2, "1997": 7, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 7, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
