The discovery was first reported in 2002 by Corbel and coworkers, and here we present an analysis of the three Chandra observations made between 2000 June and September. For these observations, a source is present that moves in an eastward direction away from the point source associated with the compact object. The separation between the new source and the compact object changes from 21 &farcs; 3 in June to 23 &farcs; 4 in September, implying a proper motion of 21.2\u00b17.2 mas day-1, a projected separation of 0.31\u20130.85 pc, and an apparent jet velocity between 0.34\u00b10.12 and 0.93\u00b10.32 times the speed of light for a source distance range of d= 2.8\u20137.6 kpc. These observations represent the first time that an X-ray jet proper-motion measurement has been obtained for any accretion-powered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:RjbMpExGKWAC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15158989335732949723", "cites_id": ["15158989335732949723"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/344703/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2xJMLnyMX9IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 9, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 8, "2008": 7, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
