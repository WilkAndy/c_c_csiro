The radio emission has evolved in time providing unique information on the interaction of the SN shock with the circumstellar medium. We particularly focus on the monitoring observations at 1.4, 2.4, 4.8, and 8.6 GHz, which have been made at intervals of 4\u20136 weeks. The flux density data show that the remnant brightness is now increasing exponentially, while the radio spectrum is flattening. The current spectral index value of\u2212 0.68 represents an 18\u00b13% increase over the last eight years. The exponential trend in the flux is also found in the ATCA imaging observations at 9 GHz, which have been made since 1992, approximately twice a year, as well as in the 843 MHz data set from the Molonglo Observatory \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Nw5Pwe77XXAC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16386094583915552732", "cites_id": ["16386094583915552732"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/710/2/1515/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3B898jQaZ-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
