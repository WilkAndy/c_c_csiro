Optical images have been used to model the host galaxy morphology confirming it to be dominated by a strong (and warped) disk component that is observed close to edge-on to the line of sight. This is the first radio galaxy found to reside in a disk dominated galaxy with radio luminosity equivalent to powerful FRII objects. At radio wavelengths, PKS 1814-637 is about 480 pc in diameter and it is classified as a compact steep spectrum (CSS) source; such sources are usually considered to be radio sources observed in the early stages of their evolution. However, the optical and mid-IR spectroscopic properties of PKS1814-637 show more in common with Seyfert galaxies than they do with radio galaxies, with the detection of H2, and PAH emission features, along with HI and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:bu5pTcyXo34C", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5646355532869164164", "cites_id": ["5646355532869164164"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2011/11/aa17686-11/aa17686-11.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hFw6BHHiW04J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
