These are the first in a series of observations intended to image all such sources at milliarcsecond resolution in order to determine their continued suitability for reference-frame use based on intrinsic structure. We use the resultant images to calculate a core fraction, that is, the ratio of core flux density to total flux density, for all observed sources. The resulting distribution, with a mean value of 0.83, suggests that most sources are relatively compact. However, just over half the observed sources show significant extended emission in the form of multiple compact components. These sources are probably poorly suited for high-accuracy reference-frame use unless intrinsic structure and potential variability can be taken into account.
