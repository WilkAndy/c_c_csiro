The X-ray outburst shows a very fast decay (initial e-folding time\u223c 0.5 days, slowing down to\u223c 2.3 days). The X-ray spectrum in the 2\u201325 keV band is complex, softening considerably during decay and with strongly variable intrinsic absorption. A strong iron emission line is observed. No fast time variability is detected (< 0.5% rms in the 1\u20134096 Hz band at the outburst peak). The analysis of the optical/IR data suggests that the secondary is a B [e] star surrounded by cool dust, and places the system at a distance of\u2273 2 kpc. At this distance, the peak at 2\u201325 keV luminosity is\u223c 4\u00d7 10 37 ergs s-1. We compare the properties of this peculiar system with those of the Be/NS LMC transient A 0538-66 and suggest that CI Cam is of similar nature.
