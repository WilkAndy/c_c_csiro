The nebula can be seen as a result of the interaction between the jet from the system and the interstellar medium and it is likely that we are actually looking toward the central X-ray binary system through the jet-powered radio lobe. The study of the nebula thus offers a unique opportunity to estimate for the first time using calorimetry the energetics of a jet from an object clearly identified as a neutron star. An extensive discussion on the energetics of the complex is presented: a first approach is based on the minimum energy estimation, while a second one employs a self-similar model of the interaction between the jets and the surrounding medium. The results suggest an age for the nebula of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11121340518782777706", "cites_id": ["11121340518782777706"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/372/1/417/988715", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ark0SEfwVpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 11, "2008": 14, "2009": 8, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
