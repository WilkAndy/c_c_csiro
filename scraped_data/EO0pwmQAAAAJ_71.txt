In order to quantify the asymmetry, we have redetermined as accurately as possible both the optical and radio coordinates of the source. The extended emission can be understood as a compact, absorbed core at the location of the X-ray binary and as extended emission up to 2 &arcsec; to the southeast of the core. The arcsecond-scale\u2013extended emission aligns with the larger, more symmetric arcminute-scale\u2013collimated structures in the surrounding synchrotron nebula. This suggests that the transport of mass and/or energy from the X-ray binary to the synchrotron nebula is occurring via the arcsecond-scale structures. The ratio of extended flux from the southeast to that from the northwest of the core is at least 2: 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:BW2nPTmhBn4C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18338077792756291824", "cites_id": ["18338077792756291824"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/311660/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Ni33Jfwff4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 9, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
