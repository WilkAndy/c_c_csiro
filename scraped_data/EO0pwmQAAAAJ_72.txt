Despite this pedigree, its detailed radio structure has remained obscure because its angular size, \u02dc 1 arcsec, is so small. We present here a new radio image, with resolution <10 mas, made by very-long-baseline interferometry using an array of 17 telescopes. We find a highly disrupted radio jet quite different from those found in standard high-luminosity radio sources. The jet lies well within the body of the gas-rich host galaxy of the quasar, and we believe that its irregular shape is due to collision with a dense clump of gas in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, rather than to any irregularity or precession of the central engine that produces the jet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10844812494734466510", "cites_id": ["10844812494734466510"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/352313a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zp1ddIGDgJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 6, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
