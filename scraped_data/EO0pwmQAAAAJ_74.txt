We have observed the source in the gamma-rays and X-rays with Ulysses and Chandra and in the radio with MERLIN. We report here the confirmation of a two-component X-ray spectrum (power law+ blackbody), indicating emission from the neutron star surface. We have determined that there is a dust halo, due to scattering in the interstellar medium, surrounding the source that extends up to\u2273 100 &arcsec; from the center of SGR 1900+ 14."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Ul_CLA4dPeMC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12307174138072432671", "cites_id": ["12307174138072432671"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/323496/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H4CuIKzdy6oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 13, "2004": 8, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
