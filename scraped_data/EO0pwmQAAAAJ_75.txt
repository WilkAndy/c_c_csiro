These observations were undertaken with the SHEVE array plus Shanghai station in November 1992. A sample of 22 sources was observed and images of 20 of them were obtained. Of the 20 sources imaged, 15 showed core-jet structure, one had a two-sided jet and 4 had only single compact cores. Eleven of the 16 core-jet (including one two-sided jet) sources show some evidence of bent jets. No compact doubles were found. A comparison with previous images and the temporal variability of the radio flux density showed evidence for superluminal motion in 4 of the sources. Five sources were high energy (>100 MeV) gamma-ray sources. Statistical analysis showed the dominance of highly polarized quasars among the detected gamma-ray sources, which emphasizes the importance of beaming effect in the gamma-ray emission."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Uwzdpet-joYC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15620254149343795371", "cites_id": ["15620254149343795371"], "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9709128", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q1j1oGNKxtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 6, "2000": 12, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
