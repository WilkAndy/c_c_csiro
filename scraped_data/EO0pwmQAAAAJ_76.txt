The X-ray analysis shows that the source was in the hard state, and then it transited to a soft intermediate state. We study the correlated radio/X-ray behaviour of this source for the first time. The radio counterpart to IGR J17091\u22123624 was detected during all four observations with the ATCA. In the hard state, the radio spectrum is typical of optically thick synchrotron emission from a self-absorbed compact jet. In the soft intermediate state, the detection of optically thin synchrotron emission is probably due to a discrete ejection event associated with the state transition. The position of IGR J17091\u22123624 in the radio versus X-ray luminosity diagram (aka fundamental plane) is compatible with that of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:RDd164uRGEsC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3597308173537094171", "cites_id": ["3597308173537094171"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2011/09/aa17511-11/aa17511-11.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G6pJd7k07DEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
