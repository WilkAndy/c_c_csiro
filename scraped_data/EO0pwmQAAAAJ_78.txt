Mapping of the highest resolution 3.5-cm data reveals a jet-like extension, which if confirmed would be the first detection of a radio jet from a persistent black hole candidate system. No evidence is found for associated structures such as bowshocks or jet lobes on larger scales. The spectral energy distribution from 22 to 3 cm is relatively flat, suggesting that emission is dominated by a compact absorbed core."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16552454991405048030", "cites_id": ["16552454991405048030"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/286/2/L29/1103473", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3uBWsx0ituUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 13, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
