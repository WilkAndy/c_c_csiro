With a reported X-ray Eddington ratio of 7 \u00d7 10\u22124LEdd, NGC 7213 can be considered to be comparable to a hard-state black hole X-ray binary. We show that a weak correlation exists between the X-ray and radio light curves. We use the cross-correlation function to calculate a global time-lag between events in the X-ray and radio bands to be 24 \u00b1 12 d lag (8.4 GHz radio lagging X-ray) and 40 \u00b1 13 d lag (4.8 GHz radio lagging X-ray), respectively. The radio\u2013radio light curves are extremely well correlated with a lag of 20.5 \u00b1 12.9 d (4.8 GHz lagging 8.4 GHz). We explore the previously established scaling relationship between core radio and X-ray luminosities and black hole mass LR\u221dM0.6-0.8L0.6X, known as the \u2018Fundamental Plane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:3BvdIg-l-ZAC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6653557112891121788", "cites_id": ["6653557112891121788"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/411/1/402/1041251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fCCmLvEuVlwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
