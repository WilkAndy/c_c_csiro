Plasma ejected from near the black hole traveled at relativistic velocities for at least 4 years. We present direct evidence for gradual deceleration in a relativistic jet. The broadband spectrum of the jets is consistent with synchrotron emission from high-energy (up to 10 tera\u2013electron volts) particles that were accelerated in the shock waves formed within the relativistic ejecta or by the interaction of the jets with the interstellar medium. XTE J1550\u2013564 offers a rare opportunity to study the dynamical evolution of relativistic jets on time scales inaccessible for active galactic nuclei jets, with implications for our understanding of relativistic jets from Galactic x-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:V0QqM0Py3VsC", "num_citations": 327, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7301933701558079815", "cites_id": ["7301933701558079815"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1075857", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R5HSpgOuVWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 22, "2004": 29, "2005": 33, "2006": 23, "2007": 24, "2008": 25, "2009": 21, "2010": 26, "2011": 15, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 12, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 6}}
