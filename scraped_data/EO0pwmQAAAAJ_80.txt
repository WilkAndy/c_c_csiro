The observations were performed with the Southern Hemisphere VLBI Network plus the Shanghai station in 1993 May. Twenty-three flat-spectrum, radio-loud sources were imaged. These are the first VLBI images for 15 of the sources. Eight of the sources are EGRET (> 100 MeV) \u03b3-ray sources. The milliarcsecond morphology shows a core-jet structure for 12 sources and a single compact core for the remaining 11. No compact doubles were seen. Compared with other radio images at different epochs and/or different frequencies, three core-jet blazars show evidence of bent jets, and there is some evidence for superluminal motion in the cases of two blazars. Detailed descriptions for individual blazars are given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:oy0z8GdgWhYC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=790239654319918297", "cites_id": ["790239654319918297"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300284/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2YwqW8d-9woJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
