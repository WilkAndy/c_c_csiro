In this paper, we present the full radio monitoring of this system during its \u2018failed\u2019 outburst, in which the source did not complete a full set of state changes, only transitioning as far as the hard intermediate state. Observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) show that the jet properties changed significantly during the outburst. The VLA observations detected linearly polarized emission at a level of \u223c1 per cent early in the outburst, increasing to \u223c3 per cent as the outburst peaked. High-resolution images with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) show an \u223c15 mas jet along the position angle \u221221 \u00b1 2\u00b0, in agreement with the electric vector position angle found from our polarization results (\u221221 \u00b1 4\u00b0), implying that the magnetic field is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:M9uBOdsrCRgC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15094966287743394056", "cites_id": ["15094966287743394056"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/450/2/1745/984164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CCFxtdwXfNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
