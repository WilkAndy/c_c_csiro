We obtained radio data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array for the duration of the \u223c9 month event. The light curves show that the radio emission from the compact jet persisted for the duration of an extended hard state and through the transition to the intermediate state. The flux then rose rapidly by a factor of 10 and the radio source entered a series of at least seven maxima, the first of which was likely to be emission associated with the compact jet. The subsequent six flares were accompanied by variable behaviour in terms of radio spectrum, degree of linear polarization, morphology and associated X-ray behaviour. They were, however, remarkably similar in terms of the estimated minimum power required to launch such an ejection event. We compare the timing of radio peaks with the location of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:zAdBnjttzAIC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6552660929064418579", "cites_id": ["6552660929064418579"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/432/2/931/1020947", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ez13wmW671oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
