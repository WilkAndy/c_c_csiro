We show that there is no radio source detected (with an rms noise level of 27 \u03bcJy) at the cluster centre of gravity or at the locations of any of the Chandra X-ray sources in the cluster. Based on the fundamental plane of accreting black holes which is a relationship between X-ray luminosity, radio luminosity and black hole mass, we place an upper limit of\u223c 1500 M on the mass of the putative intermediate-mass black hole located at the centre of NGC 6388. We discuss the uncertainties of this upper limit and the previously suggested black hole mass of based on surface density profile analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:f14mYpCygl4C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17226432467100591048", "cites_id": ["17226432467100591048"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/406/2/1049/1000233", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yGPJLA-VEO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 12, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
