The radio observations identify the position of 4U 1630-47 to within 1 &arcsec;. Because the radio emission is optically thin with a spectral index of\u223c-0.8 during the rise, peak, and decay of the initial radio event, the emission is probably coming from an optically thin radio jet ejected over a period of time. The 20\u2013100 keV emission first appeared 1998 January 28 (MJD 50841), the 2\u201312 keV emission first appeared 1998 February 3 (MJD 50847), and the first radio emission was detected 1998 February 12.6 (MJD 50856.6). The rise of the radio emission probably began about 1998 February 7 (MJD 50851) when the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:VBbLNo9YSJgC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9118952158048365966", "cites_id": ["9118952158048365966"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/306948/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ji1BaKwGjX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 6, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
