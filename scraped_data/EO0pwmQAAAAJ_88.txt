However, such objects are exceedingly rare: none were known to exist in our Galaxy. We report the discovery of the natal supernova remnant of the accreting neutron star Circinus X-1, which places an upper limit of t< 4600 yr on its age, making it the youngest known X-ray binary and a unique tool to study accretion, neutron star evolution, and core-collapse supernovae. This discovery is based on a deep 2009 Chandra X-ray observation and new radio observations of Circinus X-1. Circinus X-1 produces type I X-ray bursts on the surface of the neutron star, indicating that the magnetic field of the neutron star is small. Thus, the young age implies either that neutron stars can be born with low magnetic fields or that they can rapidly become de \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15810246700921739580", "cites_id": ["15810246700921739580"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/779/2/171/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PFm7s5tHadsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
