Follow-up observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton from 40 to 80 days after the flare reveal a bright X-ray light echo in the form of four well-defined rings with radii from 5 to 13 arcmin, growing in radius with time. The large fluence of the flare and the large column density of interstellar dust toward Circinus X-1 make this the largest and brightest set of rings from an X-ray light echo observed to date. By deconvolving the radial intensity profile of the echo with the MAXI X-ray light curve of the flare we reconstruct the dust distribution toward Circinus X-1 into four distinct dust concentrations. By comparing the peak in scattering intensity with the peak intensity in CO maps of molecular clouds from the Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey we identify the two innermost rings with clouds at radial velocity  and , respectively. We identify a prominent band of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:U5uP8zs9lfgC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10779658957229127306", "cites_id": ["10779658957229127306"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/806/2/265/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ivZ_YbUKmZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 11, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
