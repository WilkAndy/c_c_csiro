We discuss our survey methods, identification procedure, and first results. Our survey is found to be\u223c 95% efficient at finding flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSRQs; 59 of our first 85 identifications) and BL Lacertae objects (22 of our first 85 identifications), a figure that is comparable to or greater than that achieved by other radio and X-ray survey techniques. The identifications presented here show that all previous samples of blazars (even when taken together) did not representatively survey the blazar population, missing critical regions of (L X, L R) parameter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:ItgTnG0mAXQC", "num_citations": 289, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4900541014613460399", "cites_id": ["4900541014613460399"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/300283/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r4VErxY4AkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 20, "2000": 26, "2001": 16, "2002": 21, "2003": 18, "2004": 20, "2005": 12, "2006": 11, "2007": 11, "2008": 20, "2009": 10, "2010": 9, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 15, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 2}}
