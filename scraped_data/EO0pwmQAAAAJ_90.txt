In three sources\u2014the black hole transient XTE J1550-564, the neutron star transient Aquila X-1, and the quasi-persistent neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1705-44\u2014two such outbursts were found. We find that the flux of the soft X-ray peak, which lags the hard X-ray peak by a few days to several weeks, scales with the flux of the hard X-ray peak. We conclude that we are able to predict the soft X-ray outburst peak flux based on the\" preceding\" hard X-ray peak flux, implying an early setup of the outbursts. We also find that the X-ray luminosity corresponding to the peak of the hard X-ray flux, which corresponds to the X-ray luminosity of the start of the hard-to-soft state \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:Q3-QASNKTMEC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1193623713619379561", "cites_id": ["1193623713619379561"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/423953/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aQXEhXGakBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
