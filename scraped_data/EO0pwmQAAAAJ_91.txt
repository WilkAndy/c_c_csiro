These are the first results in a continuing program of VLBI observations of southern EGRET identifications. For two of these sources, PKS 0208-512 (at 4.851 GHz) and PKS 0537-441 (at 4.851 and 8.418 GHz), the images represent first-epoch observations. For the remaining lower redshift object, PKS 0521-365, we present images from three epochs at 4.851 GHz and an image from one further epoch at 8.418 GHz, spanning approximately 1 yr. We discuss the need for further extensive VLBI observations of EGRET-identified radio sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:RaRNlNDkcy8C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5641134704750567909", "cites_id": ["5641134704750567909"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1996ApJ...464..170T", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5SHJPiBWSU4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 5, "1998": 11, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
