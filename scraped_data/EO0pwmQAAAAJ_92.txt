The 0 farcs 35\u00d7 0 farcs 23 resolution of the diffraction-limited image is the highest achieved to date in high-dynamic range. We also present a new ATCA image at 18 GHz derived from 2011 observations, which is super-resolved to 0 farcs 25. The flux density is 40\u00b12 mJy at 44 GHz and 81\u00b16 mJy at 18 GHz. At both frequencies, the remnant exhibits a ring-like emission with two prominent lobes, and an east\u2013west brightness asymmetry that peaks on the eastern lobe. A central feature of fainter emission appears at 44 GHz. A comparison with previous ATCA observations at 18 and 36 GHz highlights higher expansion velocities of the remnant's eastern side. The 18\u201344 GHz spectral index is \u03b1=\u2212 0.80 (S \u03bd\u221d \u03bd \u03b1). The spectral index map suggests slightly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7844044598631044318", "cites_id": ["7844044598631044318"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/767/2/98/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3pS5vwCl22wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
