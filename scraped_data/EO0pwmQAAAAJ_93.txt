Baseline uncertainty values from which to judge the progress of this uncertainty reduction effort are required for the variety of hypersonic missions considered by the FAP. The purpose of this paper is to provide this baseline uncertainty value for the radiative heating of vehicles at hyperbolic Earth-entry conditions. In particular, conditions relevant to Mars or an asteroid return will be studied. Peak heating conditions for these entries may include velocities as high as 15 km= s at an altitude of 60 km [2]. Such conditions result in a shock layer that is fundamentally different than that formed for lunar-return conditions (10: 5 km= sat 60 km). Shocklayer temperatures and ionization levels are significantly higher for the 15 km= s entry than the 10: 5 km= s case. This higher velocity leads to radiation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:y2egTTA-ddEC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15614144018667130197,17820345328953748314", "cites_id": ["15614144018667130197", "17820345328953748314"], "pub_url": "https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.A32254", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vc1x-EGVsNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
