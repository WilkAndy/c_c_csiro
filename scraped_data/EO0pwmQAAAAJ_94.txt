We develop a parameterized three-dimensional torus model for the expanding radio shell, in which the emission is confined to an inclined equatorial belt; our model also incorporates both a correction for light-travel time effects and an overall east-west gradient in the radio emissivity. By deriving an analytic expression for the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the projected three-dimensional brightness distribution, we can fit our spatial model directly to the interferometric visibility data. This provides robust estimates of the radio morphology at each epoch. The best-fit results suggest a constant remnant expansion at 4000\\pm 400 km s\u20131 over the 16 yr period covered by the observations. The model fits also indicate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:sr8OKcTvXucC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9839914707512382309", "cites_id": ["9839914707512382309"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/590330/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZdNq2UpmjogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
