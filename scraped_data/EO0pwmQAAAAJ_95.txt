The observations put an upper limit of 1.3 mas on the source size (5.2 au at 4 kpc) and a lower limit of 7 \u00d7 106 K on its brightness temperature during the normal quiescent state, implying that the radio emission must be non-thermal, most probably synchrotron radiation, possibly from a jet. The radio light curves show a short flare, with a rise time of \u223c30 min, confirming that the source remains active in the quiescent state."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:3x-KLxxGyuUC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14302618064682468167", "cites_id": ["14302618064682468167"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/388/4/1751/981955", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R8N771kbfcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
