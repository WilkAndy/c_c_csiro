High resolution images, using the VLBI network in the southern hemisphere and the high resolution MERLIN array, are presented for all sources in the CSS sample. The overall morphology of each source consists of well-defined double lobes but with substantial diffuse and extended components present. In the majority of cases only a fraction of the total flux density is detected on the VLBI baselines, indicating the presence of larger extended radio structures. However, all sources are unresolved at arcsecond scales and are of sub-galactic size, with linear size in the range 0.1\u20132 kpc. The radio properties of the sources agree well with CSS sources in other samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:YW75zINC-7AC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5469101122178155073", "cites_id": ["5469101122178155073"], "pub_url": "https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2002/36/aah3656/node2.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QYIefH4m5ksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
