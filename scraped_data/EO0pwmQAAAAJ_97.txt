These images provide the highest resolution information to date for many of these objects. Comparisons are made between VSOP and previous ground-based VLBI results, including images from data extracted from the geodetic VLBI archive at the United States Naval Observatory. From the VSOP data, we find that the two radio galaxies observed have lower peak brightness temperatures than the 12 quasars. Also, these data show (1) no evidence for obvious differences between the brightness temperature distributions of gamma-ray\u2013loud and gamma-ray\u2013quiet radio-loud active galactic nuclei and (2) no evidence for obvious \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:DPnopAH2kssC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6174844098560854500", "cites_id": ["6174844098560854500"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/340783/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5Akj7v1zsVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
