However, so far, there have been no convincing reports of radio emission from white dwarfs undergoing stable disc accretion at a high rate, the so\u2010called nova\u2010like variables. Here, we present the first reproducible radio detection of a nova\u2010like cataclysmic variable. The accretion rate and the distance of the detected source V3885 Sgr are comparable to the dwarf nova SS Cyg during its plateau phase. The detected radio emission is also of a similar level, although the source seems to show a steep spectrum. Besides V3885 Sgr, we have also observed IX Vel as well as reanalysed the available data for AC Cnc. Due to dynamic range limitations for IX Vel, we were not able to reach the required sensitivity and only obtained an upper limit. For AC Cnc we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "EO0pwmQAAAAJ:2MSJ22rj538C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10890279408813237341", "cites_id": ["10890279408813237341"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/article-abstract/418/1/L129/1021740", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XWQQU2wLIpcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
