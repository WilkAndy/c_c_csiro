Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effects of a diet with a high ratio of protein to carbohydrate during weight loss on body composition, cardiovascular disease risk, nutritional status, and markers of bone turnover and renal function in overweight women. Design: The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 isocaloric 5600-kJ dietary interventions for 12 wk according to a parallel design: a high-protein (HP) or a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. Results: One hundred women with a mean (\u00b1SD) body mass index (in kg/m2) of 32 \u00b1 6 and age of 49 \u00b1 9 y completed the study. Weight loss was 7.3 \u00b1 0.3 kg with both diets. Subjects with high serum triacylglycerol (>1.5 mmol/L) lost more fat mass with the HP than with the HC diet (x\u0304\u00b1 SEM: 6.4 \u00b1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 700, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3362954293419877777", "cites_id": ["3362954293419877777"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/81/6/1298/4648756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kaUqtxydqy4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 11, "2006": 34, "2007": 36, "2008": 53, "2009": 38, "2010": 47, "2011": 44, "2012": 72, "2013": 44, "2014": 41, "2015": 45, "2016": 33, "2017": 32, "2018": 39, "2019": 31, "2020": 29, "2021": 25, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
