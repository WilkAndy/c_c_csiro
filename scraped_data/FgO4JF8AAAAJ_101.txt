Dietary fibre is composed largely of non\u2010starch polysaccharides (NSP), and greater consumption of NSP\u2010rich foods relieves simple constipation very effectively. Starch (as resistant starch, RS) is also receiving attention for its potential role in promoting colonic function. Resistant starch is that fraction of starch which escapes human small intestinal digestion and enters the large bowel where (together with a variable fraction of NSP) it is fermented by the resident microflora. The resulting short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are taken up by the large bowel and metabolised. SCFA mediate many of the health benefits ascribed to NSP and RS. Starch consumption is low in affluent westernised countries, despite recommendations by health agencies. In Australia, foods enriched in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14391265358811878551", "cites_id": ["14391265358811878551"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/star.200300221", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l9RdfJgLuMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 11, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
