Twenty-six mildly hypercholesterolemic men took part in a double-blind crossover experiment in which two test blends were compared with two control dietary periods [which resembled the Australian fat intake: proportions of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and saturated fatty acids (PMS) 0.4:0.9:1]. PMS in the test diets was \u223c0.8:1.3:1 and resulted in significantly lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations (reductions of \u2264 7.7%). HDL cholesterol and plasma triglyceride were unchanged. The trans fatty acid (mainly elaidic) content of the blends was 16%, raising its contribution to energy by 4% but without apparent effect on LDL and HDL concentrations.
