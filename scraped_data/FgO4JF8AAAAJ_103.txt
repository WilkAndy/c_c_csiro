Twenty-seven hypercholesterolemic men participated in a double-blind, crossover trial of three margarines: 1) high-linoleic acid, moderate trans fatty acids; 2) high-palm oil blend (predominantly lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids); and 3) an interesterified form of the high-palm oil margarine. Both high-palm oil margarines led to similar low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations (4.43 +/- 0.94 and 4.54 +/- 0.88 mmol/L, respectively), which were significantly higher than the LDL concentrations after the high-linoleic acid margarine (4.02 +/- 0.85 mmol/L, P < 0.001). Interesterification transferred substantial proportions of palmitic acid into the sn-2 position of glycerides and unsaturated fatty acids into the sn-1,3 positions, and this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10023696097909004532", "cites_id": ["10023696097909004532"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/62/5/950/4651769", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9NhVRH5SG4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 7, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
