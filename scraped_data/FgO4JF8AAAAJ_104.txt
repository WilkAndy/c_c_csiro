There is limited evidence for the effect of lifestyle modification and weight loss on these markers. The aim of this study was to determine if 20 weeks of a high-protein energy-restricted diet with or without exercise in women with PCOS could improve endothelial function.This is a secondary analysis of a subset of 50 overweight/obese women with PCOS (age: 30.3 \u00b1 6.3 years; BMI: 36.5 \u00b1 5.7 kg/m2) from a previous study. Participants were randomly assigned by computer generation to one of three 20-week interventions: diet only (DO; n = 14, \u223c6000 kJ/day), diet and aerobic exercise (DA; n = 16, \u223c6000 kJ/day and five walking sessions/week) and diet and combined aerobic-resistance exercise (DC; n = 20, \u223c6000 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2610207868295198700", "cites_id": ["2610207868295198700"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/27/7/2169/797831", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7DeqCzpSOSQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
