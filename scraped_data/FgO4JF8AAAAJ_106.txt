After a common period of salt restriction and salt supplementation, two sets of parallel groups continued with either salt or placebo tablets. The study was blinded, except for dietary adjustments based on 24-h urinary sodium excretion values measured once every 2 weeks. Blood pressures were also measured automatically once every 2 weeksResults:Urinary sodium excretion (sodium intake) correlated significantly with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14138486121807191387", "cites_id": ["14138486121807191387"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/abstract/1993/12000/enhanced_blood_pressure_response_to_dietary_salt.11.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W50bCDj-NcQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 7, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
