Whether this relation is altered in states of energy restriction and active weight loss is not clear. Objective: The objective of this 12-wk study was to compare the time course of lipid changes and other cardiovascular risk factors in 3 energy-restricted diets (all 6500 kJ) with different total fat and fatty acid compositions. Design: Sixty-two subjects with a body mass index (in kg/m2) >24 were stratified into 1 of 3 parallel dietary intervention groups: 1) a very-low-fat (VLF) diet (10% of energy from fat; 3% from saturated fat), 2) a high-saturated-fat (HSF) diet (32% of energy from fat; 17% from saturated fat), and 3) a high-unsaturated-fat (HUF) diet (32% of energy from fat; 6% from saturated fat).
