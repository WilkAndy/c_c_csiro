Subjects Fifteen normolipidemic male cigarette smokers who did not usually take vitamin supplements were recruited into the study. Interventions Throughout the study, subjects consumed a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which provided 36% of energy as fat: 18% from meat, dairy products, vegetable oils, and fat spreads and 18% from walnuts (68 g/day). Subjects consumed a vitamin\u2013free drink daily for 3 weeks; then for 3 weeks they consumed daily supplements of orange juice (145 mg vitamin C) and carrot juice (16 mg beta carotene). Results Vitamin\u2013rich food supplements raised plasma levels of ascorbic acid (1.6\u2013fold; P<.01) and beta carotene (2.6\u2013fold; P<.01).
