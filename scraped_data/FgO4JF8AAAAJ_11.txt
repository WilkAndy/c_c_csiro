Objective: The objective was to compare an energy-controlled LC diet with an LF diet at 1 y. Design: Men and women (n = 118) with abdominal obesity and at least one additional metabolic syndrome risk factor were randomly assigned to either an energy-restricted (\u22486\u20137 MJ) LC diet (4%, 35%, and 61% of energy as carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively) or an isocaloric LF diet (46%, 24%, and 30% of energy as carbohydrate, protein, and fat, respectively) for 1 y. Weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk markers were assessed. Results: Sixty-nine participants (59%) completed the trial: 33 in the LC group and 36 in the LF group.
