We compared a high-protein, meal replacement program with daily energy restriction (DER) to one which provided greater energy restriction adding alternate day fasting (ADF + DER; alternating days of modified-fasting and DER plus 1 ad libitum day/week) on retention, weight loss, physiological, nutritional, and behavioral markers. Participants were randomized to ADF + DER or DER for 16 weeks (n = 162, age 40 \u00b1 8 years BMI 36 \u00b1 6 kg/m2 (Mean \u00b1 SD)) plus 8 weeks weight maintenance. At week 16 weight change was \u221210.7 \u00b1 0.5 kg and \u221211.2 \u00b1 0.6 kg in ADF + DER and DER groups (treatment NS). Fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and lean mass (p < 0.05) were similarly reduced between treatments. Weight loss was sustained to 24 weeks (treatment NS). Fasting LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, hsCRP, glucose, and blood pressure all improved (p < 0.05; treatment NS). Transferrin saturation, ferritin, serum zinc, folate, and B12 improved (p < 0.05; treatment NS). Plasma thiamine and vitamin D levels decreased, reflecting lower carbohydrate intakes and seasonal changes, respectively. Food cravings, quality of life, and mood improved (treatment NS). Energy, fatigue, and pain improved slightly more in DER (p < 0.05). This study supports the use of higher protein, meal replacement programs with or without ADF in weight management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:WtgKeONp1i0C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1020732780009286381", "cites_id": ["1020732780009286381"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/330562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7eoMKw5fKg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 17, "2021": 17, "2022": 20, "2023": 7}}
