To date, only limited research has been conducted in male participants.Objective:To evaluate the medium to long-term effects of two, low-fat, hypocaloric diets differing in carbohydrate: protein ratio on body composition and cardiometabolic health outcomes in overweight and obese males.Design:One hundred and twenty males (age 50.8\u00b19.3 (sd) years, body mass index 33.0\u00b13.9 kg m\u2212 2) were randomly assigned and consumed a low-fat, isocaloric, energy-restricted diet (7 MJ per day) with either HP (protein: carbohydrate: fat% energy, 35: 40: 25) or high carbohydrate (HC; 17: 58: 25). Body weight, body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed at baseline and after 12 and 52 weeks.Results:Sixty-eight participants completed the study (HP, n= 33 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9309325533964124358", "cites_id": ["9309325533964124358"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nutd201211", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xsBnDkBeMYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 16, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
