Breakfast GL did not significantly alter changes in cognitive function or self-reported satiety throughout testing. Energy intake at lunch was not significantly different between treatments (HGL 2943\u00b1168 kJ; MGL 2949\u00b1166 kJ; LGL 2993\u00b1191 kJ).Conclusions:Reducing breakfast GL by replacing carbohydrate with protein does not alter satiety or cognition over 3 h in 10-to 12-year-old children."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4493800771108339637", "cites_id": ["4493800771108339637"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn201299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tf9J_f0vXT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 1}}
