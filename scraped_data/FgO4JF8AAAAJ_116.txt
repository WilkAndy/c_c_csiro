Following weight loss on either a high monounsaturated fat, standard protein (HMF; 50 % fat, 20 % protein (67 g/d), 30 % carbohydrate) or a high protein, moderate fat (HP) (40 % protein (136 g/d), 30 % fat, 30 % carbohydrate) energy-restricted diet (6000 kJ/d) subjects were asked to maintain the same dietary pattern without intensive dietary counselling for the following 36 weeks. Overall weight loss was 6\u00b72 (sd 7\u00b73) kg (P < 0\u00b701 for time with no diet effect, 7\u00b76 (sd 8\u00b71) kg, HMF v. 4\u00b78 (sd 6\u00b76) kg, HP). In a multivariate regression model predictors of weight loss at the end of the study were sex, age and reported percentage energy from protein (R2 0\u00b722, P < 0\u00b705 for the whole model).
