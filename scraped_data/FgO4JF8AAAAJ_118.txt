However, it is not clear to what extent the IGF system is normalized following diet, and the possible role of different types of diet is also unknown.To compare changes in the circulating IGF system following 12 weeks of moderate energy restriction (7000\u200akJ/day) in overweight or obese males on a high protein high red meat diet (HP) or a high carbohydrate diet (HC).Seventy-six men (mean age, 51\u00b11.0 years; body mass index, 32.8\u00b10.5\u200akg/m2) were allocated to matched groups treated with isocaloric diets of HP (n=34) or HC (n=42). Outcome measures were weight, body composition, IGF-related peptides, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA1-IR) and adipokines.Weight loss did not differ between diets \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5037914970991341902", "cites_id": ["5037914970991341902"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ejendo/article-abstract/162/6/1075/6676673", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TrGPXvlE6kUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
