Objective: The objective of the study was to assess postprandial responses to different protein sources, compared with glucose, in males with normal and high BMI. Design: This was a randomized, crossover study of four preloads followed by blood sampling (+15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 min) and buffet meal. Setting: The study was conducted at an outpatient clinic. Participants: The study population included 72 men, with a BMI range 20.6\u201339.9 kg/m2. Interventions: Interventions consisted of liquid preloads (1.1 MJ, 450ml) containing 50 g whey, soy, gluten, or glucose. Main Outcome Measures: Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 377, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1902356833141953101", "cites_id": ["1902356833141953101"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/91/8/2913/2656382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TZJ263WHZhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 15, "2008": 22, "2009": 24, "2010": 24, "2011": 28, "2012": 24, "2013": 26, "2014": 25, "2015": 29, "2016": 22, "2017": 22, "2018": 37, "2019": 19, "2020": 21, "2021": 10, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
