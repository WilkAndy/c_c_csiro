Decreased SHBG and elevated testosterone are associated with metabolic syndrome and glucose intolerance in women. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between SHBG and testosterone and metabolic syndrome and glucose intolerance in PCOS. Material/subjects and methods: Cross-sectional study in overweight and obese premenopausal non-diabetic women with PCOS (no.=178: no.=55 metabolic syndrome, no.=16 glucose intolerance). Data were analyzed by multiple regression with metabolic syndrome, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose or SHBG as dependent variables and reproductive hormones, insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, lipids or C-reactive protein as independent variables.
