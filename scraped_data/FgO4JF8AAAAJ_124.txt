Forty five patients [body mass index (BMI) 35.4 \u00b1 0.7 kg/m2; age 56.5 \u00b1 1.1 yr] with type 2 diabetes followed an energy-restricted diet (6\u20137 MJ/day) for 16 wk. Body weight, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment index 2 (HOMA2)], glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), triglycerides, resting HR, and HRV were measured before and after the intervention period. Mean reduction in body weight was 11.1 \u00b1 1.0 kg (10%), with significant reductions in blood pressure (\u221210%), total cholesterol (\u221215.9%), LDL (\u221217.7%), HDL (\u22127.5%), triglycerides (\u221221.2%), glucose (\u221223.4%), insulin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3314823187190692693", "cites_id": ["3314823187190692693"], "pub_url": "https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.01329.2010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vbu6RSCeAC4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 4}}
