The aim was to determine whether increased dairy or soy protein intake combined with resistance training enhanced strength gains in older adults.179 healthy older adults (age 61.5 \u00b1 7.4 yrs, BMI 27.6 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m2) performed resistance training three times per week for 12 weeks and were randomized to one of three eucaloric dietary treatments which delivered >20 g of protein at each main meal or immediately after resistance training: high dairy protein (HP-D, >1.2 g of protein/kg body weight/d; \u223c27 g/d dairy protein); high soy protein (HP\u2013S, >1.2 g of protein/kg body weight/d; \u223c27 g/d soy protein); usual protein intake (UP, <1.2 g of protein/kg body weight/d). Muscle strength, body composition, physical function and quality of life were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.
