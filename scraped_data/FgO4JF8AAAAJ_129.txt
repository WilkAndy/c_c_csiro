The high fibre content suggests that the grain may have potential as an ingredient in health promoting foods. In this study, 29 healthy volunteers consumed extruded whole grain breakfast cereal made from Himalaya 292 (123g) or a commercial hull-less barley (cv Torrens) (76g) each supplying 50g carbohydrate. Glycemic indices were 77\u00b113 (SEM) and 50\u00b19 for Torrens and Himalaya 292 breakfast cereals respectively (P=0.004). On this basis, the Himalaya 292 cereal is a low glycemic index food. The glycemic load (the product of glycemic index and the available carbohydrate content of a 60g serve divided by 100) of the new cultivar was 10.1\u00b11.8 compared to 25.3\u00b14.3 for the Torrens breakfast cereal (P<0.001).
