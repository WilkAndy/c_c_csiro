The mechanism and effect of protein and carbohydrate type are unclear. Objective: The objective of the study is to compare the acute effect of different proteins and carbohydrates on indicators of appetite and appetite regulatory hormones. Design: This is a randomized cross-over study of four orally consumed preloads followed by blood sampling (+15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 min), then a buffet meal. Setting: The study was carried out in an outpatient clinic. Patients and Other Participants: Nineteen overweight (body mass index 32.1 \u00b1 0.9 kg/m2) men participated. Interventions: Liquid preloads (1 MJ) contained whey (55 g), casein (55 g), lactose (56 g), or glucose (56 g). Main Outcome Measures: Plasma ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), insulin, glucose and amino acids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 375, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4045401926485621109", "cites_id": ["4045401926485621109"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/91/4/1477/2843514", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dTnbYZ4nJDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 14, "2008": 22, "2009": 23, "2010": 37, "2011": 30, "2012": 25, "2013": 30, "2014": 22, "2015": 27, "2016": 35, "2017": 23, "2018": 19, "2019": 12, "2020": 19, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
