The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Healthy Diet Score survey asks questions about the quantity, quality, and variety of foods consumed. On completion, individuals receive a personalised Diet Score\u2014reflecting their overall compliance with the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Over 145,000 Australians have completed the survey since it was launched in May 2015. The average Diet Score was 58.8 out of a possible 100 (SD = 12.9). Women scored higher than men; older adults higher than younger adults; and normal weight adults higher than obese adults. It was most common to receive feedback about discretionary foods (73.8% of the sample), followed by dairy foods (55.5%) and healthy fats (47.0%). Results suggest that Australians\u2019 diets are not consistent with the recommendations in the guidelines. The combination of using technology and providing the tool free of charge has attracted a lot of traffic to the website, providing valuable insights into what Australians\u2019 report to be eating. The use of technology has also enhanced the user experience, with individuals receiving immediate and personalised feedback. This survey tool will be useful to monitor population diet quality and understand the degree to Australians\u2019 diets comply with dietary guidelines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:QBUPEh0AvVMC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3871572391751938102", "cites_id": ["3871572391751938102"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/174438", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NnCV7JOWujUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
