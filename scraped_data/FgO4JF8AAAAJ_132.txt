Thirty-eight mildly hyperlipidemic subjects consumed a low-fat diet for 2 wk. They were then allocated to 2 groups and underwent 3 dietary interventions for 3 wk each in random order (diets contained 35% of energy as fat with 20% of energy as margarines or butter): group 1 (n = 18), butter, canola oil blend with TFAs, and TFA-free canola oil blend: group 2 (n = 19), butter, polyunsaturated oil blend with TFAs, and TFA-free polyunsaturated oil blend. Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations after consumption of all oil blends and after the low-fat diet were not significantly different, but were 11-15% lower than after butter (P < 0.001). Whereas the canola oil blends did not differ from each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:H1wcazwC3NUC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5378638017119373551", "cites_id": ["5378638017119373551"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/68/2/242/4648724", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:78jPgcfCpEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
