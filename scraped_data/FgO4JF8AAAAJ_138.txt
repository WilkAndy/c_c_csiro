This randomised study compared the effects of a HP diet (mean across both phases: 29% protein, 34% carbohydrate, 31% fat) to an isocaloric higher-carbohydrate diet (HC: 21%:48%:24%) on cardiometabolic risk factors for 12 weeks in energy restriction (~30% reduction) followed by 12 weeks of energy balance whilst performing regular exercise. Outcomes were measured at baseline and the end of each phase. Sixty-one overweight/obese adults (BMI (body mass index) 34.3 \u00b1 5.1 kg/m2, aged 55 \u00b1 8 years) with T2DM who commenced the study were included in the intention-to-treat analysis including the 17 participants (HP n = 9, HC n = 8) who withdrew. Following weight loss (M \u00b1 SEM: \u22127.8 \u00b1 0.6 kg), there were significant reductions in HbA1c (\u22121.4% \u00b1 0.1%, p < 0.001) and several cardiometabolic health risk factors. Improvements were sustained for 12 weeks when weight was stabilised and weight loss maintained. Both the HP and HC dietary patterns with concurrent exercise may be effective strategies for weight loss and weight maintenance in T2DM although further studies are needed to determine the longer term effects of weight maintenance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:CUz-cjXBMXMC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1674043374011367469", "cites_id": ["1674043374011367469"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/139912", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LUCLRpRlOxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
