Whether altering the GL by lowering carbohydrate relative to protein and fat has a role in these effects is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the differential effects of beverages varying in GL and dairy composition on appetite, energy intake and cognitive function in children. A total of forty children (10\u201312 years) completed a double-blind, randomised, crossover trial, receiving three isoenergetic drinks (approximately 1100 kJ): a glucose beverage (GI 100, GL 65), a full milk beverage (GI 27, GL 5) and a half milk/glucose beverage (GI 84, GL 35). For 3 h post-consumption, subjective appetite and cognitive performance (speed of processing, memory, attention and perceptual speed) were measured hourly. At completion, each child was provided a buffet-style lunch and energy intake was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11986675498492689926", "cites_id": ["11986675498492689926"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/effect-of-beverages-varying-in-glycaemic-load-on-postprandial-glucose-responses-appetite-and-cognition-in-1012yearold-school-children/E61848ACA729BC3FE8AA5AE7808B65F2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bv6Ilds5WaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
