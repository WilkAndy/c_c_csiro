Objective: We compared the effects of a very-low-carbohydrate, high\u2013unsaturated fat, low\u2013saturated fat (LC) diet with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HC) diet on glycemic control and cardiovascular disease risk factors in T2D after 52 wk. Design: In this randomized controlled trial that was conducted in an outpatient research clinic, 115 obese adults with T2D [mean \u00b1 SD age: 58 \u00b1 7 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 34.6 \u00b1 4.3; glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 7.3 \u00b1 1.1%; duration of diabetes: 8 \u00b1 6 y] were randomly assigned to consume either a hypocaloric LC diet [14% of energy as carbohydrate (carbohydrate <50 g/d), 28% of energy as protein, and 58% of energy as fat (<10% saturated fat)] or an energy-matched HC diet [53% of energy as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:wmBOIy6d62IC", "num_citations": 371, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2829587435092809577", "cites_id": ["2829587435092809577"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/102/4/780/4564662", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aZedyce2RCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 28, "2017": 43, "2018": 49, "2019": 56, "2020": 50, "2021": 42, "2022": 62, "2023": 14}}
