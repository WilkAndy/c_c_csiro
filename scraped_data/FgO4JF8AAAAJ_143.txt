We performed a randomized 12-wk parallel design study of two 6000-kJ diets: 35% energy from fat (high monounsaturated fat diet, HIMO), or 12% energy from fat (very low-fat diet, VLF) to determine whether this also occurred in nondiabetic women. Body fat distribution, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and fasting serum lipids were measured at wk 0 and 12 in 62 women (BMI > 27 kg/m2). Weight loss (9.5 \u00b1 2.4 vs. 9.4 \u00b1 3.4 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) and total fat loss (6.1 \u00b1 2.4 vs. 6.3 \u00b1 2.7 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) did not differ in the groups. There was a diet \u00d7 menopausal status interaction in lean mass changes (P = 0.005) such that in premenopausal women, HIMO produced a lower loss of lean mass than the low-fat diet (0.4 \u00b1 2.3 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 2.7 kg, P = 0.006) with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16674184813371970647", "cites_id": ["16674184813371970647"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/134/7/1741/4688645", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V9Q_gL6aZucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
