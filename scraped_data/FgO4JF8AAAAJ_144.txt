Consequently, eggs, as a food high in dietary cholesterol, have been targeted as a food to limit when advising patients on a diet to lower serum cholesterol levels. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the literature to address the effects of dietary cholesterol from eggs on serum cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease. An increase in dietary cholesterol from eggs by 100\u2003mg daily, equivalent to half a medium egg or three to four eggs a week, results in an increase of approximately 0.05\u2003mmol/L in LDL cholesterol. Adding 100\u2003mg of cholesterol per day (equivalent to three to four eggs a week) to a high saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of 0.061\u2003\u00b1\u20030.006\u2003mmol/L, whereas adding the same quantity of cholesterol to a low saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3709279838495884246", "cites_id": ["3709279838495884246"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2007.00093.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1sMQSlwCejMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
