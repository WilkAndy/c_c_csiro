Body weight, body composition, muscle strength and aerobic capacity were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks.Forty-two participants completed the study (HP, n = 21; SP, n = 21). Both groups experienced similar reductions in body weight (HP, \u221210.7 \u00b1 5.3 kg [\u22129.8%]; SP, \u22128.7 \u00b1 3.5 kg [\u22128.4%]) and fat-free mass (HP, \u22122.8 \u00b1 3.6 kg; SP, \u22123.2 \u00b1 2.7 kg; P < 0.001 time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11391281850914909700", "cites_id": ["11391281850914909700"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-012-0338-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BC4jZH32FZ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
