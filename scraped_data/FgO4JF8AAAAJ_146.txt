Psychological and reproductive disturbances may also be associated with increased food cravings but the relationships between these factors have not been explored. This study aimed to explore the pattern of food cravings and to determine the relationship between psychological distress, reproductive health and food cravings in overweight and obese young women using baseline data in a weight loss trial.

The most frequently craved food categories were fast foods (2.6\u00b10.07) and sweets (2.5\u00b10.05). Psychological distress was significantly correlated with food cravings (R2=0.18, P<0.05).
