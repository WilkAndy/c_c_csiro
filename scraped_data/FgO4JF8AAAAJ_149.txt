The aim of this randomised control trial was to determine the efficacy of two structured lifestyle interventions, differing in dietary macronutrient content, on insulin sensitivity and body composition in adolescents. We hypothesised that a moderate-carbohydrate (40-45% of energy), increased-protein (25-30%) diet would be more effective than a high-carbohydrate diet (55-60%), moderate-protein (15%) diet in improving outcomes in obese, insulin resistant adolescents.Obese 10\u201317 year olds with either pre-diabetes and/or clinical features of insulin resistance were recruited at two hospitals in Sydney, Australia. At baseline adolescents were prescribed metformin and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:kzhWOX1w8eAC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16946699720373760504", "cites_id": ["16946699720373760504"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12887-014-0289-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-PEWtJvFLusJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 11, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
