Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effects of aerobic and aerobic-resistance exercise when combined with an energy-restricted high protein diet (5000\u20136000 kJ/d) on metabolic risk factors and reproductive function in women with PCOS. Design and Setting: A 20-wk outpatient, randomized, parallel study was conducted in a metropolitan research clinic. Patients and Intervention: Ninety-four overweight and obese women with PCOS (age 29.3 \u00b1 0.7 yr; body mass index 36.1 \u00b1 0.5 kg/m2) were randomized to diet only (DO; n = 30), diet and aerobic exercise (DA; n = 31), or diet and combined aerobic-resistance exercise (DC; n \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 361, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10638708467488712905", "cites_id": ["10638708467488712905"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/93/9/3373/2596662", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yeiaIfxIpJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 17, "2010": 19, "2011": 25, "2012": 21, "2013": 29, "2014": 28, "2015": 37, "2016": 23, "2017": 31, "2018": 14, "2019": 29, "2020": 17, "2021": 24, "2022": 23, "2023": 12}}
