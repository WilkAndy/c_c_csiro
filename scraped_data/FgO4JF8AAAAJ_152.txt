Our objective was to establish whether intake of ALF in man can significantly improve folate status and reduce plasma homocyst(e)ine. We performed a randomised, controlled intervention, of 16 weeks duration, in free-living healthy individuals (mean age 46\u201352 years). Participants were assigned to one of three groups: ALF, 175 g bread made with ALF and placebo tablet each day; PCS, 175 g bread made with pericarp seed coat (PCS) flour and placebo tablet each day (low-folate control); or FA, 175 g bread made with PCS flour and tablet containing 640 \u03bcg folic acid each day (high-folate control). The daily folate intake contributed by the bread and tablet was 233 \u03bcg in the PCS group, 615 \u03bcg in the ALF group and 819 \u03bcg in the FA group. The number of participants completing all phases of the PCS, ALF and FA interventions was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12068279342839303575", "cites_id": ["12068279342839303575"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/aleurone-flour-increases-redcell-folate-and-lowers-plasma-homocysteine-substantially-in-man/158697935439F59932CDEEF29E39D8C0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lw0fMB8ke6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
