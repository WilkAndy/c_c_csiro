Lifestyle changes can significantly modulate the phenotype of this disease. Diet, exercise, smoking, stress, and other factors adversely affect reproductive outcomes, in PCOS. These influences can be modulated by structure change in an individual or group. Lifestyle choices should be discussed in this group of patients.
