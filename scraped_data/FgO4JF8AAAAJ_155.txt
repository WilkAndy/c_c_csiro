Sixty-seven women and 53 men were selected so that overall men and women had a similar mean age, LDL cholesterol, and body mass index. After a 2-week low-fat period subjects were given two liquid supplements for 3 weeks each, one that contained 31 to 40 g fat and 650 to 845 mg cholesterol, and one that was fat free. Measurements included plasma lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, hepatic triglyceride lipase activity, apolipoprotein E polymorphism, and three indexes of body fat (body mass index, waist girth, and waist-hip ratio). In response to dietary fat and cholesterol supplementation only the changes in HDL cholesterol, especially in HDL2, differed between the sexes.
