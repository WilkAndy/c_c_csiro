A total of 203 women (body mass index 33.3\u00b10.3, age 28\u00b10.3 years) received either prescriptive or general lifestyle advice for weight loss over 12 weeks. Linear mixed models found that the prescriptive lifestyle advice group had significantly greater weight loss (4.2\u00b10.4 kg vs 0.6\u00b10.2 kg, P<0.001) compared to the general lifestyle advice group. However, the prescriptive lifestyle advice group also had greater attrition (48% vs 31%, P<0.05) compared to the general lifestyle advice group. Linear mixed models found that the prescriptive lifestyle advice group had greater improvement in psychological distress (\u22123.0\u00b10.04 vs \u22121.1\u00b10.01, P<0.05) and in self-esteem (3.2\u00b10.8 vs \u22120.04\u00b10.04 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13637988040419021188", "cites_id": ["13637988040419021188"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002822309014254", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hJEzmN3dQ70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
