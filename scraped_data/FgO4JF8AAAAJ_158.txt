Methods: Thirty\u2010four men/women with T2DM (age 57 \u00b1 7 years and body mass index 34.9 \u00b1 4.2 kg m\u22122) were randomly assigned to the ingestion of a HP meal (860 kJ, 21 g protein, 0.7 g fat, 29.6 g carbohydrate) either immediately prior to RT or at least 2 h following RT. All participants followed a 16\u2010week, energy\u2010restricted (6\u20137 MJ day\u22121), HP diet (carbohydrate : protein : fat 43 : 33 : 22) and participated in supervised RT (3 day week\u22121). Outcomes were assessed pre\u2010 and postintervention at 16 weeks. Results: There was an overall reduction in bodyweight (\u221211.9 \u00b1 6.1 kg), fat mass (\u221210.0 \u00b1 4.4 kg), fat\u2010free \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4311316894540253779", "cites_id": ["4311316894540253779"], "pub_url": "https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01307.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U0o2jd_f1DsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
