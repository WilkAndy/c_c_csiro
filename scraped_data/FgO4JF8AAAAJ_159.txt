Research suggests that diets with a low glycemic load during pregnancy may reduce the risk of gestational diabetes or large-for-gestational-age births after adjusting for body mass index and total energy intake, but the effect of protein modification remains controversial. There is also lack of information on the impact of energy restriction during pregnancy on maternal and infant outcomes. Folate supplementation is recommended for prevention of birth defects but further research is required to determine the optimal dose to reduce the risks of multiple gestations. Further information on the upper limits of caffeine and alcohol intake during pregnancy would also be useful."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3165479269781718843", "cites_id": ["3165479269781718843"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/fulltext/2007/12000/Dietary_effects_on_fertility_treatment_and.8.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O8cz258K7isJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
