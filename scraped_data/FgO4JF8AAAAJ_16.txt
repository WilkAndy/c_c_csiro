We compared the effects of a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LC) diet with a high-carbohydrate, high-fibre, low-fat (HC) diet on indices of bowel health and function. In a parallel study design, ninety-one overweight and obese participants (age 50\u00b76 (sd 7\u00b75) years; BMI 33\u00b77 (sd 4\u00b72) kg/m2) were randomly assigned to either an energy-restricted (about 6\u20137 MJ, 30 % deficit) planned isoenergetic LC or HC diet for 8 weeks. At baseline and week 8, 24 h urine and faecal collections were obtained and a bowel function questionnaire was completed. Compared with the HC group, there were significant reductions in the LC group for faecal output (21 (sd 145) v. \u2212 61 (sd 147) g), defecation frequency, faecal excretion and concentrations of butyrate ( \u2212 0\u00b75 (sd 10\u00b74) v. \u2212 3\u00b79 (sd 9\u00b77) mmol/l) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 330, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10441257986649657767", "cites_id": ["10441257986649657767"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/comparative-effects-of-very-lowcarbohydrate-highfat-and-highcarbohydrate-lowfat-weightloss-diets-on-bowel-habit-and-faecal-shortchain-fatty-acids-and-bacterial-populations/331F2FCD72345936B7AEB10F3DA5BBCD", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p5F2ltHM5pAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 14, "2013": 16, "2014": 29, "2015": 23, "2016": 26, "2017": 25, "2018": 34, "2019": 28, "2020": 36, "2021": 30, "2022": 33, "2023": 7}}
