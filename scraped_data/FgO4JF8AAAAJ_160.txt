However, compared to traditional higher carbohydrate, low fat (HighCHO) diets, they have been associated with impaired endothelial function (measured by flow mediated dilatation [FMD]) that is possibly related to saturated fat.This study aimed to examine the effects of a 12-month hypocaloric very-low carbohydrate, low saturated fat (LowCHO) diet compared to an isocaloric HighCHO diet.One hundred and fifteen obese patients with T2DM (age:58.4 \u00b1 0.7 [SEM] yr, BMI:34.6 \u00b1 0.4 kg/m2, HbA1c:7.33 [56.3 mmol/mol] \u00b1 0.10%) were randomised to consume an energy restricted LowCHO diet (Carb:Pro:Fat:Sat-Fat 14:28:58: < 10% energy; n = 58) or isocaloric HighCHO diet (53:17:30: < 10%; n = 57) whilst undertaking exercise (60 min, 3/wk). Bodyweight, HbA1c and FMD were assessed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:nrS8eym_YfUC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16207689216712355606", "cites_id": ["16207689216712355606"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915016312126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Fq8ReHhH7eAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
