To our knowledge, it is unknown whether these changes occur with 30% energy restriction and are sustained in the longer term. Objectives: We hypothesized that 1) a 4-d 30% energy restriction would enhance effects of intraduodenal lipid on gastrointestinal motility, gut hormones, appetite, and energy intake in lean and obese men and 2) a 12-wk energy restriction associated with weight loss would diminish effects of acute energy restriction on responses to lipid in in obese men. Design: Twelve obese males were studied before (day 0) and after 4 d (day 5), 4 wk (week 4), and 12 wk (week 12), and 12 lean males were studied before and after 4 d of consumption of a 30% energy\u2013restricted diet.
