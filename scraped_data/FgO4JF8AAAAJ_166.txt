This study compared the effects of an energy-restricted LC diet and traditional, higher-carbohydrate, low-fat (LF) diet on bone health after 12 mo.One hundred eighteen abdominally obese adults were randomized to consume either an energy-restricted (\u223c6\u20137 MJ/d [\u223c1450\u20131650 kcal/d]), planned isocaloric LC, or LF diet for 12 mo. Body weight, total body bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD), and serum bone crosslaps were assessed pre- and postintervention.Sixty-five participants completed the study (LC = 32, LF = 33; age: 51.3 \u00b1 7.1 y; BMI: 33.4 \u00b1 4.0 kg/m2). Weight loss was similar in both groups (LC: \u221214.5 \u00b1 9.8 kg, LF: \u221211.7 \u00b1 7.3 kg; P = 0.26).
