Subjects were matched for total cholesterol, age, body mass index (BMI) and plasma triglyceride. Gender-drug interactions were noted with men demonstrating only a 27% fall in LDL cholesterol with simvastatin when consuming a high fat (40% energy) diet compared to women with a 35% fall. In men, the lowest LDL/HDL ratio was achieved with simvastatin on a low fat diet (22% energy). Gender differences in the effect of simvastatin on HDL were confined to HDL; cholesterol, although the drug raised HDL2 in both sexes on the low fat diet. Simvastatin was responsible for an 11% X, increase in HDL3 cholesterol in men particularly when on a low fat diet but did not affect HDL3 in women.
