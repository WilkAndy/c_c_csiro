DESIGN: A 10-week prospective clinical intervention. SETTING: Clinical research unit. PATIENT(S): Fifty-seven overweight and obese women with PCOS (age: 29.8 \u00b1 0.8 years; body mass index [BMI] 36.2 \u00b1 0.7 kg/m2). INTERVENTION(S): A dietary plan of 5\u20136 MJ/day (\u223c30% energy restricted). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Heart rate recovery (defined as the reduction in heart rate after 1 minute from peak heart rate after a graded treadmill test to exhaustion), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and sex steroids before and after the intervention. RESULT(S): The mean percentage of weight loss was (-6.7% \u00b1 0.4%). There were significant reductions in waist circumference (-6.9 \u00b1 0.6 cm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7011093936976813714", "cites_id": ["7011093936976813714"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028208046402", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kt5lEMpoTGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
