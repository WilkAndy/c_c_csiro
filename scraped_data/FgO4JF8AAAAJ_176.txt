This study tested the hypothesis that genome stability in PBLs of overweight men who consume a high protein\u2013high red meat (HP) weight loss diet is different from that of overweight men who consume a high carbohydrate (HC) weight loss diet. Thirty-three male subjects were randomly assigned to an HP or HC isocaloric energy-restricted dietary intervention for 12 weeks intensive weight loss and weight maintenance up to 52 weeks. Blood samples were collected at 0, 12 and 52 weeks. DNA damage in PBLs was assessed using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay. Average weight loss after 12 weeks was 9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 kg for both diets \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14130121430251651835", "cites_id": ["14130121430251651835"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/mutage/article-abstract/24/3/271/1074613", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-8JIg5NGGMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
