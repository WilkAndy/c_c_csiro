Pre- and postintervention, participants\u2019 body weight and composition, handgrip, and isometric knee extensor strength were assessed and participants performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion.Results: Forty-three participants completed the study (LC = 23; HC = 20). Overall, peak relative oxygen uptake increased (+11.3%) and reductions occurred in body weight (\u221214.6%), body fat percentage (\u22126.9% [absolute]), isometric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:kMwF0kOiZPMC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12811432798752483730", "cites_id": ["12811432798752483730"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2014.911668", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kiluqUBay7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
