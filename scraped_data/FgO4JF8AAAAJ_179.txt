HDL cholesterol that is reduced in obese subjects paradoxically decreases during weight reduction. To determine how weight reduction affects HDL subclasses that are involved in reverse cholesterol transport, we studied HDL from obese diabetic subjects before and after energy restriction within background diets high in either carbohydrate or monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Body weight, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol decreased after 8 and 12 weeks of weight reduction. With the very-low-fat diet, HDL cholesterol decreased significantly at 8 weeks, but recovered to initial levels after 12 weeks as body weight began to stabilize. Plasma apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) decreased substantially and significantly at 8 and 12 weeks \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14599014493693372057", "cites_id": ["14599014493693372057"], "pub_url": "https://www.metabolismjournal.com/article/S0026-0495(00)12466-7/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mWZfR1UemsoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
