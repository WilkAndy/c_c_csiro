Mobile phones have the potential to deliver weight loss management programs that can encourage self-monitoring while also providing some behavioral therapy to assist users in developing personal skills that may be necessary for improved longer term weight loss maintenance.The aim of this study was to evaluate a program supporting weight maintenance, which uses a behaviorally based mobile phone app to manage weight, food, exercise, mood, and stress.In a randomized controlled trial over 24 weeks, the full version of the app (MotiMate) was compared with a control app (monitoring only; excluding mood and stress) for its effect on weight, diet, and psychological well-being. Both apps had the same visual appearance and were designed to deliver all intervention content without face-to-face contact. The control version included features to track weight, food intake, and exercise with limited feedback and no encouraging/persuasive features. The intervention app included more persuasive and interactive features to help users track their weight, food intake, and physical activity and prompted users to enter data each day through notifications and included a mood and stress workshopping tool. Participants were recruited through advertising and existing databases. Clinic visits occurred at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. At all visits, the clinical trial manager recorded body weight, and participants then completed a computer-delivered survey, which measured \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:vzY-6mMDyDUC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3359231280596514899", "cites_id": ["3359231280596514899"], "pub_url": "https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/9/e12882/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U_hVPg1jni4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
