Methods-Twelve week randomised parallel design of two 5600KJ diets: High meat (HM) 34% protein 46% carbohydrate 20% fat or low meat (LM) 17% protein 64% carbohydrate 20% fat. Results-One hundred women with a mean BMI of 32.6 and mean age of 49.3 years completed the study. Weight loss (Mean\u00b1SD):-7.6\u00b13.3 (HM) and-6.9\u00b13.5 kg (LM) and fat (-5.7\u00b14.0,-4.6\u00b13.7) and lean mass (-1.6\u00b11.9,-1.8\u00b11.8) changes were different from baseline but not between diets. There was a significant interaction between diet and baseline triglyceride (P< 0.05). Subjects with high TG (> 1.5 mmol/L) had greater loss of weight on the HM diet 7.9\u00b10.7 versus 5.9\u00b10.4 kg (P= 0.02). TG fell by 8% in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:moWhu9_CcosC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4100195524022379429", "cites_id": ["4100195524022379429"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=33907951&h=tiKz1DDn6g46jBiZ0xPDhpG7h10t7pCX5Ey0P9fYUQ7iIFHxqQMeW4t%2FY%2Fr57EffAlH3xncGRaCfKEVOZUbqZw%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pSMA9xrS5jgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
