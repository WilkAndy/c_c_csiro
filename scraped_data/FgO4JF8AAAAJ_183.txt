We explored the relationship of cognition to glucose levels measured by a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) both before and after a weight loss diet.Subjects and Methods: Forty-four white subjects with type 2 diabetes (59.0\u00b16.2 years old; body mass index, 32.8\u00b14.2\u2009kg/m2; HbA1c, 6.9\u00b11.0%) completed an 8-week energy-restricted (approximately 6\u20137 MJ, 30% deficit) diet. Cognitive functioning (short-term memory, working memory, speed of processing [inspection time], psychomotor speed, and executive function) was assessed during four practice sessions, baseline, and Week 8. Parallel glucose levels were attained using the CGMS in 27 subjects.
