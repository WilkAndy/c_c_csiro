The aim of this study was to investigate whether a high-protein/high red meat (HP) diet influences faecal water genotoxicity and other standard biomarkers of bowel health differently compared with a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. Thirty-three male subjects were randomly assigned to a HP (35% protein, 40% carbohydrate) or HC (17% protein, 58% carbohydrate) isocaloric energy-restricted dietary intervention consisting of 12 weeks intensive weight loss followed by weight maintenance for up to 52 weeks. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 12 and 52 weeks. Faecal water genotoxicity was assessed in the WIL2-NS human B lymphoblastoid cell line by means of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay. Average weight loss after 12 weeks was 9.3\u00b10.7kg for both diets, with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3835820555990016004", "cites_id": ["3835820555990016004"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383571810002871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BCDt_XiSOzUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
