This study investigated the differential impact of consuming a meal, snack, or not eating during the nightshift on cognitive performance (ANZCTR12615001107516). 39 healthy participants (59% male, age mean\u00b1SD: 24.5 \u00b1 5.0y) completed a 7-day laboratory study and underwent four simulated nightshifts. Participants were randomly allocated to: Meal at Night (MN; n= 12), Snack at Night (SN; n = 13) or No Eating at Night (NE; n = 14). At 00:30 h, MN consumed a meal and SN consumed a snack (30% and 10% of 24 h energy intake respectively). NE did not eat during the nightshift. Macronutrient intake was constant across conditions. At 20:00 h, 22:30 h, 01:30 h, and 04:00 h, participants completed the 3-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT-B), 40-min driving simulator, post-drive PVT-B, subjective sleepiness scale, 2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:QzrXvYNrFw4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11729354867512618756", "cites_id": ["11729354867512618756"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420528.2019.1676256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BK-WchsKx6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
