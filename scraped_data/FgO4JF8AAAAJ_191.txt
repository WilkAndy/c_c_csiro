The objective of this study was to compare the effects of a HP and a higher-carbohydrate diet (HC), combined with regular exercise, on psychological wellbeing both during weight loss (WL) and weight maintenance phases (WM). In a parallel RCT, 61 adults with T2D (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: BMI 34.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1 kg/m2, aged 55\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years) consumed a HP diet (29% protein, 34% carbohydrate, 31% fat) or an isocaloric HC diet (21%:48%:24%), with moderate intensity exercise, for 12 weeks of WL and 12 weeks of WM. Secondary data evaluating psychological wellbeing was assessed using: Problems Areas in Diabetes (PAID); Diabetes-39 Quality of Life (D-39); Short Form Health Survey (SF-36); Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:cjagZD1ri60C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18344028007269191802", "cites_id": ["18344028007269191802"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12937-018-0367-5/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:etAYI0gUk_4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
