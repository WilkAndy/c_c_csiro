Objective: This report summarises the findings of an expert roundtable convened to review the evidence relating to dietary interventions to lower serum LDL-C. Discussion: Interventions that lower LDL-C lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Comprehensive dietary intervention is indicated in all patients with an absolute 5 year risk for coronary disease of 10% or greater. Short term trials indicate that these interventions have the potential to lower LDL-C by approximately 20%. A year long trial has shown mean LDL-C lowering of 13%, with about one-third of subjects achieving a reduction greater than 20%, highlighting the importance of adherence to dietary advice. The most effective dietary strategies are replacing saturated and trans fatty acids with poly- and monounsaturated fats and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8838717918430706086", "cites_id": ["8838717918430706086"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.246800372119014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pjnxBR5vqXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2}}
