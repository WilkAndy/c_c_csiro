Little is known about the duration of effect, influence of protein and carbohydrate source and relevance to non\u2010lean individuals. We compared the effect of various dietary proteins and carbohydrates on post\u2010prandial appetite ratings, ad libitum energy intake (EI) and appetite hormones in lean and overweight men. Three randomised double\u2010blinded cross\u2010over studies examined appetite response (appetite ratings, ghrelin, glucagon\u2010like peptide\u20101 (GLP\u20101) and cholecystokinin) to liquid preloads over three to four\u2003hours followed by a buffet meal to assess ad libitum EI. The 1\u2010MJ preloads contained \u223c55\u2003g of protein (whey, casein, soy and gluten), carbohydrate (glucose, lactose and fructose) or combined whey/fructose. EI was 10% higher following glucose preloads compared \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8134917509931618496", "cites_id": ["8134917509931618496"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2008.00265.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wFCU6F8I5XAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
