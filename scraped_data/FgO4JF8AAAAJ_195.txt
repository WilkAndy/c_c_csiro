A subset of these subjects (211 females and 45 males), were placed on a 30% energy restricted diet (6200 kJ) for 12 weeks. Subjects were assessed every 2 weeks and changes in body weight, waist circumference and BMI were used as determinants of weight loss. Fasting plasma was analysed for glucose, insulin, lipids and free fatty acids. 64% of subjects were GG homozygotes, 31% were AG heterozygotes and 5% were AA homozygotes. There was no significant difference between the allele frequency in healthy subjects (0.21) and type 2 diabetic patients (0.24).
