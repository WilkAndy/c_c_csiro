A review of the evidence", "pub_year": 1999, "citation": "Dietitians Association of Australia, 1999", "author": "Manny Noakes and Peter Clifton and T McMurchie", "publisher": "Dietitians Association of Australia", "abstract": "At the present time, the only conclusive dietary change that has been substantiated to reduce coronary heart disease risk appears to be factors that reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol. That is, a reduction in saturated fatty acids and trans fatty acids and an increase in n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, there is clear evidence that this may be too simplistic. There is growing evidence that more complex dietary patterns, including a constellation of protective food components from cereals, fruits, vegetables, marine sources and others offer opportunity to improve cardiovascular health. Eating a diet rich in foods containing anti-oxidant vitamins, phytochemicals, folate, dietary fibre and minerals such as calcium, potassium and magnesium, appears to offer substantial additional benefits to diets low in saturated fatty acids. From what we know about current nutrient intakes, there is considerable opportunity to improve the health of Australians by strategies which encourage the consumption of such foods or food components."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:7GbmjkRdlf4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1396709580820659225", "cites_id": ["1396709580820659225"], "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/8660", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GTwzs_YbYhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
