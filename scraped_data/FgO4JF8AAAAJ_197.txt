In the weight management space, very little is known about how a mobile phone app integrating features beyond text messaging (short message service) can affect behavior, particularly when combined with face-to-face support.Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a mobile phone app when combined with a partial meal replacement program including face-to-face support. This paper compares a static versus supportive app over a 6-month randomized trial for effects on weight loss, weight-related biomarkers, and psychological outcomes.Methods: Overweight and obese adults (71.2% female, 104/146; mean 48.11, SD 11.75 years) were recruited to participate in the weight loss study, and they were randomized on a 1: 1 basis using a computer algorithm. The supportive app (n= 75) provided information, food intake recording, rewards, prompts for regular interaction through reminders, and the opportunity to review personal compliance with the dietary program. The static app (n= 71) included only recipes and weight loss information. Both groups recieved equal amounts of face-to-face support in addition to app.Results: The overall reduction in app usage over 24 weeks was lower for the supportive app in comparison with the static app; approximately 39.0%(57/146) of the users were still using the app at week 24. Despite the promising results for app usage, there were no differences in weight loss between groups (F1, 128 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:4Bh_hC5jS3YC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8454850093177182802", "cites_id": ["8454850093177182802"], "pub_url": "https://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/4/e41", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UhoBMV2pVXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
