Overweight or obese adults (n = 146, 71.2% female, 48.18 \u00b1 11.75 years old) were recruited to participate in a 24-week weight loss study and randomised to two app conditions. The dietary intervention was consistent regardless of app. Twelve weeks of clinic appointments with a trained consultant were followed by only app support for an additional 12 weeks. By week 24, retention was 57.5%. There were no differences between app conditions. Based on a cohort analysis of the trial, the mean decrease in weight from baseline to week 24 was 6.43 \u00b1 1.06 kg for males (p < 0.001) and 5.66 \u00b1 0.70 kg for females (p < 0.001). Mixed models also revealed decreases for LDL Cholesterol (\u22120.13 \u00b1 0.08 mmol/L, nonsignificant), triglycerides (\u22120.08 \u00b1 0.05 mmol/L, nonsignificant) and an increase in HDL cholesterol (+0.08 \u00b1 0.04 mmol/L, ns) were not significant by week 24. Blood glucose (\u22120.23 \u00b1 0.08 mmol/L, p = 0.040) and blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure \u22125.77 \u00b1 1.21 Hg/mm, p < 0.001) were significantly lower at week 24 compared to baseline. Weight loss self-efficacy increased and remained significantly higher than baseline at week 24 (16.85 \u00b1 2.93, p < 0.001). Overall, the program supported participants and was successful in achieving significant weight loss and improvements in health outcomes over 24 weeks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:evIcR_-jKtEC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6876333137182952383", "cites_id": ["6876333137182952383"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/138832", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v4sJT46kbV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
