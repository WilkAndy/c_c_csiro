Change can have important implications for rural communities, employment, trade, public health nutrition and food security. This study compares Australian food intake scenarios to 2050 with linear projections for Australian agricultural production. The study is distinguished by its nutritional perspective, characterising food balance in terms of basic foods rather than food energy or macronutrients, as well as its systems perspective, taking into account the transformations that occur in food processing and cooking, livestock feed requirements, as well as supply chain and kitchen losses. With Australia\u2019s population projected to increase from around 23 million in 2015 to 37.5 million in 2050, substantial increases in domestic food supply will be required. Although the situation and outlook differ for each commodity, in most respects demand is projected to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:8wCixH_E2vEC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1889381953633894085", "cites_id": ["1889381953633894085"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-017-0650-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xb5hX-BuOBoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
