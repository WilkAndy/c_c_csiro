The SFA:MUFA:PUFA ratio of the oils were: palmolein, 42:47:12; olive oil, 17:76:7. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), circulating endothelial function markers, nitrotyrosine (oxidative stress marker), triglycerides, glucose and insulin were assessed pre-meal and hourly for 5 h. Mixed model procedures were used to analyze the data.Meal consumption increased serum triglycerides (time effect, P < 0.001); with no meal differences (meal \u00d7 time interaction, P = 0.93 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:t2c9fUEjrewC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5137295464302764006", "cites_id": ["5137295464302764006"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002191501500043X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5t_9lwFXS0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
