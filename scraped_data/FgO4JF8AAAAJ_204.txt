In a double-blind crossover trail volunteers consumed chocolate for two 4-wk periods separated by a 4-wk washout period. During the time the volunteers consumed the chocolate they also consumed a low-polyphenol diet. Free radical production in the fecal water was lowered from 122 \u00b1 10 \u03b2mol/l/h to 94 \u00b1 9 \u03b2mol/l/h (P = 0.009) when the high procyanidin chocolate diet was consumed and from 117 \u00b1 14 \u03b2mol/l/h to 86 \u00b1 12 \u03b2mol/l/h when the low procyanidin chocolate was consumed (P = 0.014).
