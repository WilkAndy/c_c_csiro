The aim of this study was to develop an index to estimate population diet quality using food purchase data. Supermarket receipt data of 1 month were available for 836 adults from a corporate office of a large retail chain. Participants were aged 19\u201365 years (mean 37\u00b76 (sd 9\u00b73) years), 56 % were female and 63 % were overweight or obese. A scoring system (Healthy Trolley Index (HETI)) was developed to compare food expenditure with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Monthly expenditure per food group, as a proportion of total food expenditure, was compared with food group recommendations, and a HETI score was calculated to estimate overall compliance with guidelines. Participants spent the greatest proportion on discretionary foods, which are high in fat/sugar (34\u00b78 %), followed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Mr27SXpvooAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14324012873769399405", "cites_id": ["14324012873769399405"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/feasibility-of-a-healthy-trolley-index-to-assess-dietary-quality-of-the-household-food-supply/F66BDB5386C53BFDD0D27870BA463751", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bbQlG9EdycYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
