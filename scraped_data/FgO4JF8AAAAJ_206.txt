However, it is unclear whether the metabolic benefits observed during weight loss are sustained during energy-balance and weight maintenance. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effect of HP diets on food cravings, cognitive function and psychological wellbeing in T2DM, despite carbohydrate food cravings, cognitive impairment and depression being associated with hyperglycaemia.Overweight/obese adults with T2DM were randomised to consume either a HP diet (n = 32, ~ 32% protein, 33% carbohydrate, 30% fat) or a higher-carbohydrate diet (HC, n = 29, ~ 22% protein, 51% carbohydrate, 22% fat) for 24 weeks with 30 min of moderate intensity exercise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:AyW1NBs4p6IC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6094385723646849687", "cites_id": ["6094385723646849687"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714415301129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l7Iutoabk1QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
