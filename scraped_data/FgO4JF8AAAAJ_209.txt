This implies that treatment that reduces body weight and insulin resistance would alleviate the symptoms of PCOS. Lifestyle modification has been found to be effective in restoring reproductive function in up to 80% of individuals who achieve at least 5% weight loss. However, long-term weight maintenance is a challenge. This article provides a review of reduced glycemic load diets, including low glycemic index, very low carbohydrate, high-protein and high monounsaturated fat diets, on metabolic and reproductive health in PCOS and non-PCOS populations. Dietary trials in non-PCOS women suggest that higher-protein, reduced glycemic load diets were probably more beneficial than the conventional low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet but further studies are required to confirm this in PCOS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13527764744068742599", "cites_id": ["13527764744068742599"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/17455057.3.1.73", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xz1Fj1xGvLsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
