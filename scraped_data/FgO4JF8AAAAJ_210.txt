Adults aged 20 years and older (n 1056) were followed from 2002 to 2007. Dietary data were collected using a 3-d food record and meal-specific (breakfast, lunch and dinner) food patterns were independently described by factor analysis based on the consumption of thirty-five food groups at each eating occasion. Each food pattern score was recoded as quartiles. Hyperglycaemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose >5\u00b76 mmol/l at baseline and follow-up. The associated between food patterns and incident hyperglycaemia was assessed by logistic regression. During the follow-up, 125 new cases of hyperglycaemia were identified. Traditional (wheat) breakfast was inversely associated with incident hyperglycaemia, whereas traditional (rice, vegetable and pork) lunch and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:DIP-VHrGjvwC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4597995572903114485,15324964005316307453", "cites_id": ["4597995572903114485", "15324964005316307453"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/mealspecific-food-patterns-and-the-incidence-of-hyperglycemia-in-a-chinese-adult-population/A869D8836665B0726BA9DD3787051658", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9Xa1wZxczz8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
