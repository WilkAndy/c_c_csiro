The effect of weight loss on the vascular inflammatory markers plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) is unknown. Overweight women with (n=14) and without (n=13) PCOS of comparable age and body mass index undertook an 8-week weight-loss programme. Women with PCOS had elevated PAI-1, sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 before and after weight loss compared with the controls. For all women, sVCAM-1 (P=0.026) and sICAM-1 (P=0.04) decreased with weight loss. Women with PCOS have elevated inflammatory markers, which are partially reduced by weight loss."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6503627666681550042", "cites_id": ["6503627666681550042"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472648312004579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2tT0t-eGQVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
