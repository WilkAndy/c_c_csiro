A total of 53 participants (62% female, 20\u201374\u2009years old) completed a semi-structured interview and quantitative measures after a 16-week weight maintenance period. Preliminary weight maintainers (who had maintained losses of, at least 10% of their original weight) were compared with heavier-than-baseline participants (who had re-gained more weight than was originally lost). The maintainers exhibited stronger problem-solving skills (p\u2009<\u2009.05). The heavier-than-baseline participants tended towards non-rational problem-solving styles. Qualitatively, the maintainers described more planning events and were more accepting of mistakes than the heavier-than-baseline participants. Implications are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:rR1SM4wcGAYC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4530075900762991952", "cites_id": ["4530075900762991952"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1359105316678053", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UC2JxgcQ3j4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
