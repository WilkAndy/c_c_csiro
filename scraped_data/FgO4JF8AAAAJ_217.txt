Weight loss improves the reproductive and metabolic dysfunction associated with PCOS. However, it is unclear what extent of adiposity reduction is required to restore reproductive function. Objective-To assess the relative effects of energy restriction and weight loss on changes in reproductive parameters and to assess the effectiveness of meal replacements as a weight loss strategy in overweight women with PCOS. Design-Overweight women with PCOS (n= 34; age= 32.6\u00b15.1 years; weight= 96.0\u00b119.5 kg; mean\u00b1SD) followed a weight loss intervention (two meal replacements, low fat snacks and evening meal daily) for 8 weeks. Fasting weight, waist circumference, body composition (assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis), blood pressure (BP) and venous testosterone, sex hormone \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:6UW509z96lEC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16965611126024624888", "cites_id": ["16965611126024624888"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=34013803&h=1PwWcyISoqcKZO%2FIlCWCr2CjN1hEc5O41fdbrUHsjZA6%2FvmX3Aki91sJLlB24kz88nac6HfSsid%2Fvxa9%2BtUN7A%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-NocdG71cesJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
