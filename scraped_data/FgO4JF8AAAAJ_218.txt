The response to fat and cholesterol in subjects with at least one apoAIV 2 allele was only 30% of that seen in subjects with the common apoIV 1 allele (P c 0.01), accounting for 67% of the variance in response. This confirms the results of two previous studies in which dietary cholesterol intake was changed.  3 No associations were seen with polymorphisms of the other five genes examined.
