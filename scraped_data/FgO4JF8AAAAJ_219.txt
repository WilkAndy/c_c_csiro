In total, 115 obese adults with T2D (sixty-six males, BMI: 34\u00b76 (sd 4\u00b73) kg/m2, age: 58 (sd 7) years, HbA1c: 7\u00b73 (sd 1\u00b71) %, diabetes duration: 8 (sd 6) years) were randomised to consume either an energy-restricted, very low-carbohydrate, low-saturated-fat (LC) diet or an energy-matched high unrefined carbohydrate, low-fat (HC) diet with supervised aerobic/resistance exercise (60 min, 3 d/week) for 52 weeks. Body weight, HbA1c and cognitive performance assessing perceptual speed, reasoning speed, reasoning ability, working memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, short-term memory, inhibition and memory scanning speed were assessed before and after intervention. No differences in the changes in cognitive test \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:yDGX1xMBWXcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6319409791712309883", "cites_id": ["6319409791712309883"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/randomisedcontrolled-trial-of-the-effects-of-very-lowcarbohydrate-and-highcarbohydrate-diets-on-cognitive-performance-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes/761CC40CC2DECA7B2260B5912F4F9694", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ezIjUbkNs1cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
