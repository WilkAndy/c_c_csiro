Women with PCOS appear to have lower bone mineral density (BMD). While steroidal contraceptives may positively affect bone health, their effect on BMD in PCOS is not known. The aim of this study was to assess BMD in women with PCOS according to recent contraceptive use. A cross-sectional analysis of 95 pre-menopausal overweight or obese sedentary women with PCOS [age 29.4 \u00b1 6.4 years, body mass index (BMI) 36.1 \u00b1 5.3 kg/m2] who either recently took steroidal contraceptives (ceased 3 months prior) or were not taking steroidal contraceptives was conducted. Clinical outcomes included BMD, anthropometry, insulin, glucose, reproductive hormones, dietary intake and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:bZtZ2VP7DRgC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8581964729379787950", "cites_id": ["8581964729379787950"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12020-015-0625-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rhSdwXNDGXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
