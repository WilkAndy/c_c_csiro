The primary aim of the present study was to retrospectively establish self-reported weight status in women, 3 years after participation in a 12-week food based structured weight loss program monitored by dietitians. The secondary aim was to determine which factors were associated with successful weight loss maintenance. Eighty-five of the 100 participants who completed the 12-week program participated in an 18-question telephone interview which included self-reported weight. Weight loss from baseline was 3.8 (S.D. 5.5) kg (4.4 (S.D. 6.1) %) (P<0.001). Overall, 61% of participants weighed less than at baseline, 13% had gained weight, and the remaining 26% had maintained \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16707382237588794801", "cites_id": ["16707382237588794801"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871403X07000440", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sa0mJqCL3OcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
