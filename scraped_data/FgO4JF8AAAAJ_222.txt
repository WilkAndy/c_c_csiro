Meal replacements as a weight loss strategy are widely used in the community however it is not known how effective they are outside a controlled clinical trial environment. Objective-To compare the use of meal replacements (MR) twice a day with a structured low fat (C) weight loss diet on weight, lipids, inflammatory and thrombotic markers and vascular physiology. Design-Randomised, parallel design in overweight volunteers with a triglyceride > 2 mmol/L. Outcomes-Fifty-five subjects completed 3 and 6 months. After 3 months weight loss (Mean\u00b1SEM) was 6.0\u00b14.2 kg (MR) and 6.6\u00b13.4 kg (C group)(P< 0.001) with no differences between the groups. At 6 months weight loss was 9.0\u00b16.9 kg (MR) and 9.2\u00b15.1 kg (C). At 12 weeks triglycerides fell significantly in C (0.48 mmol/L or 25%) but not in MR (4%)(P< 0.05 between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:cInq4TRmCz8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9535785235779864016", "cites_id": ["9535785235779864016"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=33907961&h=bErTNdTy6gp1P2vYkF0BOQUwFfE5GaFscGAglH8gu%2Fy6j5qduBZbtVcWjBxwg9rs3%2FBc0ulmTicvjMJYUwIaeg%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0MUSMSbqVYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
