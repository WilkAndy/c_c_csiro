Nutrient density scores and glycaemic indices for 95 carbohydrate\u2010rich foods were plotted on two dimensional axes, arranged into four carbohydrate quality quadrants. The classifications of foods and groups of foods were then assessed against Australian and American dietary guidelines' recommendations.Results:\u2002 The model showed considerable capacity to discriminate between the nutritional qualities of carbohydrate\u2010rich foods. In general, the ranking of foods was consistent with dietary guidelines' recommendations with most core foods including dairy products, legumes, starchy vegetables, breads and breakfast cereals falling into the two highest quality \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14336679131927784906", "cites_id": ["14336679131927784906"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2012.01590.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yq1PJbYd9sYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
