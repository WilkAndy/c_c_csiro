Diet and lifestyle are modifiable risk factors for these conditions and prevention is the optimal strategy for lowering their socio-economic impact. The risk of these illnesses is exacerbated by obesity, and there is evidence that they are emerging as serious issues in developing countries through greater affluence with industrialization (Mascie-Taylor and Karim 2003). Whole grain foods have a great potential to contribute to both the prevention and management of diet-related diseases and obesity. A number of prospective population studies have shown that consumption of whole grain products is associated with lowered risk of CVD, colo-rectal cancer, and diabetes (Hill 1999, Jacobs and Gallaher 2004, Truswell 2002). Greater intake of whole grain foods also is associated with lesser obesity (Koh-Banerjee et al. 2004).This protection is apparently strong and dose-dependent, and the effect remains after correction for potentially confounding lifestyle factors. However, the specific agency in whole grains which mediates the benefits has not been identified. Dietary non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), major components of dietary fiber, are potential contributors; these are generally present at higher levels in whole grain foods compared with refined products. There is good evidence that soluble NSP are effective in lowering plasma cholesterol, an established risk factor for CVD (Lupton and Turner 2003). However, soluble fiber is found at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:pNwUjlbgJN8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3112125245724903942", "cites_id": ["3112125245724903942"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vjMiz8b_1gcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA219&dq=info:Bkr1F2x9MCsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=kILHVqmjfS&sig=5_W-rJx4gdT2Wmct5iUwtwWvOmY", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bkr1F2x9MCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
