This dietary strategy raises safety concerns for bone health. The impact of dietary calcium in high protein diets on bone turnover has not been investigated. Objective-This study examined the effect of protein source and calcium content in high protein, energy restricted diets on calcium excretion and bone metabolism in 50 overweight adults (BMI 33.4\u00b12.1 kg/m\u00b2). Design-The parallel study consisted of a 12-week energy restriction phase followed by a four-week energy balance phase. Subjects were randomised to one of two isoenergetic (5.5 MJ/d, 34% energy from protein, 41% from carbohydrate and 24% from fat) diets; high dairy protein (DP, 2400mg Ca/d) or high mixed protein (MP, 500mg Ca/d). Outcomes-Energy restriction was the primary determinant of weight \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:GufwhD5tNfUC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4865181810288003027", "cites_id": ["4865181810288003027"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=33907952&h=DIPzLU4AIwleCQGuk7Smu1uuXoV8vm%2BgaO%2BJ6yPwly2E3P0w3rj3hihvus24cfFQ%2BLKn%2Bl8TTQZVQEGbfKW5vQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:04foYRSZhEMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
