After a 2-week low fat period, subjects were given two liquid supplements in addition to their low fat diet for 3 weeks each, one containing 31\u201340 g of fat and 650\u2013845 mg of cholesterol, the other fat free. LDL particle type was determined by 3\u201315% gradient gel electrophoresis. On multiple regression, LDL type was independently related to plasma triglyceride (P < 0.001), waist circumference (P < 0.01), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) (P < 0.001) accounting for 56% of the variance in LDL type in the whole group. Change in LDL cholesterol with dietary fat and cholesterol was unrelated to LDL particle size in either men or women. However, change in HDL cholesterol in men was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2997049032857999283", "cites_id": ["2997049032857999283"], "pub_url": "https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(20)32167-2/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s9ftYTeolykJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
