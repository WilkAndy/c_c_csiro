Validity was assessed by comparison against DXA using linear regression and limits of agreement analysis.Results: All three BIA methods showed good relative agreement with DXA [Imp\u2010MF: fat mass (FM), r2 = 0.81; fat\u2010free mass (FFM), r2 = 0.81; percentage body fat (BF%), r2 = 0.69; Imp\u2010SF: FM, r2 = 0.65; FFM, r2 = 0.76; BF%, r2 = 0.40; Tanita: BF%, r2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 249, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10356060187270966589", "cites_id": ["10356060187270966589"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1038/oby.2006.241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Pe3ZHt8duI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 13, "2010": 19, "2011": 16, "2012": 14, "2013": 25, "2014": 24, "2015": 16, "2016": 17, "2017": 9, "2018": 20, "2019": 16, "2020": 7, "2021": 18, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
