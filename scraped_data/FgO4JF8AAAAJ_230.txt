Objective-To compare a VLCARB diet isicalorically to 2 conventional weight loss strategies on a spectrum of cardiovascular risk factors after energy balance was re-established. Design-Sixty seven subjects aged 48\u00b18y, total cholesterol 5.9\u00b11.0 mmol/L, and BMI 33\u00b13kg/m\u00b2 were randomly allocated to one of 3 isocaloric weight loss dietary interventions which were energy restricted for 8 weeks (6MJ) and in energy balance for 4. The diets were Very Low Fat (VLF)(10% fat, 3% saturated fat), High Unsaturated Fat (HUF)(30% fat, 6% saturated fat) and Very Low Carbohydrate (VLCARB)(61% fat, 20% saturated; 4% carbohydrate). Outcomes-VLCARB resulted in 9.2% weight loss compared to VLF (7.3%) and HUF (7.0%)(P= 0.034). DEXA data revealed no difference in percent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:vK1Ni-xiviEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16775058936052664724", "cites_id": ["16775058936052664724"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=34013758&h=NuxvDqmD%2FfE8Z9JPOb4fVH50HTs5aoR8hN3Ma%2FkXkKHobo6fpIRNm0SYy3wgaSWXcxmO4pLfGTAwyscOBx%2BKDg%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lEmpaTn7zOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
