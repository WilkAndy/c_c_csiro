In this context, the quantification of dairy product waste is especially difficult due to the varied means of disposal, by solid and liquid waste streams, and due to inclusion as an ingredient in many processed foods. In this study, food intake data from the Australian National Nutrition Survey (>13,000 participants; >4,500 food items) were disaggregated into basic foods and total national dairy product intake was expressed in whole-milk equivalents. This result was compared with total domestic milk supply, indicating a level of waste of 29% for dairy products in the Australian food system. With national food-waste reduction targets becoming increasingly common, reliable estimates of food waste at the national scale are important for goal setting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:8U9l5EwV_MEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6660440876994073310", "cites_id": ["6660440876994073310"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030214005074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3hK5aLCjblwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4}}
