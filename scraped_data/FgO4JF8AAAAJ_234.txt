It is unclear if protein type affects appetite and energy intake. Objective--To investigate the role of whey and casein proteins, relative to high and low glycemic index carbohydrates (glucose and lactose, respectively) in appetite, energy intake and glycemic response. Design--Eighteen overweight men (53.4\u00b11.5 y, BMI 32.2\u00b10.9 kg/m2) with impaired glucose tolerance (6.3\u00b10.1 mmol/L) consumed a liquid\" breakfast\" preload (~ 1 MJ, 50 g of whey protein isolate, calcium caseinate, lactose or glucose) and ate an ad libitum\" buffet lunch\" three hours later. Preloads were administered in a single blind, randomised order and separated by a seven day interval. Energy intake, visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings of appetite and post prandial glucose and insulin were measured 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after commencing the preload \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2916236723383578885", "cites_id": ["2916236723383578885"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=34013759&h=A4rhbaSHfJGWv6ICUkCUmVZjHK5fTtMs2tOFBMJnN5cQiLIbxI74Bbz8CDIY%2Fem2BwdlolbgPmr3%2Fs%2Bx0F6pkw%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BTE6WtmNeCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 3}}
