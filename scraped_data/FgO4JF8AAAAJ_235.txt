We have previously reported that compared with consumption of a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet, despite comparable weight loss, a very low-carbohydrate (LC diet) impaired FMD and increased depression. The purpose of this study was to conduct a secondary analysis to examine whether there was an association between changes in FMD and depression.Forty-seven overweight men and women (body mass index 26\u201343 kg/m2 and ages 24\u201364 y) completed a 12-mo randomized controlled trial during which participants consumed either an energy-restricted, isocaloric LC or HC diet.
