Objective--To examine the effect of a low GI ingredient, BarleyMax\u2122,(barley cultivar, Hordeum Vulgare var. Himalaya 292; GI 49) incorporated into breakfast and lunch compared with otherwise identical meals containing a high GI ingredient (wheat starch GI 75). Design--Randomized single blinded cross-over study in 14 healthy women. The test breakfast was consumed at 7.00 AM. Insulin and glucose levels, appetite ratings using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and energy expenditure (EE) were measured before and after lunch which was eaten at 1.30 PM. VAS and food intake were recorded for the next 10hr. Outcomes--Area under the curve for insulin and glucose were lower after the low GI lunch compared with the high GI lunch (-35.5%, P < 0.001 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:L1d--jQnBlAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4515860036469195860", "cites_id": ["4515860036469195860"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601777&h=gZVZTz03vy56aP8gDtcEinZvq9BrQJWZM%2BbUIxKv%2BbPwp76L2F07781thE60ga85gaGnDqdUZw48HpHBkswZmQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VAQh8caOqz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
