Subjects completed a 16-week-dietary intervention comprising 8 weeks eating an enriched n-6 polyunsaturated fat diet (9.2% energy from linoleic acid) and consuming either a high monounsaturated or saturated fat diet in a random cross-over resign for 8 weeks. Neither FEV1 nor PC20 values changed significantly after increased linoleic acid consumption when compared with the other diets. Increased consumption of linoleic acid caused a 20% rise (p \u2264 0.01) in plasma linoleic acid, a 38% decrease (p \u2264 0.01) in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid, but no change in arachidonic acid. There were no changes in symptom scores or bronchodilator use."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4833225560185143828", "cites_id": ["4833225560185143828"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JAS-100002297", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FIIsGgoRE0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
