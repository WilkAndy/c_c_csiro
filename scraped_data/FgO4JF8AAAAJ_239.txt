This study compared an energy controlled HP diet with a high carbohydrate, low fat (HC) diet on psychological well-being after 1 year.117 obese men (mean \u00b1 SD, age 49.6 \u00b1 9.2 years; BMI 31.2 \u00b1 4.2 kg/m2) were randomised to consumption of either an energy restricted (\u223c7 MJ/day), HP diet (n = 57; 35% of total energy as protein, 40% carbohydrate, 25% fat) or an isocaloric, HC diet (n = 61; 17% protein, 58% carbohydrate, 25% fat) for 52 weeks. Body weight and psychological well-being was measured with Profile of Mood States (POMS), Bachman's Self Esteem scale and the SF-36 instruments at baseline (week 0), week 12 and week 52.Weight loss was (mean \u00b1 SEM) 8.9 \u00b1 0.4 kg (8.6%) at Week 12 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7427561203037450727", "cites_id": ["7427561203037450727"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212826313000808", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5zGFro__E2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
