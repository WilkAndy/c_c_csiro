A large portion of the kilojoules from apples comes from sugars which are primarily made up of fructose (~ 60% of total sugars), glucose (~ 20%) and sucrose (~ 20%). As a result, the Glycaemic Index (GI) of apples is between 28-44 and is in the low GI category (< 55)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:9q6z2NMJMYoC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16072901283898513330", "cites_id": ["16072901283898513330"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16072901283898513330&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:stewUI9qDt8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
