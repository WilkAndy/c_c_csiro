We speculated that individuals with a normal total cholesterol and coronary artery disease have an impaired HDL response to dietary fat. Twenty-one men with recently diagnosed coronary artery disease and total plasma cholesterol of <6 mmol/l were matched by age, weight and cholesterol with 26 men with no personal or family history of coronary artery disease. They were placed sequentially on a 25% fat diet for 2 weeks, a high carbohydrate supplement which reduced fat to 16% of energy for 3 weeks and a high monounsaturated fat supplement which increased fat to 35% for a final 3-week period. Half of the subjects underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test at the end of the intervention periods. The high fat supplement increased HDL cholesterol from 0.79 to 0.89 mmol/l in the men with coronary artery disease \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2898879948851560815", "cites_id": ["2898879948851560815"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915099003639", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b8HMXfTjOigJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
