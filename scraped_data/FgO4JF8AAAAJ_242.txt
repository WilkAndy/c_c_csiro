People always demand optimal taste, flavor and texture; they expect shelf-stability, convenience and novelty. The edible oils and fat industry has been particularly vulnerable in this regard but has tried, often very successfully, to modify its products to take into account the customer's preferences and their health. The following review illustrates some potential strategies in the retail and commercial sectors, especially in baking, frying and food service areas. Given the large increase in the consumption of convenient, small portion meals, the fat content and composition of such meals and products will critically influence further outcomes in areas related to cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16841139400500286518", "cites_id": ["16841139400500286518"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02637053", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NpSnew6_t-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
