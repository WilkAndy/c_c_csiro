Objective-To determine whether diets high in unsaturated fats induce greater endothelial vasodilation compared to diets high in saturated fat (SFA) or carbohydrate (CARB). Design-Cross-over design of 40 healthy subjects (19 men; 21 women) stratified by high or low (1.22 mmol/l women; 0.9 mmol/l men) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. Subjects were randomly assigned to 4 diets of 3 weeks duration which were isocaloric and enriched with approximately 20% energy as polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), SFA or CARB. Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) and fasting lipids were measured following each intervention. Outcomes-FMD was impaired following the SFA diet (5.41\u00b12.45% vs 10.80\u00b13.69% for all other diets, P< 0.01).
