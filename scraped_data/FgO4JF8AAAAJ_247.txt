It is unclear if the source of dietary protein exerts any affects. There is limited evidence that high calcium diets may facilitate body fat loss. Objective-This study examined whether a high dairy protein/calcium diet versus a mixed protein/low calcium diet affected weight loss and cardiovascular and liver function markers. Design-The parallel study consisted of a 12-week phase energy restriction followed by a 4-week energy balance phase. Fifty adults (BMI 33.4\u00b12.1 kg/m\u00b2) followed isocaloric diets (5.5 MJ/day, 34% protein, 41% carbohydrate, 24% fat) high in dairy (DP, 2400mg Ca/d) or mixed protein (MP, 500mg Ca/d). Body composition, glycemic control, serum lipids, blood pressure and markers of vascular and liver function were measured throughout the study. Outcomes-There was no effect \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:0PPYGq5nos8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4439506743517911679", "cites_id": ["4439506743517911679"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=33907953&h=Z%2FNocCP1ronn2k%2FqPfEYW8RnQ19wF%2B2oLxloeLfbWugg1L9T1K3k%2Fbryu7gk8x%2FEDn7X0EWfOjuYg416XJE09g%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fxpWmdxLnD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
