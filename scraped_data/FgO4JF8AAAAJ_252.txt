Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the elderly. If justified, supplementation offers a potentially cost-effective approach for maintaining cognitiondependent quality of life in aging populations. Exposure to UV light elevates the vitamin D content of mushrooms, which represent a novel and convenient source of dietary vitamin D (D2). Here we present the protocol for a study to determine whether increasing vitamin D status improves cognitive function, mood and depressive symptoms in healthy older subjects.Methods: The study is a double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 400 healthy male and female subjects aged 60\u201390 years old. Subjects pre-screened for confounders of cognition but not vitamin D status, are randomised across four groups, receiving daily supplement treatments in parallel over six months; either: vitamin D2-enriched mushroom solids, vitamin D3 alone, standard mushroom solids, or placebo. Primary endpoints are: changes in serum 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 metabolites and general cognitive performance. Secondary endpoints include mood and depressive symptoms. Data analysis will adjust for covariate measures. Blood samples taken at the three clinic visits (baseline, 5 weeks and 6 months) will be stored."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:quBVm8e4N6QC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16921445097285722427", "cites_id": ["16921445097285722427"], "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/files/262803910/262803580_oa.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O6H9jakM1eoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
