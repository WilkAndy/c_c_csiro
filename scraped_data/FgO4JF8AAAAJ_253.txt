These issues are closely related to the interrelated problems of excess energy intake, excess consumption of energy-dense nutrient-poor noncore (or discretionary) foods and overall nutrient deficiency which characterize typical diets. In this study, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated for more than 9,000 adult daily diets reported in the 2011/2012 Australian Health Survey. When higher quality and lower GHG emission (HQLE) diets were compared to lower quality and higher GHG emission (LQHE) diets, the difference in GHG emissions was 44% for males and 46% for females. The major differentiating factors were the total energy intake and the content of discretionary foods. However, compared to the national dietary guidelines, even males and females in the HQLE subgroup consumed, on average, less than the recommended minimum number of servings of vegetables, meats (and alternatives) and dairy products (and alternatives). Females in the HQLE subgroup also consumed, on average, less than the recommended number of serves of grains. Considering both males and females together, the average adult daily diet had GHG emissions 12% above a nutritionally complete dietary scenario based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:c0d25C_dN_AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11644717135841663447", "cites_id": ["11644717135841663447"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bradley-Ridoutt/publication/309400981_LCA_Food_2016_The_balance_of_core_and_noncore_foods_a_critical_intervention_point_to_concurrently_address_both_healthy_eating_and_dietary_GHG_emissions_reduction_objectives/links/580ec6d708aef766ef10e8ce/LCA-Food-2016-The-balance-of-core-and-noncore-foods-a-critical-intervention-point-to-concurrently-address-both-healthy-eating-and-dietary-GHG-emissions-reduction-objectives.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1xm_54lYmqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
