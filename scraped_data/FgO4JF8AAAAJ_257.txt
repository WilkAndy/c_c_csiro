No effects were seen on fasting plasma lipids, glucose or insulin However when the 2 starches (incorporated within processed, cooked foods) were compared after single meals, glycemia and insulin response were significantly less with high amylose (high resistant starch). Both oatbran and high amylose starch decreased fecal pH and secondary bile acids; only high amylose starch increased fecal volatile fatty acids especially butyrate by 32%(p< 0.001) High amylose starch (in bread, pasta and breakfast cereal) therefore dampened insulin hyperresponsiveness (p< 0.02) and changed large bowel environment into one that may inhibit malignancy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:ssyqJ5znRdsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15702295440212227124", "cites_id": ["15702295440212227124"], "pub_url": "https://research.sahmri.org.au/en/publications/high-amylose-starch-on-bowel-function-insulin-sensitivity-and-lip", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NPQVMILC6dkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
