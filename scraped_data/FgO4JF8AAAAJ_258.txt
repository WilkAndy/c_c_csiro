Dr Kawada raised a critical point regarding the provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) for cadmium (25 \u03bcg/kg body weight/month) proposed by WHO in 2013 [1]. We agree that the mean dietary cadmium intake in our sample is well below this PTMI. Several other studies in China also found that the mean dietary cadmium was below the PTMI, including Song et al's which found the mean cadmium intake to be 15.3 g/kg BW (compared to 13.6 g/kg BW in our study), and concluded that the health risk from dietary cadmium exposure of the general Chinese people was low [2, 3]. Such a conclusion may be risky from a public health perspective, as it suggests that there is no urgent need to intervene. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) set a more conservative provisional tolerable weekly intake for cadmium at 2.5 \u03bcg/kg BW/week [4].
