ALF has the  potential to make an important contribution to optimal nutrition because it  contains signicant amounts of naturally occurring nutrients including (a)  minerals such as magnesium, calcium, iron, and zinc, (b) dietary ber, (c)  protein, (d) antioxidant phenolic compounds, and (e) B vitamins including  folate (Tables 19.1 and 19.2) [1-3]. The aleurone cells, together with the germ,  contain the wheat grain\u2019s essential nutrients required for the growth and  development of the embryo [4, 5]. Because the bran fraction of wheat contains  the aleurone layer of cells, the phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals, ber, and  protein in aleurone cells are lost when wheat grain is rened to make white  our. Consequently, in recent years there has been an interest in devising  novel milling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16904928028238912214", "cites_id": ["16904928028238912214"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781420043853-23/aleurone-flour-novel-wheat-ingredient-rich-fermentable-fiber-micronutrients-bioavailable-folate-michael-fenech-peter-clifton-manny-noakes-david-topping", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1pq5vHlemuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
