The quality of the dietary data is critical for relating benefits to nutrient intakes. Although diet histories are often used to assess dietary intake in intervention trials, they have seldom been validated with objective measures. Objective-To determine, in a dietary intervention trial, the validity of the diet history method using erythrocyte fatty acid composition as a gold standard indicator of fatty acid intakes. Design-Overweight volunteers with mild cardiovascular risk factors and consuming less than one serve of fish per week were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n= 43) or the control group (n= 48). Subjects where asked to choose at least eight serves per day from a selection of either omega-3 fatty acid enriched foods (\u223c 125 mg very long chain omega-3 (VLC n3) per serve) or matched control foods \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17466150554841608927", "cites_id": ["17466150554841608927"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=34013750&h=XvXhZTOi766dyULMrJwsPGnipyKf5ArIHn%2FUeVLeNdEdwnnMByKwRH6nc5ZZUCoEhDobjFOMeNUcyvu%2BCuwTQg%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:33LT1mM7ZPIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
