Each sterol-enriched test food provided 1.6 g/day of phytosterols as sterol esters.Setting: General Community.Subjects: In all 58, free-living men and women with mean age (sd) 54 (8) y, moderately elevated plasma total cholesterol 6.2 (0.7) mmol/l and body mass index 26.2 (3.0) kg/m 2.Main outcome measures: Serum lipids, plasma phytosterols and carotenoids.Results: Serum total and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly lowered by consumption of phytosterol-enriched foods: milk (8.7 and 15.9%) and yoghurt (5.6 and 8.6%).
