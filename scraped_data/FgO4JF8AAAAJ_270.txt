Design: Volunteers who were overweight and had elevated plasma lipids were enrolled in a 6-month dietary intervention trial at Adelaide (n= 50) and Perth (n= 44). A variety of \u03c93/d enriched foods and matching control foods including bread, milk, spread, eggs, biscuits, cereals, soups, pancake mix, muffin mix, salad dressing, dips, snacks and chocolates were prepared for the trial by Goodman Fielder Ltd. Subjects were randomised to choose 8 serves per day from a selection of either control or enriched foods (\u223c 125mg \u03c93 per serve) and to substitute them for equivalent foods in their regular diet.
