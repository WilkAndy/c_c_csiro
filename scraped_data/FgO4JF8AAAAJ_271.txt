It is unknown if attention is affected immediately after eating at night and whether, like sleep inertia, this effect is transient and dose-dependent. This study investigated whether a meal, a snack or not eating, differentially impacted attention throughout the nightshift.Healthy males (n=19) and females (n=11) aged 18\u201339 years (BMI 23.4 \u00b1 2.3kg/m2) underwent four simulated nightshifts. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: meal (n=10; males:females, 5:5) or snack (n=10; 6:4), with 30% and 10% of 24h energy intake respectively consumed at 0030h, or no eating (n=10; 8:2), with no energy consumed during the night. Across conditions, total macronutrient intake and individual energy needs were maintained and constant each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:GPTxl2ZukFYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6225606671295717974", "cites_id": ["6225606671295717974"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/suppl_1/A67/4988206", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ViLiaUjMZVYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2}}
