Naturally, not all diets that are low in GHG emissions are also nutritionally adequate. Many discretionary foods, like soft drinks and biscuits, are in the lower range in terms of GHG-intensive foods (2). Within society there can be found a matrix of diets with both higher and lower dietary quality as well as higher and lower GHG emissions. As such, the critical question is how the GHG emissions of average diets compare with the GHG emissions of dietary patterns consistent with national dietary guidelines. Recommended diets are nutritionally complete and if they are also found to be lower in GHG emissions then there is a reinforcing environmental message that can be used to encourage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:jhmUvTrEinIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11509097164969898997", "cites_id": ["11509097164969898997"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/recommended-diets-in-australia-are-nutrient-rich-and-have-lower-greenhouse-gas-emissions/2B24FE4E8ABEB5B169F4790E8454DE9E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9XN8y-SGuJ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
