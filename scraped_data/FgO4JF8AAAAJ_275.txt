A large portion of the calories from apples comes from sugars which are primarily made up of fructose (~ 60% of total sugars), glucose (~ 20%) and sucrose (~ 20%). As a result, the Glycaemic Index (GI) of apples is between 28-44 and is in the low GI category (< 55).\u2022 While a number of fruits and juices have higher in vitro antioxidant capacity than apples and apple juices, it is important to note that apples are the largest contributors of fruit phenolics (in the American diet, and very likely in the Australian diet), and apples and strawberries are the biggest suppliers of cellular antioxidant activity due to levels of consumption."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Cn5sofW4b3YC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4107037504250156991", "cites_id": ["4107037504250156991"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP101170&dsid=DS1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v5cJoNkg_zgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
