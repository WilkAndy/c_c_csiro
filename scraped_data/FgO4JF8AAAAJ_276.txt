We also studied the relationship of these parameters with plasma folate, vitamin B12, zinc, magnesium and selenium immediately before the intervention and change in plasma glucose and plasma insulin during the two\u2010hour period after consumption. There was no effect of protein, CHO or GI on genome damage or immune responsiveness except for a small but significant improvement in resistance to radiation\u2010induced DNA damage in the high\u2010GI CHO food relative to the casein food. Mitogen response was significantly and positively correlated with plasma zinc \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15429685177277449628", "cites_id": ["15429685177277449628"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2008.00257.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nIW7M-tAIdYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
