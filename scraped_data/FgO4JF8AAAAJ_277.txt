These are two separate attributes\u2014the former being termed \u2018satiation\u2019and the latter \u2018satiety\u2019. Much of the research that has been conducted on food composition has generally focused on \u2018satiety\u2019\u2014subjectively defined as the feeling of fullness or satisfaction that follows eating. It is generally measured by questionnaire using a visual analogue scale after a food has been consumed. In addition, some studies combine this approach with exposure of the participants to a buffet meal and measure food consumed, which represents a more objective measure of satiety.
