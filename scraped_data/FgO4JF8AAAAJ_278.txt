Objective--To determine whether appetite, ad libitum energy intake (EI) and post prandial satiety hormones are affected by protein type, relative to glucose. Design--Seventy-two men, BMI 27.7\u00b10.5 kg/m\u00b2 (range 20.7-40.0) consumed a liquid preload (1.1 MJ, 400 ml) containing 50 g of whey protein isolate, soy protein isolate, gluten or glucose a randomised order. Subjective appetite was measured for 3 h after preloads (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180min) followed by a buffet lunch to assess ad libitum EI. Plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),(satiety hormones), ghrelin (a'hunger'hormone) were measured in a subset of participants (n= 38) after each appetite measurement. Outcomes--EI was higher (+ 401\u00b167 kJ \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Y7HEs_YmcnEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7843257407845495368", "cites_id": ["7843257407845495368"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601729&h=WTxCMw%2F%2BG0LDg7JxYJ6mvGQBTkn%2Bn7G1pwuj8ptkfy09L5erb5zu1iCJjGnjYD2l%2B6I0JwdmEvrGvI5q0I3Adw%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SPKUnA7Z2GwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
