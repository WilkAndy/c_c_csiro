Although weight loss has been shown to improve metabolic and reproductive fitness in this group (1), the effect of varying diet composition has not been researched. Recently there has been increased community interest in a high protein/low carbohydrate diet. This may aid in increased weight loss (2) due to the increased satiating power of protein and may improve insulin sensitivity through maintenance of lean body mass with weight loss (3). This randomised controlled trial examined the differential effects of replacing dietary protein with carbohydrate in weight loss on reproductive and metabolic physiology. Overweight women (mean BMI 37.7\u00b16.5 m2) were randomised to either a low protein (LP)(n= 14)(30% fat, 55% carbohydrate, 15% protein) or a high protein (HP)(n= 14)(30% fat, 40% carbohydrate, 30% protein) diet. The diet consisted of 12 weeks energy restriction (~ 6000 kJ) followed by 4 weeks weight maintenance with a weekly exercise and support group throughout. Improvements in menstrual cyclicity (ovulation and menstrual cycle lengths), insulin homeostasis and lipid profile and decreases in weight (7.5%) and abdominal fat (12.5%) occurred independent of diet composition. 3 pregnancies additionally resulted (2 HP, 1 LP). Improvements in menstrual cyclicity were associated with greater decreases in insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis model, and fasting insulin (P= 0.011).
