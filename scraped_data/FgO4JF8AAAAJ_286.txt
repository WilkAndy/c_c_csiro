The effects of gender, age, body mass and body fat distribution were studied. After a 2 week low-fat period, subjects were given 2 liquid supplements for 3 weeks each. One supplement contained 31-40 g fat and 650-845 mg cholesterol and the other was fat-free. The lipoprotein responses to diet were gender specific: the increase in HDL and HDL 2 cholesterol was greater in women than men. Changes in LDL cholesterol in men and women were similar. Fat distribution and BMI were important determinants of the HDL response to diet. The gender difference could partly be explained by the differences in fat distribution between men and women."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:0KrOiVmbFBYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12626937343534050322", "cites_id": ["12626937343534050322"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19971409204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Eix2Ep3kO68J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
