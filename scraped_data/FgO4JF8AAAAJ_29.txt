It is unknown whether the effect is due to increased protein or reduced carbohydrate. Objective: We compared the effects of 2 isocaloric diets that differed in protein and fat content on weight loss, lipids, appetite regulation, and energy expenditure after test meals. Design: This was a parallel, randomized study in which subjects received either a low-fat, high-protein (LF-HP) diet (29 \u00b1 1% fat, 34 \u00b1 0.8% protein) or a high-fat, standard-protein (HF-SP) diet (45 \u00b1 0.6% fat, 18 \u00b1 0.3% protein) during 12 wk of energy restriction (6 \u00b1 0.1 MJ/d) and 4 wk of energy balance (7.4 \u00b1 0.3 MJ/d). Fifty-seven overweight and obese [mean body mass index (in kg/m2): 33.8 \u00b1 0.9] volunteers with insulin concentrations >12 mU/L completed the study.
