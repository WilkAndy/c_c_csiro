Body weight, bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD) and serum bone cross laps were assessed pre\u2010 and post\u2010intervention. Weight loss was similar in both groups (VLC \u221214.5 \u00b1 9.9 kg, HC \u221211.7 \u00b1 7.3 kg; P=0.16). By 1 year, BMC had not changed in either group (VLC 2.84 \u00b1 0.47 to 2.88 \u00b1 0.49 kg, HC 3.01 \u00b1 0.52 to 3.00 \u00b1 0.51 kg; P =0.18 time \u00d7 diet effect). Both groups had significant decreases in BMD (VLC 1.27 \u00b1 0.09 to 1.23 \u00b1 0.09 g/m2, HC 1.26 \u00b1 0.09 to 1.23 to 0.08 g/m2, P<0.001) and increases in bone serum crosslaps (VLC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4861732025165311299", "cites_id": ["4861732025165311299"], "pub_url": "https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.25.1_supplement.774.16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q20esYRXeEMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
