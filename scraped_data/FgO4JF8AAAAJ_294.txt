In addition to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, diabetes is associated with abnormalities of cardiac contractility. Normalisation of blood glucose partially reverses these abnormalities in Type 1 diabetic studies, but not in Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is closely linked to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. We hypothesised that weight loss could reverse early vascular and cardiac contractile abnormalities in Type 2 diabetics.Methods: Twenty-one overweight Type 2 diabetic men (age: 49\u00b114 years), underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)(1.5 T Siemens Sonata) and echocardiography (GE Vivid-7) before and after an 8-week 800 cal/day weight loss programme. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) was quantified volumetrically by CMR in the standard way. LV diastolic filling pressure was estimated by echocardiography \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8763644793960433888", "cites_id": ["8763644793960433888"], "pub_url": "https://www.heartlungcirc.org/article/S1443-9506(08)00503-9/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4Ii2IYK4nnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
