Objective--To assess the use of meal replacements as a weight loss strategy and the effects of carbohydrate or fat restriction on weight maintenance, reproductive and metabolic parameters in overweight women with PCOS. Design--Overweight women with PCOS (n= 43; age= 32.1\u00b15.2 years; weight= 96.1\u00b118.4 kg; mean SD) followed an 8 week weight loss regime (2 meal replacements daily) followed by a carbohydrate (< 120 g/day) or fat restricted (< 50 g/day) weight maintenance regime for 6 months. Both dietary groups were followed up monthly and received advice on reducing the glycemic index and saturated fat content of their diet.
