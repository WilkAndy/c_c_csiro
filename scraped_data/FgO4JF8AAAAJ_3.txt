Objective: The objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared energy-restricted, isocaloric, high-protein, low-fat (HP) diets with standard-protein, low-fat (SP) diets on weight loss, body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), satiety and appetite, and cardiometabolic risk factors. Design: Systematic searches were conducted by using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify weight-loss trials that compared isocalorically prescribed diets matched for fat intake but that differed in protein and carbohydrate intakes in participants aged \u226518 y. Twenty-four trials that included 1063 individuals satisfied the inclusion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 624, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10387007488849401634", "cites_id": ["10387007488849401634"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/96/6/1281/4571449", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ItcwREcQJpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 28, "2014": 52, "2015": 64, "2016": 63, "2017": 65, "2018": 67, "2019": 44, "2020": 56, "2021": 71, "2022": 58, "2023": 16}}
