Objectives-To determine whether a 1g/d target intake for VLComega3 can be sustained using omega3 enriched processed foods; and if regular consumption of these foods can improve CV health. Design-Overweight volunteers with high blood lipids were enrolled in a dietary intervention trial in Adelaide (n= 50) and Perth (n= 44) and were randomised to eat 8 serves/day from a selection of omega3 enriched foods (about 125mg/serve) or matching control foods, which were substituted for equivalent foods in their regular diet. Outcomes-VLC (3 intake estimated by food compliance questionnaires was slightly below target (750mg/day) but DHA and total VLC omega3 content of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1918046198416984998", "cites_id": ["1918046198416984998"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:70cff743-7142-4972-896d-218fea765b40", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pstu79pEnhoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
