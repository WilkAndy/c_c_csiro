However, this statement is consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Australian Adults (2) and the World Health Organization Report 916 (3) which discusses energy balance and energy density as factors in the incidence of overweight and obesity.The essence of the disagreement is that the statement that dietary fat is not independently related to obesity is a moot point. In fact the article appears to agree that dietary fat exerts its effects through an increased energy intake rather than some other intrinsic effect of fat on energy metabolism. It is likely that the difference of opinion in regard to the policy paper is due to a misunderstanding as to how the document was planned to be used."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:W26WQ4UGDhEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13507309097112919880", "cites_id": ["13507309097112919880"], "pub_url": "https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA112985066&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=14466368&p=HRCA&sw=w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SF_RHA-ac7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
