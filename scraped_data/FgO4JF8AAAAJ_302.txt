CRP is positively associated with body mass index (BMI). In this study, we investigated the effects of dynamic weight loss on CRP in 83 healthy, obese women (mean BMI, 33.8+-0.4 kg/m2; range, 28.2 to 43.8 kg/m2). Subjects were placed on very-low-fat, energy-restricted diets (5700 kJ, 15% fat) for 12 weeks. Weight, waist and hip circumferences, plasma lipids, glucose, and CRP were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. CRP was positively associated with BMI (r=0.281, P=0.01) and waist circumference (r=0.278, P=0.01) but was not related to other atherosclerosis risk factors. BMI was significantly different between groups split above or below the median for CRP (34.8+-0.6 kg/m2 vs 33.0+-0.5 kg/m2, P=0.02). After 12 weeks, weight loss was 7.9+-0.3 kg.
