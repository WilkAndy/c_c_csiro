While attentional tasks have been widely investigated, there are limited data on more complex tasks, such as executive functioning during nightwork. Workers often need to rapidly shift between tasks, adapting to new and complex situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of nightwork on executive functioning.Healthy, non-shift working individuals (N=8; 5F, 24.8\u00b15.0y) participated in a 7-day live-in laboratory study. Participants underwent an 8h TIB baseline sleep, followed by 4 consecutive simulated nightshifts with 7h TIB sleep during the day and an 8h TIB recovery sleep. Participants were assessed for executive function at 2000h, 2200h, 0100h and 0400h. Executive functioning was assessed with a mental flexibility switching task where a 3D rotation and math task were displayed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:MhMRrlfrL94C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article-abstract/2/Supplement_1/A34/6383362", "cites_per_year": {}}
