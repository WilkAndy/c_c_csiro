We investigated eliminating or reducing the amount of food consumed during simulated nightwork as a countermeasure to reduce the impact of circadian disruption on glucose metabolism. N=52 healthy, non-shiftworking participants (24.4\u00b14.9 years; 26 Females; BMI 23.8\u00b12.5kg/m2) underwent a 7-day laboratory protocol with an 8h TIB baseline sleep, followed by 4 simulated nightshifts with 7h TIB daytime sleep and an 8h TIB recovery sleep in groups of 4 participants. Each group was randomly assigned to a meal-at-midnight (n=17, 30% energy requirements), snack-at-midnight (n=16, 10% energy requirements) or no-eating-at-midnight (n=19) condition. Total 24h energy and macronutrient intake were constant across conditions. Standard oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted on day2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:sYcQaO0ItmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article-abstract/2/Supplement_1/A23/6383288", "cites_per_year": {}}
