The study\u2019s aim was to investigate the effect of plant sterols (PS) on lowering LDL-C and TG in individuals at risk for and with established T2DM.Methods: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study 161 individuals at risk of and with established T2DM consumed low-fat spreads without or with added PS (2 g/d) for 6 weeks. T2DM risk was assessed by the Australian Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK). Fasting total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, TG, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose and insulin were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks. Effects on postprandial blood lipids, glucose and insulin were measured in a sub-group of 48 individuals with T2DM after a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:xu-w60CxnpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(18)30923-7/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
