Mr Wilson pointed out that the only statistically significant differences in strength between the dietary treatments were for leg press 8RM and total 8RM, with the total 8RM being driven mainly by the difference in leg press 8RM, and that our conclusions should therefore be limited to changes in strength in the legs, although he suggested it is difficult to see how gains in strength might differ between upper and lower body.Mr Wilson is correct in that the most substantial difference in 8RM between the high soy protein group and the others did occur for the leg press exercise. This is perhaps not unexpected given that the lower body contains more muscle mass than the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:9AjqDp0R1qcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(16)30172-8/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:70PAk3wHXPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
