It may involve dysregulation of ghrelin, a hormone implicated in appetite regulation. The effect of diet composition on ghrelin is unclear. Overweight women with and without PCOS were randomized to a high-protein (40% carbohydrate, 30% protein; 10 PCOS, six non-PCOS) or standard protein diet (55% carbohydrate, 15% protein; 10 PCOS, six non-PCOS) for 12 wk of energy restriction and 4 wk of weight maintenance. Diet composition had no effect on fasting or postprandial ghrelin or measures of satiety. Non-PCOS subjects had a 70% higher fasting baseline ghrelin (P = 0.011), greater increase in fasting ghrelin (57.5 vs. 34.0%, P = 0.033), and greater maximal decrease in postprandial ghrelin after weight loss (\u2212144.1 \u00b1 58.4 vs. \u221228.9 \u00b1 14.2 pg/ml, P = 0.02) than subjects with PCOS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:wTlTSBh5aqwC", "num_citations": 227, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=706575191896489740", "cites_id": ["706575191896489740"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/89/7/3337/2844354", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DP8XuGRCzgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 12, "2007": 15, "2008": 20, "2009": 20, "2010": 12, "2011": 13, "2012": 12, "2013": 12, "2014": 6, "2015": 16, "2016": 3, "2017": 14, "2018": 7, "2019": 14, "2020": 7, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
