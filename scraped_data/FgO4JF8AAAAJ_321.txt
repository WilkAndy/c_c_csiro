However, it is unclear whether the cardiometabolic benefits including weight loss observed during the energy restriction period are maintained during energy-balance and weight maintenance. There is also a lack of evidence regarding the effect of pork-protein based diets on food cravings, cognitive function and psychological wellbeing in T2DM, despite the association with carbohydrate-food cravings and cognitive impairment and hyperglycaemia.Sixty one overweight/obese adults with T2DM were randomised to consume either a high pork-protein diet (HPP)(n= 32,~ 32% protein, 33% carbohydrate, 30% fat) or a lower porkprotein diet (LPP, n= 29,~ 22% protein, 51% carbohydrate, 22% fat) for 24 weeks with 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise weekly for the study duration. There was an initial 12-week weight loss phase followed by a 12-week weight maintenance phase. The primary outcome was glycaemic control as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included cardiometabolic risk factors (anthropometry and body composition, blood pressure, plasma lipids, glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein), food cravings, cognitive function (memory, psychomotor skill and executive function) and wellbeing. Outcomes were measured at baseline and the end of each weight loss and weight maintenance phase. Data was analysed as intention-to-treat using linear mixed effects \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:boGf3zyra0UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://porkcrc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3B-102-Final-Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ld6pM__iTbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
