The European pear (Pyrus communis) is the major pear of commerce in Australia with eight varieties available. While the Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) or \u201cNashi\u201d is mostly grown in Asia it has been produced commercially in Australia for over 25 years. European and Asian pears differ slightly in appearance, taste, texture as well as nutritional composition and hence may differ slightly for some health attributes. Pears have been used as a traditional folk remedy in China for more than 2000 years because of their supposed anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycemic, diuretic activities, cough relief and as a prophylactic agent for alcohol hangover. The various bioactive compounds in pears may contribute to these health outcomes. The apple & pear Industry have identified a need to understand the current status of relevant nutritional science and evidence for pears to improve awareness of their health benefits.Aim:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:sK9NQJKSZRcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://australianpears.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pears-Health-Study-AP15010-Final-Report-Complete.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qvq-Eix8Y0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
