Overweight/obese adults (n = 61, BMI 33.5 \u00b1 4.8kgm2, aged 37 \u2013 67 years) with T2DM were randomized to a hypocaloric HP diet (38% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 29% fat) or an isocaloric HC diet (53%,21%,23%) for 12 weeks, after which energy was adjusted to maintain a stable weight for a further 12 weeks. Outcomes were measured at baseline and the end of each phase.  Forty four participants completed the study (HP n=23, HC n=21). Following weight loss, there were significant (p<0.05) reductions in body mass (\u20107.7 \u00b1 4.0kg), waist circumference (\u20107.6 \u00b1 4.5cm), blood pressure (\u20109.6/\u20107.2 \u00b1 9.7/6.1mmHg), HbA1c (\u20101.4 \u00b1 1.1%), fasting glucose (\u20102.5 \u00b1 2.8mmol/L), fasting insulin (\u20108.5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:7eciy3tyNvQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.29.1_supplement.117.8", "cites_per_year": {}}
