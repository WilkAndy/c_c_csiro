The first study (RIRDC Publication No. 14/073) was based on Australian food intake data for 1995/1996. The second assessment, now being reported, utilizes food intake data for 2011/2012 collected as part of the Australian Health Survey (ABS 4364 2012b). The availability of the second dataset enables change in the Australian food system from 1995 to 2011 to be evaluated and future projections revised.Australia is a food trading nation with a food system that is complex and dynamic. The food supply is diverse, making healthy diets and a wide range of food options possible. Australia is also considered to have a relatively high level of food security, ranking 15th in a recent assessment of 109 nations (EIU 2014)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:vkG2KsohqNgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/15-062.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GPc47ybyd2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
