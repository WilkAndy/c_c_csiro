After a four-week run-in on a high saturated fat (SFA) diet (1540 kcal/day, 17% SFA), the free-living subjects were randomly assigned to either a high- (75 GI units) or low- (43 GI units) GI diet (1440 kcal/day, 60% carbohydrate, 5% SFA) for eight weeks. Weight, serum lipids, plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin were measured every four weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also performed at baseline, weeks 4 and 12. From the baseline OGTT results subjects were divided \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4541894181622277207", "cites_id": ["4541894181622277207"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2002.10719204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V2QCt7EMCD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 26, "2004": 16, "2005": 18, "2006": 21, "2007": 14, "2008": 19, "2009": 11, "2010": 13, "2011": 9, "2012": 3, "2013": 10, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
