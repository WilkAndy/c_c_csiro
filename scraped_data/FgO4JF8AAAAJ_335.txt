There were no significant differences in folate intake or red cell folate in those with the PAV haplotype, relative to those without. Those with the PAV haplotype had significantly higher serum folate (17.95\u00b10.88 vs. 21.17\u00b11.42 nmol/L, p== 0.046).\u201cTasters\u201d consumed significantly less folate (436.7\u00b115.7 vs. 521.0\u00b140.2 mg/d, p= 0.021) and had lower serum (18.52\u00b10.08 vs. 22.34\u00b11.53 nmol/L, p= 0.024) and red cell folate (832.2\u00b132.7 vs. 973.4\u00b158.1 nmol/L, p= 0.030), compared to \u201cNon-tasters\u201d. Neither haplotype nor phenotype alone predicted AP risk.Conclusions: Folate status significantly varies with phenotype, but not haplotype, but neither adequately predicted AP. Phenotype may be modified by additional factors (genetic, epigenetic, sociocultural), which may influence the axis between diet and disease."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:2Km5FFimHwEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1211604.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
