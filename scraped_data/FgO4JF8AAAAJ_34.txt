Intraindividual variability was determined for eight subjects on 3 consecutive days after 14 d on a fixed diet. Coefficients of variation were 7.49 \u00b1 1.50%, 6.58 \u00b1 1.16%, and 4.58 \u00b1 0.77% for oxidation rate, lag time, and diene concentration, respectively. In the second study 12 normolipidemic men consumed a daily diet supplement containing 35 g linoleate-rich oil in one period and 35 g oleate-rich oil in the other period (2 \u00d7 3 wk crossover). LDL oxidized faster after the linoleate diet than after the oleate diet (x\u0304 \u00b1 SE: 16.42 \u00b1 0.85 and 13.16 \u00b1 0.68 nmol diene \u00b7 mg LDL protein\u22121 \u00b7 min\u22121, respectively, P < 0.02) and produced more conjugated diene (416 \u00b1 12.60 and 379.29 \u00b1 11.06 nmol/mg protein, respectively, P < 0.05) in proportion to the increase in LDL \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8346326215030718048", "cites_id": ["8346326215030718048"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/57/3/391/4715690", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YL5vyngb1HMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 11, "1995": 15, "1996": 15, "1997": 15, "1998": 11, "1999": 9, "2000": 17, "2001": 10, "2002": 13, "2003": 12, "2004": 9, "2005": 11, "2006": 10, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1}}
