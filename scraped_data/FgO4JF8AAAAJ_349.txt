Human consumption in all its forms contributes to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), their potential impact on global warming and ultimately climate change with its projected adverse impacts. However, the depletion of natural resources which in part are used to produce food may result in an untenable ecosystem for human survival in future generations. Both of these challenges dovetail to determine what will and will not be a sustainable system for human survival and wellbeing for future generations. This paper will make the case for reducing overall human consumption of nutrient poor foods, wasting less, and prioritising nutrient dense foods in amounts in accordance with dietary guidelines. This is argued as a means of achieving improved public health and lower environmental impacts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:lgavJseCKEcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/aeb4ba86addc6b8c1519252157417d40/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=54991", "cites_per_year": {}}
