Subjects were asked to maintain the same dietary pattern for a further 12 months of follow-up.The study was completed by 38 of the subjects, with equal dropouts in each group. At Week 64, weight reductions against baseline were \u22122.2\u00b11.1 kg (low protein) and \u22123.7\u00b11.0 kg (high protein), p<0.01, with no diet effect \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:vf0YIhSwahgC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12046190886930663061", "cites_id": ["12046190886930663061"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-004-1511-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lcYMyMmqLKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 14, "2008": 18, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 14, "2013": 20, "2014": 17, "2015": 9, "2016": 17, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 16, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
