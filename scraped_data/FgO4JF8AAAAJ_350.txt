Web-based programs can reduce in-person contact with participants yet, relatively little is understood regarding how these programs can be most efficacious.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine which factors predict self-reported retention to the dietary component of a web-based lifestyle program in order to inform improvements to future internet interventions.DesignAn interactive website was developed based on the CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet (TWD). Overweight/obese Australian adults registered for the 12-week online trial and received unguided access to an interactive website (n= 7929). 5152 registrants used the site with 413 (90.1% female) completing the evaluation survey.
