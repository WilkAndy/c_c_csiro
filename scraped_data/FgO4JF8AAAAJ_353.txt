Body weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed at baseline and after one year.68 participants completed the study (HP n=33; SP n=35). Both groups experienced similar reductions in body weight (HP \u221212.3\u00b18.0 kg [\u221212%]; SP \u221210.9\u00b18.6 kg [\u221211%]) and fat mass (HP \u2212 9.9\u00b16.0 kg [\u221227%]; SP \u22127.3\u00b15.8 kg [\u221222%]), P>0.11 time x group. Participants who consumed the HP diet lost less fat free mass (\u22122.6\u00b13.7 kg [\u22124%] vs. \u22123.8\u00b14.7 kg [\u22126 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.26.1_supplement.387.2", "cites_per_year": {}}
