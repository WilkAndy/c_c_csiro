Methods: Age, weight and body mass index (BMI)-matched women with (n= 14) and without (n= 13) PCOS (age 34.3\u00b15.7 years, weight 94.1\u00b117.5 kg, BMI 35.1\u00b15.2 kg/m2) followed an 8 week weight loss regime (5208.4\u00b1740.3 kJ/day). Primary outcome measures were the novel cardiovascular risk factors plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), inter-cellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM). Results: Equivalent reductions in weight (\u2212 4.2\u00b14.0 kg) and waist circumference (\u2212 7.0\u00b15.2 cm) occurred for women with and without PCOS. Compared to controls, women with PCOS had elevated PAI-1 (baseline 2.5\u00b10.9 vs 1.8\u00b10.7 ng/mL p= 0.034, post-weight loss 2.3\u00b10.7 vs 1.7\u00b10.6 ng/mL p= 0.047), ICAM (baseline 1.9\u00b10.7 vs 1.5\u00b10.6 ng/mL p= 0.047, post-weight loss 1.7\u00b10.5 vs 1.4\u00b10.4 ng/mL p= 0.032) and VCAM (post-weight loss 11.9\u00b12.6 vs 9.5\u00b11.7 ng/mL p= 0.009). Following weight loss there were equivalent reductions in ICAM (\u2212 0.2\u00b10.3 ng/mL, p= 0.040) and VCAM (\u2212 0.8\u00b11.8 ng/mL, p= 0.029) for women with and without PCOS. PAI-1 did not change with weight loss (p= 0.337) for either women with or without PCOS. Conclusions: We report for the first time that while modest weight loss equivalently reduces ICAM and VCAM in overweight women with and without PCOS, novel cardiovascular risk factors (PAI-1, ICAM and VCAM) remain elevated compared to controls following weight loss. Women with PCOS have significantly higher levels \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:1GbOEZ86UTAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/the-effect-of-weight-loss-on-novel-cardiovascular-risk-factors-in", "cites_per_year": {}}
