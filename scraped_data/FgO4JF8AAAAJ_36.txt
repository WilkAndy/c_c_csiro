Objective: The objective was to determine the efficacy of a higher protein intake on the maintenance of weight loss after 64 wk of follow-up. Design: Seventy-nine healthy women with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of 49 \u00b1 9 y and a body mass index (in kg/m2) of 32.8 \u00b1 3.5 completed an intensive 12-wk weight-loss program and 52 wk of follow-up to compare the effects on weight-loss maintenance of a high-protein (HP) diet (34% of energy) or a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet (64% of energy). Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) weight loss was not significantly different between groups: (HP: 4.6 \u00b1 5.5 kg; HC: 4.4 \u00b1 6.1 kg). Protein intake (g) from dietary records at 64 wk was directly related to weight loss (P < 0.0001), accounting for 15% of the variance.
