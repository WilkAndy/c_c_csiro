However, higher protein diets have been typically associated with increased consumption of red meat, of which there is some evidence, albeit not conclusive that higher consumption of red meat may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and iron intake may be related to the development of type 2 diabetes. Some preliminary evidence also exists suggesting that thiamine deficiency may be associated with micro-vascular complications and low thiamine concentrations have been reported in diabetes and thiamine intake is lower on low carbohydrate diets. Therefore, the incorporation of pork protein into a higher protein dietary plan maybe a valuable alternative option to optimise thiamine intake and status in type 2 diabetes. In addition, studies to date in type 2 diabetes have evaluated the effects of a higher protein diet without the incorporation of exercise training as a comprehensive lifestyle plan. This clinical trial assessed the efficacy of a comprehensive 16-week weight reduction program high in pork with resistance exercise in improving thiamine concentrations, diabetes control and markers of cardiovascular disease risk."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:RLNBYFRFzK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://porkcrc.com.au/3A-107-Final_Project_Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QYCGy54TGWYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
