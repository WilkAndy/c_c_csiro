To examine variation in fecal variables, especially butyrate, among individuals and the response to these fibers, a randomized cross-over study was conducted that compared the effects of foods supplying 25 g of NSP or 25 g of NSP plus 22 g of RS/d over 4 wk in 46 healthy adults (16 males, 30 females; age 31\u201366 y). Fecal SCFA levels varied widely among participants at entry (butyrate concentrations: 3.5\u201332.6 mmol/kg; butyrate excretions: 0.3\u201318.2 mmol/48 h). BMI explained 27% of inter-individual butyrate variation, whereas protein, starch, carbohydrate, fiber, and fat intake explained up to 16, 6, 2, 4, and 2% of butyrate variation, respectively. Overall, acetate, butyrate, and total SCFA concentrations were higher when participants consumed RS compared \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 214, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10505304103968710837", "cites_id": ["10505304103968710837"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/141/5/883/4600324", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tSCCTmxWypEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 9, "2013": 17, "2014": 14, "2015": 17, "2016": 15, "2017": 16, "2018": 15, "2019": 12, "2020": 28, "2021": 27, "2022": 29, "2023": 13}}
