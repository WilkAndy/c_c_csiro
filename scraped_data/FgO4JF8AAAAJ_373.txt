Conclusion-CARB-E did not optimise blood glucose control as assessed by postprandial peaks whereas CARB-L provided the most favourable postprandial profile."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:y2egTTA-ddEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/2dbacd26e9943a667c10a35e77eacbad/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=45812", "cites_per_year": {}}
