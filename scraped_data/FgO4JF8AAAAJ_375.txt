The effects of treatment on energy intake and appetite hormones were independent of body weight status, despite overall higher GLP-1 and lower ghrelin concentrations in overweight/obese subjects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:BbFSz4cl-9EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/ff2ea7a83b7a0f27b3f5578e5ad254a5/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=45812", "cites_per_year": {}}
