Results from this study suggest that HP and HC weight loss diets may modify the carcinogenic profile of the bowel contents such that weight loss may exert a beneficial effect by reducing genotoxic load in the short term; however these results require verification against a non-weight loss control."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:u2ZU9_Z9f7QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/ff2ea7a83b7a0f2759d53c4b943a9135/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=45812", "cites_per_year": {}}
