Approximately 45% energy was provided as key foods which differed in published GI values and specifically excluded legumes. Dietary fibre intake was> 30 g/d on each diet. At the end of each dietary intervention, we measured fasting plasma lipids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:yREA-gn6pYwC", "num_citations": 213, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12021980017396413699", "cites_id": ["12021980017396413699"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/1600779", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A_XBcSGn1qYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 10, "2002": 20, "2003": 18, "2004": 18, "2005": 15, "2006": 24, "2007": 11, "2008": 15, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 12, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
