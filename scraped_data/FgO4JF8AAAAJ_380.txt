Objective-Our aims were to investigate 1) whether a moderate energy restriction diet (7000kJ) over 12 weeks, altered IGF-I and-II, IGFBP-2 and IGF-II receptor concentration in obese men, and 2) whether a high protein diet, high in red meat (HP) affected IGF-I and-II, IGFBP-2 and IGF-II receptor concentration to a similar extent as a high carbohydrate diet (HC)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:tFsQzMahPQAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/95159752a9e4ec9994f072d57b94e58c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=45812", "cites_per_year": {}}
