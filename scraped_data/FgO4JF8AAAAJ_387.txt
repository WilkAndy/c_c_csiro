OBJECTIVE: The effect of an LC on markers of endothelial function and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was compared with that of an isocaloric high-carbohydrate, low-saturated-fat diet (HC). DESIGN: FMD and markers of endothelial function (n= 70) and CVD risk were measured before and after 8 wk of weight loss. Ninety-nine subjects aged 50.0+/-8.3 y with a body mass index (in kg/m2) of 33.7+/-4.1 completed the study. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) FMD did not change significantly (P= 0.55) with either diet. Pulse wave velocity improved with both diets (P< 0.01).
