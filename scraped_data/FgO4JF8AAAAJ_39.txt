The objective of this study was to compare, under isocaloric conditions, the effects of a VLCARB to 2 low saturated fat high carbohydrate diets on body composition and cardiovascular risk.Eighty three subjects, 48 \u00b1 8 y, total cholesterol 5.9 \u00b1 1.0 mmol/L, BMI 33 \u00b1 3 kg/m2 were randomly allocated to one of 3 isocaloric weight loss diets (6 MJ) for 8 weeks and on the same diets in energy balance for 4 weeks: Very Low Fat (VLF) (CHO:Fat:Protein; %SF = 70:10:20; 3%), High Unsaturated Fat (HUF) = (50:30:20; 6%), VLCARB (4:61:35; 20%)Percent fat mass loss was not different between diets VLCARB -4.5 \u00b1 0.5, VLF-4.0 \u00b1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 209, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11925421253414842388", "cites_id": ["11925421253414842388"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1743-7075-3-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FHCvRnKbf6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 17, "2009": 8, "2010": 12, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
