During each cell division telomere is lost; when telomeres become too short the cell senesces. Shortened telomeres cause genome instability and have been observed in many carcinomas. Objective\u2013The purpose of this study was to investigate the telomere length of mid-rectal biopsy samples and to determine if weight-loss influences telomere length.Design\u2013Mid-rectal biopsies were collected by sigmoidoscopy forceps. Appropriate consent was obtained from volunteers. Telomere length was measured by determining the number of TTAGGG hexamer repeats using quantitative real-time PCR. We modified the Cawthon assay to obtain an absolute measurement of telomeric repeats.
