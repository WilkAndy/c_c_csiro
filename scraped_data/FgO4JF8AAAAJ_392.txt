The mechanisms underlying this association are unclear, but may relate to structural and pressure changes within the left atrium (LA). We compared LA size and LA pressure (LAP) in obese diabetic men in sinus rhythm, to non-diabetic non-obese controls. We also assessed whether weight loss in our diabetic cohort reduced LA size and LAP, potentially reducing AF risk.Methods: Twenty-one obese type-2 diabetic men (body mass index (BMI) 34.2 (32.5\u201337.4); fasting glucose (FG) 7.7 (6.4\u201311.5); HbA1C 6.1 (5.9\u20137.8)) underwent echocardiography before and after an 8-week 800 cal/day weight-loss programme. LA area was measured by planimetry. Transmitral E-wave velocity (E) and tissue Doppler mitral annular relaxation velocity (E m) was measured and E/E m ratio calculated to estimate mean LAP. The results were compared against \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.heartlungcirc.org/article/S1443-9506(08)00502-7/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
