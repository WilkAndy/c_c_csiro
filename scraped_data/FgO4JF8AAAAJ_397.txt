Design\u2013We randomised 123 overweight/obese men to one of two parallel isocaloric weight loss diets-HP (n= 61) and HC (n= 62). Blood samples, 24 hr urine, 24 hr faecal samples and rectal biopsies were collected at baseline, wk 12 and at wk 52. Diets were HP: 6.9\u00b10.7 (SD) MJ, protein 33\u00b13% en (energy), carbohydrate 37\u00b14% en, fat 27\u00b13% en, fibre 30\u00b16 g/day; red meat 300 g 4 times per wk and HC: 6.7\u00b10.6 MJ, protein 21\u00b12% en, carbohydrate 51\u00b14% en, fat 25\u00b14% en, fibre 38\u00b14 g/day; red meat< 100 g per wk.Outcomes\u2013Completers (wk 12 n= 111; wk 52 n= 65) had similar weight loss on both diets: wk 12: 8.4\u00b13.4%; wk 52: 10.8\u00b16.5%. Faecal weight, pH, moisture, short chain fatty acids, phenol/p-cresol excretion were not significantly different between HP and HC at wk 12 or wk 52. Faecal water genotoxicity did not differ by diet at wk 12 (P> 0.1) or wk 52 (P> 0.4). In rectal tissue cells, telomere length, a measure of genome stability, increased on HP and HC at wk 12 and wk 52 (P< 0.0001). Increase in telomere length correlated with weight loss r= 0.697, P< 0.01. Bone mineral density at wk 52 decreased less on HP than HC (P= 0.002). Creatinine clearance declined on both diets at wk 12 but did not differ by diet and at wk 52 was not different from baseline (P< 0.01).
