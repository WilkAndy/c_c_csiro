Design\u2013Randomised parallel design of two energy restricted diets in an outpatient setting. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD), fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, adiponectin and adhesion molecules were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of weight loss.Outcomes\u201380 subjects (BMI> 27,< 40 kg/m2) were randomised to a low carbohydrate-high saturated fat (LC) or a high carbohydrate-low saturated fat diet (LF). FMD did not change on either diet, 5.3\u00b13.3 to 5.3\u00b13.3%(LC) and 6.2\u00b13.7 to 6.3\u00b14.3%(LF) despite weight loss of 8% and 7%, LC and LF respectively.
