Objective: The objective was to compare the effects of 2 weight-loss diets differing in protein-to-carbohydrate ratio on body composition, glucose and lipid metabolism, and markers of bone turnover. Design: A parallel design included either a high-protein diet of meat, poultry, and dairy foods (HP diet: 27% of energy as protein, 44% as carbohydrate, and 29% as fat) or a standard-protein diet low in those foods (SP diet: 16% of energy as protein, 57% as carbohydrate, and 27% as fat) during 12 wk of energy restriction (6\u20136.3 MJ/d) and 4 wk of energy balance (\u22488.2 MJ/d). Fifty-seven overweight volunteers with fasting insulin concentrations > 12 mU/L completed the study. Results: Weight loss (7.9 \u00b1 0.5 kg) and total fat loss (6.9 \u00b1 0.4 kg) did \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 602, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13838516913752033972", "cites_id": ["13838516913752033972"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/78/1/31/4689894", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tMpsPtBJDMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 32, "2005": 33, "2006": 45, "2007": 45, "2008": 31, "2009": 27, "2010": 35, "2011": 34, "2012": 52, "2013": 37, "2014": 32, "2015": 22, "2016": 38, "2017": 26, "2018": 17, "2019": 21, "2020": 16, "2021": 24, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
