Each diet was consumed for 4 wk in random order and in a crossover fashion. Overall, the diets were high in carbohydrate (> 55% of energy) and low in fat (< 30% of energy); the amount of resistant starch in the foods containing high-amylose starch was 17 g in women and 25 g in men. The metabolic effects of specific starches on plasma lipids, fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin profiles, and bowel function were assessed at the end of each intervention. Plasma triacylglycerols (triglycerides) were significantly lower after the oat bran diet than after the other two diets (P < 0.02). No other effects on fasting plasma lipids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 206, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1736873871464517444", "cites_id": ["1736873871464517444"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/64/6/944/4655257", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RM9McJWdGhgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 12, "2004": 14, "2005": 7, "2006": 16, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 15, "2010": 8, "2011": 12, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 13, "2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
