Androgen excess and hyperinsulinemia are key contributing features that are exacerbated by obesity. Both weight reduction and increases in physical activity are highly effective in increasing insulin sensitivity but underutilized in clinical practice as evidence on effective strategies to achieve this are lacking. The use of metformin is effective in restoring ovulatory function through improvement in insulin sensitivity, possibly also mediated by weight loss. Orlistat and sibutramine have also been shown to assist in weight loss and thereby restore reproductive function. In the morbidly obese with PCOS, bariatric surgery has been shown to achieve substantial weight loss and to be effective in improving fertility. The literature on effective diet and exercise programs for PCOS has been sparse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59745-179-6_39", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FXDQWKDMy0gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
