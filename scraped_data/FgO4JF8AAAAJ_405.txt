All other polysaccharides (non-starch polysaccharides, NSP; major components of dietary fibre) resist human digestion. High fibre foods are effective in controlling constipation and increased fibre consumption is thought to protect against colo-rectal cancer. While the importance of fibre is recognised, evidence is emerging that starches which are digested less efficiently by human small intestinal enzymes may be even more important. The significance of fibre arose from population studies showing that groups who ate unrefined foods had lower risk of diseases associated with the refined products consumed by affluent ones. However, it has emerged that the former have quite low fibre intakes but eat large amounts of starch and relatively small quantities of animal products (1). Further, their cooking practices favoured the generation of resistant starch (RS) through retrogradation. RS is that fraction of starch (and products of starch digestion) which escapes into the large bowel of healthy humans and retrogradation is a recrystallization of starch after gelatinisation giving more RS. RS is metabolised by the colonic microflora generating short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which promote several aspects of visceral function (2). RS is a mass term, reflecting the extent of small intestinal starch digestion. Glycaemic response (GR) applied to starch, describes measures of the rate of its small intestinal digestion. Slowing this process gives a lower glycaemic index (GI) and reduced demand for insulin and is of value in controlling diabetes. GR and RS are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:PflRiyi98mgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/33351741/S43.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1Je3phaNCWkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
