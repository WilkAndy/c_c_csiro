Estimates of protein requirement are based on several assumptions the relevance of which can be challenged for populations consuming western diets.Review\u2013The most recent Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand (1) list the RDI for men 19-70 years as 64g per day and for women as 46 g/day with 25% increases in individuals> 70 years. These recommendations are based on reference body weights 76 kg and 57 kg for men and women respectively. These values rely heavily on the meta-analysis by Rand et al (2) based on 19 nitrogen balance studies in 235 individuals. This study provided estimated average requirements (EAR) and 97.5 th percentile (RDI) of protein intakes for healthy adults at 0.65 and 0.83 g good-quality protein per kilogram per day, respectively. These values were not different for adult age groups, sex, or diet groups although the data was not powered to detect less than very major differences. Millward (3) argues that the adequacy of protein and amino acid intakes cannot be discussed separately from the adequacy of energy intake."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:4kG_yR6n1dAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=0460e4b046c3750d553e53685d19d58234a790fc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yCZKRhRWzz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
