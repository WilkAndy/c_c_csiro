It is less clear whether the macronutrient composition of individual foods as snacks have any meaningful impact on these metabolic parameters and satiety. Objective--To determine whether the consumption of high protein snack bars (800KJ)(HP) can make a meaningful impact on reducing food intake and diurnal glucose and insulin patterns compared to a conventional isocaloric high fat high refined carbohydrate snack bar (HFC) in overweight women. Study Design--Twenty three women aged 42\u00b18y (mean\u00b1SD) and BMI 30\u00b14kg/m\u00b2 were randomized in a single blind cross over study with 2 treatments: high protein snack bar consumed mid morning and mid afternoon compared with an isocaloric high fat snack bar mid morning and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:mCmIWee0OMYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601641&h=NvdQruQggp2DxVFmqzWXNCseHkhQHB4eqf9mbSuCGNOoDtdEdxwdUsDf96kz%2BszFN6%2FKWmJwWmUyvZxV89PXyA%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
