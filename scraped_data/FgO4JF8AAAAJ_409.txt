Objective--To compare, under isocaloric conditions, the effects of VLCARB and low fat high carbohydrate test meals on post prandial glucose and insulin responses before and after weight loss on these dietary patterns. Study Design--Eighty three subjects,(mean\u00b1SD) 48\u00b18y, total cholesterol 5.9\u00b11.0 mmol/L, BMI 33\u00b13kg/m\u00b2 were randomly allocated to one of 3 isocaloric weight loss diets (6MJ) for 8 weeks and on the same diets in energy balance for 4 weeks. Diets were Very Low Fat (VLF)(10% fat, 3% saturated fat), Low Fat High Unsaturated Fat (HUF)(30% fat, 6% saturated fat) and VLCARB (61% fat, 20% saturated; 4% carbohydrate). Isocaloric test meals (MTT) of the respective dietary compositions as well as a 75g oral glucose challenge (GTT) were performed over 3 hours at the beginning and end of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:t5t9nzMiR1QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09647058&AN=35601640&h=Rgmyj%2FACUa7eMTfOKfKNIRimuEgKj2pJn2YII3HMmp4owLzup6p%2Bi3pUoNOEngausznZ21%2FNaB81ttvmF%2F0ztA%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
