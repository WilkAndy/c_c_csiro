We performed a randomized 12-wk parallel design study of two 6000-kJ diets: 35% energy from fat (high monounsaturated fat diet, HIMO), or 12% energy from fat (very low-fat diet, VLF) to determine whether this also occurred in nondiabetic women. Body fat distribution, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and fasting serum lipids were measured at wk 0 and 12 in 62 women (BMI > 27 kg/m2). Weight loss (9.5 +/- 2.4 vs. 9.4 +/- 3.4 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) and total fat loss (6.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 6.3 +/- 2.7 kg, VLF vs. HIMO) did not differ in the groups. There was a diet X menopausal status interaction in lean mass changes (P 0.005) such that in premenopausal women, HIMO produced a lower loss of lean mass than the low-fat diet (0.4 +/- 2.3 vs. 2.9 +/- 2.7 kg, P = 0.006) with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:xyKys1DtkaQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8391211346079860058&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
