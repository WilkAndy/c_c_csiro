Subjects consumed 300 ml/d of placebo or PSteE-milk (2.0 g plant sterols/d) alone or combined with 25 g/d of placebo or PSteE-spread. Study two was a fully randomised, double blind crossover design with 3 phases of 3-week interventions. Subjects consumed 2 portions (150 g tubs each) of placebo, PSteE-yoghurt (1.8 g plant sterols/d) or PStaE-yoghurt (1.7 g plant stanols/d). In study one 39 subjects (21 men and 18 women) and in study two 40 subjects (17 men and 23 women) completed the dietary intervention.ResultsIn study one, PSteE-milk and PSteE-spread were equally efficacious in lowering total and LDL-cholesterol as compared to placebo by 6-8% and 8-10%, respectively. No significant additional cholesterol-lowering was observed with the combination of PSteE-milk and PSteE-spread (4 g plant sterols/d). PSteE-enriched milk and the combination of PSteE-enriched milk plus spread both lowered lipid-adjusted serum beta-carotene concentrations by 10-14% (P < 0.02),while the PSteE-rich spread alone did not significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:PLWDSxI5WzYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/9444", "cites_per_year": {}}
