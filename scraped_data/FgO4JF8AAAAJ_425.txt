We compared meal replacements with a structured weight-reduction diet in overweight/obese Australians with raised triglycerides. In a randomized parallel design, 2 groups (meal replacement (MR) and control (C)) of 66 matched subjects underwent a 6000 U intervention for 3 mo (stage 1) and a further 3 mo (stage 2). The groups were provided oral and written information. The C group was supplied with shopping vouchers and followed a low fat/energy diet. The MR group was supplied with Slim-Fast(TM) products for 2 meals (1800 kJ) and consumed a low-fat evening meal.
