It may involve dysregulation of ghrelin, a hormone implicated in appetite regulation. The effect of diet composition on ghrelin is unclear. Overweight women with and without PCOS were randomized to a high-protein (40% carbohydrate, 30% protein; 10 PCOS, six non-PCOS) or standard protein diet (55% carbohydrate, 15% protein; 10 PCOS, six non-PCOS) for 12 wk of energy restriction and 4 wk of weight maintenance. Diet composition had no effect on fasting or postprandial ghrelin or measures of satiety. Non-PCOS subjects had a 70% higher fasting baseline ghrelin (P=0.011), greater increase in fasting ghrelin (57.5 vs. 34.0%, P=0.033), and greater maximal decrease in postprandial ghrelin after weight loss (144.1+/-58.4 vs. -28.9+/-14.2 pg/ml, P=0.02) than subjects with PCOS.
