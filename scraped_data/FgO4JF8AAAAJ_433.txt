In addition, the TEF to an HP or LP meal was determined for 3 h, at baseline and at week 16.ResultsAfter 16 weeks, weight loss was similar in response to each diet; the overall decrease was 7.9+/-0.6 kg (P<0.001), of which 6.8+/-0.5 kg was fat (P<0.001). REE fell similarly with each diet; the overall decrease was 719+/-106 kJ/day (P<0.001). The TEF was 2% greater after the HP than after the LP meal at baseline (P<0.01) and 0.8% greater at week 16 (P=0.35). After 16 weeks, the TEF was not reduced in either dietary group. There was no change in TEE after 16 weeks.ConclusionIn subjects with hyperinsulinemia an energy-restrictive diet containing an increased protein-to-carbohydrate ratio does not enhance weight loss or significantly affect energy expenditure \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:tntj4plCNvAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/38976", "cites_per_year": {}}
