A subset of these subjects (211 females and 45 males), were placed on a 30% energy restricted diet (6200 kJ) for 12 weeks. Subjects were assessed every 2 weeks and changes in body weight, waist circumference and BMI were used as determinants of weight loss. Fasting plasma was analysed for glucose, insulin, lipids and free fatty acids. 64% of subjects were GG homozygotes, 31% were AG heterozygotes and 5% were AA homozygotes. There was no significant difference between the allele frequency in healthy subjects (0.21) and type 2 diabetic patients (0.24). The presence of the \u2212308 A/G polymorphism did not significantly influence initial BMI, the amount of weight lost (GG, 8.1\u00b10.65 kg, AG, 6.9\u00b10.77 kg, AA, 7.6\u00b10.12 kg), waist circumference or any metabolic variable. The AA variant at position \u2212308 in the promoter region of the TNF\u03b1 gene does not influence the amount of weight lost in overweight and obese men and women on a 30% energy restricted diet."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:6ftYtcnYaCAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/2972", "cites_per_year": {}}
