Plant sterols ((-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol) are more abundant in nature and plant stanols ((-sitostanol) are the hydrogenated form of plant sterols. Most of our dietary intake of phytosterols (200-400mg/day) is in the form of plant sterols. Therapeutic effects in terms of cholesterol lowering occur in doses from 1g-3g/day and efficacy has been shown in both people on low or high fat diets as well as in those with high or normal plasma cholesterol levels. Their mechanism of action derived from their structural similarity to dietary cholesterol such that they inhibit dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption.Plant sterols and stanols are generally estereified to improve their lipid solubility so they can be incorporated into foods \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:znQEAXyEQe8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10575019967801802850&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YkB9waEEwpIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
