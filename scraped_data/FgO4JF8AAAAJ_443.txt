One previous study in subjects with type 2 diabetes has shown that replacing protein for carbohydrate in a weight loss diet resulted in greater abdominal fat loss in women (1). Objective: To compare two weight loss diets differing in carbohydrate/protein ratio on body composition, glucose and lipid metabolism and markers of bone turnover in subjects with elevated plasma insulin. Design: Parallel design with interventions either a high protein diet from meat, poultry and dairy foods (HP; 27% of energy as protein, 44% carbohydrate) or a standard protein diet low in meat, poultry and dairy foods (SP; 16% energy as protein, 57% carbohydrate) during 12 weeks of energy restriction (6.5 MJ/day) and 4 weeks of energy balance (8.2 MJ/day).
