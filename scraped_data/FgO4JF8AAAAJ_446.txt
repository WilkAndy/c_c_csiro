Attitudinal research indicates that fat consumption is associated with weight gain and heart disease and hence fat restriction is perceived as beneficial (1). Knowledge of low fat strategies for food selection and preparation suggest that the \u2018low fat\u2019message has been successfully communicated. However, there is confusion and hence little consideration of type of fat. The Heart Foundation (HF) policy on dietary fat and cardiovascular disease (CVD), based on a rigorous review of the scientific evidence, places greater emphasis on type of fat. In particular, reducing saturated fatty acid (SAFA) and increasing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)(2). Little evidence was found to support a recommendation for total fat and CVD. A subsequent HF review on the relationship between dietary fat and body weight found that energy density, rather than fat, is a major \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/10/4/88.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
