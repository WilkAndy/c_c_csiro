In previous cross-sectional studies we had observed a significant negative correlation between chromosome damage (measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay) in lymphocytes and plasma vitamin B12 in subjects who were healthy and not vitamin B12 or folate deficient.\u201d Furthermore the micronucleus index was positively correlated with plasma homocysteine.\u201d These data suggested that above average intakes of folate and vitamin B12 may be required to minimise DNA damage rateS.We therefore performed a cross-sectional study (N= 49 males, 57 females) and a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled dietary intervention study (N= 31, 32 per group) to determine the effect of folate and vitamin B12 (B12) supplementation on DNA damage (micronucleus formation and DNA methylation) and plasma homocysteine (HC) in young Australian adults aged 18\u201332 years. None of the volunteers were folate deficient (ie red cell folate"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:q2fMW1XeUkEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1bijAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA168&dq=info:NA_LV4gSF60J:scholar.google.com&ots=1XUlzwcDxP&sig=e53mlAFkEkmbQvJezeY0iMOoDCE", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NA_LV4gSF60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
