In previous cross-sectional studies we had observed a significant negative correlation between chromosome damage (measured using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay) in lymphocytes and plasma vitamin B12 in subjects who were healthy and not vitamin B12 or folate deficient. 3 Furthermore the micronucleus index was positively correlated with plasma homocysteine. 3 These data suggested that above average intakes of folate and vitamin B12 may be required to minimise DNA damage rates.We therefore performed a cross-sectional study (N= 49 males, 57 females) and a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled dietary intervention study (N= 31, 32 per group) to determine the effect of folate and vitamin B12 (B12) supplementation on DNA damage (micronucleus formation and DNA methylation) and plasma homocysteine (HC) in young Australian adults aged 18-32 years. None of the volunteers were folate deficient (ie red cell folate< 136 nmoll-\u00b9) and only 4.4%(all females) were vitamin B12 deficient (ie serum B12< 150 pmol1-1). The cross-sectional study showed that (a) the frequency of micronucleated (MNed) cells was positively correlated with plasma HC in males (R= 0.293, P< 0.05) and (b) in females MNed cell frequency was negatively correlated with serum B12 (R=-0.359, P< 0.01) but (c) there was no significant correlation between micronucleus index and folate status. The results also showed that the level of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:caH3YpRUWsIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4931754754498249673&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yUM21dEccUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
