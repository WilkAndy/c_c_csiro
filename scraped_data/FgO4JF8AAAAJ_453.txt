Using novel milling technology it has become possible to isolate aleurone cells with sheared cell walls from wheat grain and to prepare a novel cereal product that has a natural folate level of approximately 500 ug (100g) T\u2019. We have therefore performed intervention trials in humans to assess the relative bioavailability of natural folate in cereal made from aleurone flour (ALF) and to determine whether such a cereal could produce a significant increment in blood folate status when consumed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1bijAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA165&dq=info:CGBET_3Z0BcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=1XUlzwcDyR&sig=jVcUj6vq24UgYrYV2hQw3tg8Kt8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CGBET_3Z0BcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
