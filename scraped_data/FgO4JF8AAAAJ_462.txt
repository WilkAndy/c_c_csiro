Design: Two dietary intervention trials each with identical crossover design. Subjects: 17 women and 21 men, mildly hyperlipidaemic, selected by advertisement. Main outcome measures: Fasting plasma lipids on a low fat diet (25% fat energy), margarines and butter diets (35% fat energy). Results: Plasma LDL cholesterol levels after the margarine diets and the low fat diet were similar, but all were 11-15% lower compared to butter (P< 0.001). Whereas the monounsaturated margarines did not differ from each other, the polyunsaturated margarines without trans resulted in a 6% reduction (0.25 mmol/L, 95% Cl+ 0.08 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:2lgwpy1Hu6IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=277695", "cites_per_year": {}}
