We hypothesised that these patients do not have the normal adaptive response to a high fat diet and fail to show an increase in HDL cholesterol while LDL cholesterol increases as expected Twenty one men with CAD were matched for age (53 years), BMI (26) and cholesterol (5.3 mmol/L) with 26 men with no personal or family history of CAD.  The men with CAD had a low HDL cholesterol (0.84 vs 0.97 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a high plasma triglyceride [TG] (1.95 vs 1.50 mmol/L, P < 0.05).  After a 2 week baseline low fat (25% of energy) period they were given a high carbohydrate (CHO) drink (2.6 MJ/day) for 3 weeks.  At the end of this period a monounsaturated fat drink (from canola oil) equal in energy and protein content to the high CHO drink was given for 3 weeks.  At the end of the high CHO period TG rose and HDL fell significantly compared with baseline while at the end of the high fat period, TG and LDL cholesterol fell (28% and 6% respectively) and HDL cholesterol rose significantly (16%) compared with the high CHO period (all P < 0.01).  The rise in HDL was greater (P < 0.01) in the normal group (19% vs 13%) while the fall in TG was greater (P < 0.05) in the CAD group (335 vs 24%) The change in LDL cholesterol was similar.  However once the change in HDL was corrected for baseline HDL cholesterol it was not significantly different between groups. Thus men with CAD have an impaired HDL response to dietary fat only by virtue of their low baseline HDL.  The CAD group have elevated insulin levels at 4-16 minutes after an i/v glucose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:_sH1KHQ1xKcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-26b1c56c-708c-3a8e-8aed-09c864165602", "cites_per_year": {}}
