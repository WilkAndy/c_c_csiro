DESIGN: Forty-nine free-living subjects took part in a prospective double-blind crossover dietary intervention study. The apoB EcoR1 cutting site was present in was five women and 18 men (E+) and absent in 15 women and 11 men (E-). INTERVENTION: Subjects consumed a low fat (25% energy), low cholesterol (less than 200 mg/day) diet. After two weeks on this background diet (baseline) subjects were randomly assigned to consume a liquid supplement for three weeks which was either fat and cholesterol free or which contained fat (30 to 36 g) and cholesterol (650 to 780 mg). After the first three-week period subjects switched to the other supplement. Blood samples were collected for plasma lipid analysis after an overnight fast on two consecutive days at the end of baseline and on three consecutive days after each three-week supplement period. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in response to diet between the RFLP groups. Changes in plasma total, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL 2 and HDL 3 cholesterol or plasma triglyceride were not different between the two RFLP groups. There was a significant difference between RFLP groups for baseline HDL 2-cholesterol (0.31\u00b10.04 and 0.16\u00b10.02 mmol/L for E-and E+ subjects, respectively) which was independent of sex and apoE genotype (P= 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the EcoRI RFLP of the apoB gene is not associated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Zk83zdSX4-UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.sahmri.org.au/en/publications/polymorphisme-de-la-longueur-du-fragment-de-restriction-du-gene-d", "cites_per_year": {}}
