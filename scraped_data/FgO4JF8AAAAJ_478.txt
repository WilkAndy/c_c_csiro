Total fat mass decreased by 20%. Men lost 2.1-3.3 and women 0.9-1.0 kg of lean mass (p= 0.004). Blood pressure decreased by 9.4/2.5 mm Hg, LDL cholesterol by 0.36 mmol/l and triglyceride by 0.24 mmol/l, with no differences between diets. Urinary calcium decreased by 0.7-0.8 mmol/day with no differences between diets. Deoxypyridinoline excretion increased with both diets but was significantly less with the dairy diet at both week 12 and week 16. Bone mineral density did not change. Conclusions: Increased dietary calcium had no impact on weight loss but may reduce bone loss."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:8Rip7PbZ7AYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/0802346", "cites_per_year": {}}
