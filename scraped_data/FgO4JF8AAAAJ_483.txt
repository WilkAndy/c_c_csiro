The major sterol in animals is cholesterol. Several sterols are present in plants, primarily beta-sitosterol (80 per cent), campesterol and stigmasterol (Figure 1). These phytosterols, or plant sterols, are essential components of the cell membranes of plants-a similar role to that played by cholesterol in animal cells. The structure of plant sterols is very similar to that of cholesterol, differing only in the side chain. Like cholesterol, plant sterols are minor components in the human diet. On average, Australians eat about 200-300mg of plant sterols per day. This is roughly equivalent to the intake of cholesterol. Strict vegetarians may consume twice the average intake. Major sources of plant sterols are vegetable oils and foods made from vegetable oils such as margarines and salad dressings. Nuts and seeds are also good sources. Cereals provide approximately 20 per cent of plant sterol intake.

There are many studies into the effects of plant sterols on blood cholesterol. To achieve this benefit plant sterols need to be consumed in moderate amounts on a daily basis. Enriching staple foods like margarines or spreads with plant sterols provides a simple means of realising the cholesterol lowering potential of plant sterols."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:qStMeLs7OP8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6688834634732720698&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OtKSTKmD01wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
