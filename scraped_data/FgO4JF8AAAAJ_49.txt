Objectives: Foods (90 g) containing whole-grain rye flour and whole-grain wheat flour were compared with low-fiber refined-cereal foods for their effects on markers of bowel health and the metabolic markers insulin and glucose. Design: Three 4-wk interventions were undertaken in a randomized crossover design with 28 overweight men aged 40\u201365 y who had no history of bowel disease. Against a background intake of 14 g dietary fiber (DF), the men were fed low-fiber cereal grain foods providing 5 g DF for a total of 19 g DF/d. High-fiber wheat foods provided 18 g DF, and high-fiber rye foods provided 18 g DF, both giving a total of 32 g DF/d. Fecal samples (48-h) and fasting and postprandial blood samples were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10492795835739835598", "cites_id": ["10492795835739835598"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/77/4/967/4689774", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zoz4KTjmnZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 9, "2005": 7, "2006": 13, "2007": 10, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 13, "2011": 11, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 8, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
