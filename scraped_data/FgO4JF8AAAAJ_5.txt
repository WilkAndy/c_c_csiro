CRP is positively associated with body mass index (BMI). In this study, we investigated the effects of dynamic weight loss on CRP in 83 healthy, obese women (mean BMI, 33.8\u00b10.4 kg/m2; range, 28.2 to 43.8 kg/m2). Subjects were placed on very-low-fat, energy-restricted diets (5700 kJ, 15% fat) for 12 weeks. Weight, waist and hip circumferences, plasma lipids, glucose, and CRP were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. CRP was positively associated with BMI (r=0.281, P=0.01) and waist circumference (r=0.278, P=0.01) but was not related to other atherosclerosis risk factors. BMI was significantly different between groups split above or below the median for CRP (34.8\u00b10.6 kg/m2 vs 33.0\u00b10.5 kg/m2, P=0.02). After 12 weeks, weight loss was 7.9\u00b10.3 kg.
