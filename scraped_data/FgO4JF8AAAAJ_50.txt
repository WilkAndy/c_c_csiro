Information technology (IT)-based (Web and mobile phone) interventions can be accessed by large numbers of people, yet there are few reported IT-based interventions targeting males\u2019 physical activity and dietary practices.Objective: This study examines the effectiveness of a 9-month IT-based intervention (ManUp) to improve the physical activity, dietary behaviors, and health literacy in middle-aged males compared to a print-based intervention.Methods: Participants, recruited offline (eg, newspaper ads), were randomized into either an IT-based or print-based intervention arm on a 2: 1 basis in favor of the fully automated IT-based arm. Participants were adult males aged 35-54 years living in 2 regional cities in Queensland, Australia, who could access the Internet, owned a mobile phone, and were able to increase their activity level. The intervention, ManUp, was based on social cognitive and self-regulation theories and specifically designed to target males. Educational materials were provided and self-monitoring of physical activity and nutrition behaviors was promoted. Intervention content was the same in both intervention arms; only the delivery mode differed. Content could be accessed throughout the 9-month study period. Participants\u2019 physical activity, dietary behaviors, and health literacy were measured using online surveys at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months.Results: A total of 301 participants completed baseline \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:4DUywrCQPfoC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8556166557738975757", "cites_id": ["8556166557738975757"], "pub_url": "https://www.jmir.org/2014/6/e136/;", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DcIb2SacvXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 18, "2016": 27, "2017": 22, "2018": 27, "2019": 29, "2020": 18, "2021": 22, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
