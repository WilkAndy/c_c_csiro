Our aim was to determine whether a low-fat, high-carbohydrate (CARB) diet impaired endothelial vasodilation compared with high saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA), or polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diets.Methods and Results\u2014 Forty healthy subjects were randomly crossed over to 4, 3-week isocaloric diets high in PUFA, MUFA, or SFA, containing at least 25 g of the relevant fat or a low-fat, CARB, high\u2013glycemic load diet. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), fasting blood lipids, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasma intercellular, and vascular adhesion molecules plasma E- and P-selectin were measured after each intervention. SFA impaired FMD compared with all other diets (5.41\u00b12.45% versus 10.80\u00b13.69%; P=0.01). FMD did not change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 183, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13157028548271264282", "cites_id": ["13157028548271264282"], "pub_url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.atv.0000163185.28245.a1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GtJhd8Enl7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 13, "2007": 9, "2008": 13, "2009": 12, "2010": 15, "2011": 15, "2012": 10, "2013": 14, "2014": 9, "2015": 17, "2016": 8, "2017": 15, "2018": 9, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
