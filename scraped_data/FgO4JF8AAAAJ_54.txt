Epidemiologic studies showed a relation between TFA intake and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), but studies examining adipose tissue TFAs have not uniformly confirmed this. We performed a case control study examining both adipose tissue levels and dietary intake of TFAs and first MI. Between 1995 and 1997, 209 cases of first MI completed a 300-item FFQ and 79 had an adipose tissue biopsy; 179 matched controls completed the FFQ and 167 had a biopsy. During the course of the study (mid-1996), TFAs were eliminated from margarines sold in Australia. Cases biopsied before mid-1996 had greater levels of trans 18:1(n-9) (32% P < 0.03) and trans 18:1 (n-11) (23%, P < 0.001) than controls biopsied before mid-1996. After June 1996, there were no differences between cases and controls in any of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Dnd9Dw9jpwAC", "num_citations": 178, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7403511801190032330,3751093753621194458", "cites_id": ["7403511801190032330", "3751093753621194458"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7403511801190032330&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yiNY-MGOvmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 13, "2006": 13, "2007": 17, "2008": 21, "2009": 17, "2010": 8, "2011": 3, "2012": 18, "2013": 11, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 4}}
