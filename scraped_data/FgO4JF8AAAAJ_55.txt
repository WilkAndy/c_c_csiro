Meal replacements in short-term weight loss and strategies for weight maintenance have not been investigated in PCOS. Objective: We compared in overweight women with PCOS the effects of meal replacements in short-term weight-loss and longer-term carbohydrate- or fat-restriction strategies on weight maintenance and improvements in reproductive and metabolic variables. Design: Overweight women with PCOS (n = 43; x\u0304 \u00b1 SD age: 32.1 \u00b1 5.2 y; weight: 96.1 \u00b1 18.4 kg) followed an 8-wk weight-loss regimen (2 meal replacements/d, 4904.4 \u00b1 127 kJ; phase 1) and then a 6-mo weight-maintenance carbohydrate- (<120 g/d) or fat- (<50 g/d) restriction regimen (phase 2). Results: Thirty-four women completed phase 1, and 23 women completed phase 2; the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6575629381334354624", "cites_id": ["6575629381334354624"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/84/1/77/4633138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wEoOSRVUQVsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 16, "2008": 4, "2009": 12, "2010": 9, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 14, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 11, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
