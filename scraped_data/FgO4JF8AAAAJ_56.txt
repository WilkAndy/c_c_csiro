RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014In this study, 26 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes consumed a HP (28% protein, 42% carbohydrate) or LP diet (16% protein, 55% carbohydrate) during 8 weeks of energy restriction (1,600 kcal/day) and 4 weeks of energy balance. Body weight and composition and REE were measured, and the TEF in response to a HP or LP meal was determined for 2 h, at weeks 0 and 12. RESULTS\u2014The mean weight loss was 4.6 \u00b1 0.4 kg (P < 0.001), of which 4.5 \u00b1 0.4 kg was fat (P < 0.001), with no effect of diet (P = 0.6). At both weeks 0 and 12, TEF was greater after the HP than after the LP meal (0.064 vs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:M9uBOdsrCRgC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15225163293034115885", "cites_id": ["15225163293034115885"], "pub_url": "https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-abstract/25/4/652/21031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LXOdQFmlStMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 11, "2005": 11, "2006": 17, "2007": 17, "2008": 12, "2009": 5, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 14, "2013": 13, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
