Objective: We compared the effects of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet with a conventional high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet on mood and cognitive function. Design: Ninety-three overweight or obese participants [x\u0304 \u00b1 SEM age: 50.2 \u00b1 0.8 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 33.6 \u00b1 0.4] were randomly assigned to an energy-restricted (\u22486\u20137 MJ, 30% deficit), planned isocaloric LCHF diet or an HCLF diet for 8 wk. Body weight and psychological well-being were measured by using the Profile of Mood States, Beck Depression Inventory, and Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory instruments at baseline and fortnightly. Cognitive functioning (working memory and speed of processing) was assessed at baseline and week 8.
