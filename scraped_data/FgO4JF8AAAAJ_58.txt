MJ/day) and 4 weeks energy balance (8.2? MJ/day) in two groups of subjects randomly assigned to either a high-protein (HP) diet (27% of energy (% E) as protein, 45% E as carbohydrate) or a lower-protein (LP) diet (16% E as protein, 57% E as carbohydrate).SUBJECTS: A total of 36 obese nondiabetic volunteers with hyperinsulinemia (10 males/26 females, aged 34\u201365? y, BMI 28\u201343? kg/m 2, fasting insulin 12\u201345? mU/l).MEASUREMENTS: Body weight and composition, TEE, REE, and RQ were measured at baseline and at week 16.
