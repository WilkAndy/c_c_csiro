The objective of this study was to determine whether regular consumption of foods enriched with n-3 long-chain PUFA can improve n-3 long-chain PUFA status (erythrocytes) and cardiovascular health. Overweight volunteers with high levels of triacylglycerols (TG; >1\u00b76 mmol/l) were enrolled in a 6-month dietary intervention trial conducted in Adelaide (n 47) and Perth (n 39), and randomised to consume control foods or n-3-enriched foods to achieve an EPA + DHA intake of 1 g/d. Test foods were substituted for equivalent foods in their regular diet. Erythrocyte fatty acids, plasma TG and other CVD risk factors were monitored at 0, 3 and 6 months. There were no significant differences between groups for blood pressure, arterial compliance, glucose, insulin, lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP) or urinary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12002791765810965374", "cites_id": ["12002791765810965374"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/impact-of-foods-enriched-with-n3-longchain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-on-erythrocyte-n3-levels-and-cardiovascular-risk-factors/1950B603FB865C718525B4DFB8D44D0A", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fmsleoR7kqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 10, "2009": 16, "2010": 10, "2011": 8, "2012": 13, "2013": 15, "2014": 13, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 6}}
