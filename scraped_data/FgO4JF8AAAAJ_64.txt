Protein-rich diets were recently associated with favorable effects on bone density, although this remains controversial. We hypothesized that a diet high in calcium and protein would minimize bone resorption during weight loss compared with a lower calcium, protein-rich diet. The effects of dietary calcium in high protein diets on calcium excretion and bone metabolism were examined in overweight adults (n = 50, BMI 33.4 \u00b1 2.1 kg/m2) during 12 wk of energy restriction followed by 4 wk of energy balance. Subjects were randomly assigned to isoenergetic diets (5.5 MJ/d, 34% energy from protein, 41% carbohydrate, 24% fat) high in either dairy protein (DP, 2400 mg Ca/d) or mixed protein sources (MP, 500 mg Ca/d). During energy restriction, weight loss was 10% (\u22129.7 \u00b1 3.8 kg, P < 0.01), and 24-h urinary calcium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8629509616479923857", "cites_id": ["8629509616479923857"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/134/3/568/4688635", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kW4abEYtwncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 7, "2007": 8, "2008": 16, "2009": 8, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
