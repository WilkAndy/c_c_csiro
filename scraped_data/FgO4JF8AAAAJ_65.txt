We sought to determine whether aerobic exercise training provided any additional improvements in endothelial function, oxidative stress or other established markers of cardiovascular risk when combined with an energy\u2010restricted diet in patients with type 2 diabetes.Methods:\u2002 In a parallel study design, 29 sedentary, overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes (age 52.4\u2003\u00b1\u20031.4\u2003years and BMI 34.2\u2003\u00b1\u20030.9 kg/m2) were randomized to a 12\u2010week moderate energy\u2010restricted diet (\u223c5000\u2003kJ/day and \u223c30% energy deficit) with or without aerobic exercise training [diet only (D), n\u2003=\u200316 and diet plus exercise (DE), n\u2003=\u200313].
