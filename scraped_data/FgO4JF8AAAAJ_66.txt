Second, to investigate the effect of combining whey and fructose on postprandial appetite hormones.Design:Randomized, double-blind crossover study of four beverages (1.1 MJ) containing 50 g of whey, fructose, glucose or 25 g whey+ 25 g fructose. Blood samples and appetite ratings were collected for 4 h then a buffet meal was offered.Subjects:Twenty-eight obese men (age: 57.0\u00b11.6 years, body mass index: 32.5\u00b10.6 kg/m 2)Measurements:Plasma ghrelin (total), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1 7\u201336), cholecystokinin-8, glucose, insulin and appetite ratings were assessed at baseline and 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 min after beverages, followed by measurement of ad libitum energy intake.Results:Fructose produced lower glycaemia and insulinaemia compared to the glucose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:hWqix75wD0QC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14735191232859824573", "cites_id": ["14735191232859824573"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/0803665", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vWEPHFvqfcwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 7, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 17, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 13, "2015": 10, "2016": 12, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
