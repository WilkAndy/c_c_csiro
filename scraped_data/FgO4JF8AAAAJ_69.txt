This study aimed to assess whether baseline and/or change in AMH levels with weight loss predict improvements in reproductive function in overweight and obese women with PCOS.Fifty-two overweight and obese women with PCOS and reproductive impairment (age 29.8 \u00b1 0.8 years, BMI 36.5 \u00b1 0.7 kg/m2) followed a 20-week weight loss programme. AMH, weight, menstrual cyclicity and ovulatory function were assessed at baseline and post-intervention.Participants who responded with improvements in reproductive function (n = 26) had lower baseline AMH levels (23.5 \u00b1 3.7 versus 32.5 \u00b1 2.9 pmol/l; P = 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:jMMVlDWEh88C", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12622742314953092793", "cites_id": ["12622742314953092793"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/24/8/1976/648405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uS4S3kH9LK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 7, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 22, "2014": 10, "2015": 15, "2016": 15, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
