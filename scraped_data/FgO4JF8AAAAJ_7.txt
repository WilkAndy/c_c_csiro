RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\u2014Replacing dietary protein for carbohydrate (CHO) during energy restriction and weight loss has been effective in sparing lean mass and improving insulin sensitivity in obese subjects but has not been tested in subjects with type 2 diabetes. We compared an HP diet (28% protein, 42% CHO, 28% fat [8% saturated fatty acids, 12% monounsaturated fatty acids, 5% polyunsaturated fatty acids]) with an LP diet (16% protein, 55% CHO, 26% fat [8% saturated fatty acids, 11% monounsaturated fatty acids, 5% polyunsaturated fatty acids]) in 54 obese men and women with type 2 diabetes during 8 weeks of energy restriction (1,600 kcal) and 4 weeks of energy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 486, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2748955062113383951", "cites_id": ["2748955062113383951"], "pub_url": "https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-abstract/25/3/425/21929", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D7bHfBBAJiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 11, "2004": 28, "2005": 25, "2006": 33, "2007": 27, "2008": 28, "2009": 27, "2010": 24, "2011": 30, "2012": 35, "2013": 28, "2014": 26, "2015": 19, "2016": 30, "2017": 14, "2018": 19, "2019": 18, "2020": 14, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
