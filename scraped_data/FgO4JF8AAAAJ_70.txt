We investigated the effect of a hypoenergetic high-protein high-cholesterol (HPHchol) diet compared to a similar amount of animal protein (high-protein low-cholesterol, HPLchol) on plasma lipids, glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A total of sixty-five participants with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (age 54\u00b74 (sd 8\u00b72) years; BMI 34\u00b71 (sd 4\u00b78) kg/m2; LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) 2\u00b767 (sd 0\u00b710) mmol/l) were randomised to either HPHchol or HPLchol. Both hypoenergetic dietary interventions (6\u20137 MJ; 1\u00b74\u20131\u00b77 Mcal) and total carbohydrate:protein:fat ratio of 40:30:30 % were similar but differed in cholesterol content (HPHchol, 590 mg cholesterol; HPLchol, 213 mg cholesterol). HPHchol participants consumed two eggs per d, whereas HPHchol participants replaced the eggs with 100 g \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=156377060599012065", "cites_id": ["156377060599012065"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/egg-consumption-as-part-of-an-energyrestricted-highprotein-diet-improves-blood-lipid-and-blood-glucose-profiles-in-individuals-with-type-2-diabetes/0D343EB44969CC003FC865D44308D7F4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4RoGrBuQKwIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 17, "2016": 13, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
