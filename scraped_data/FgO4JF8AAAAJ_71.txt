The mechanism for this is unclear. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of isocaloric test meals with differing protein to fat ratios on fasting and postprandial ghrelin, insulin, glucose, appetite, and energy expenditure before and after weight loss on the respective dietary patterns. Design: The study design was a randomized parallel design of 12 wk of weight loss (6 MJ/d) and 4 wk of weight maintenance (7.3 MJ/d) with meals administered at wk 0 and 16. Setting: The study was performed at an out-patient research clinic. Patients and Other Participants: Fifty-seven overweight (body mass index, 33.8 \u00b1 3.5 kg/m2) hyperinsulinemic men (n = 25) and women (n = 32) were studied. Interventions: High-protein \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16329094569290401852", "cites_id": ["16329094569290401852"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/90/9/5205/2838688", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PIhQ2v6YnOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 14, "2007": 11, "2008": 12, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 5, "2013": 10, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
