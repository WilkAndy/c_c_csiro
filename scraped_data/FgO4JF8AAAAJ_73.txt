Web-based programs offer good potential for delivery of weight loss programs. Yet, many Internet-delivered weight loss studies include support from medical or nutritional experts, and relatively little is known about purely web-based weight loss programs.Objective: To determine whether supportive features and personalization in a 12-week web-based lifestyle intervention with no in-person professional contact affect retention and weight loss.Methods: We assessed the effect of different features of a web-based weight loss intervention using a 12-week repeated-measures randomized parallel design. We developed 7 sites representing 3 functional groups. A national mass media promotion was used to attract overweight/obese Australian adults (based on body mass index [BMI] calculated from self-reported heights and weights). Eligible respondents (n= 8112) were randomly allocated to one of 3 functional groups: information-based (n= 183), supportive (n= 3994), or personalized-supportive (n= 3935). Both supportive sites included tools, such as a weight tracker, meal planner, and social networking platform. The personalized-supportive site included a meal planner that offered recommendations that were personalized using an algorithm based on a user\u2019s preferences for certain foods. Dietary and activity information were constant across sites, based on an existing and tested 12-week weight loss program (the Total Wellbeing Diet). Before and/or after the intervention, participants completed demographic (including self-reported weight), behavioral, and evaluation questionnaires \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1671715220407648127", "cites_id": ["1671715220407648127"], "pub_url": "https://www.jmir.org/2012/6/e173/UR", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f_8CxiIgMxcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 13, "2015": 14, "2016": 24, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
