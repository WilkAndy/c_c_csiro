As recently summarized by Ross, 1 studies in cell biology, animal models, clinical research, and epidemiology have been remarkably consistent in validating the early work of Virchow2 and others, suggesting that atherosclerotic lesions are essentially an inflammatory response. In clinical research and epidemiology, 2 inflammation blood markers in particular, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP), have been used. Many studies have confirmed that these markers predict future cardiovascular events independently of more traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as plasma lipid levels. 3\u20135 Because of this, several investigators have suggested that CRP might prove useful in clinical practice, 6, 7 whereas others \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:N5ITjzxXrcwC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4514057157711105208", "cites_id": ["4514057157711105208"], "pub_url": "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.atv.21.6.881", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uAwuhREnpT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 6, "2003": 15, "2004": 7, "2005": 8, "2006": 11, "2007": 9, "2008": 1, "2009": 14, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
