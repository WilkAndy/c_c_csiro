However, assessing the environmental performance of diets is complex due to the many types of foods eaten and the diversity of agricultural production systems and local environmental settings. To assess the state of science and identify knowledge gaps, an integrative review of the broad topic of environment and diet was undertaken, with particular focus on the completeness of coverage of environmental concerns and the metrics used. Compared with the 14 discrete environmental areas of concern identified in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the located journal literature mainly addressed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, to a lesser extent, land and water use. Some relevant concerns were rarely addressed or not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:hQ3-0SoZo6AC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16468831648071700173", "cites_id": ["16468831648071700173"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/advances/article-abstract/8/6/933/4772203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zU4G2SALjeQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 24, "2020": 30, "2021": 30, "2022": 22, "2023": 5}}
