Himalaya 292) is a novel hull-less barley variety lacking activity of a key enzyme of starch synthesis giving a grain containing less total starch, more amylose and higher total dietary fibre. Animal trials have shown that Himalaya 292 contains more resistant starch and has greater positive impact on biomarkers of large-bowel health than comparable wholegrain cereal products. The present study compared the effects of foods made from wholegrain Himalaya 292 with those made from wholegrain wheat on faecal biomarkers of bowel health in human subjects. Seventeen male and female volunteers aged 31\u201366 years consumed similar quantities of Himalaya 292, whole-wheat or refined cereal foods daily for 4 weeks in a randomised cross-over design. Total dietary fibre intakes from weighed food records were 45, 32 and 21 g/d for the Himalaya 292, whole-wheat and refined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10823354193133746119", "cites_id": ["10823354193133746119"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/wholegrain-foods-made-from-a-novel-highamylose-barley-variety-himalaya-292-improve-indices-of-bowel-health-in-human-subjects/A39766016FEE7366D2C024E1614C4C1B", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x7f4R0tHNJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 12, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
