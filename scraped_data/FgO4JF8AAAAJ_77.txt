Abnormalities in appetite regulation in PCOS patients may contribute to difficulties in weight management. Objective: We aimed to examine appetite, appetite hormones, and ad libitum food consumption before and after weight loss in overweight women with and without PCOS. Design: Overweight age- and weight-matched women with (n = 14) and without (n = 14) PCOS undertook an 8-wk energy-restricted diet (5185.3 \u00b1 141.6 kJ/d). At baseline and study end, subjects consumed a test meal (936 kJ; 25% of energy from protein, 9% from fat, and 67% from carbohydrate). Subjective appetite and circulating glucose, insulin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, and peptide YY were assessed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min.
