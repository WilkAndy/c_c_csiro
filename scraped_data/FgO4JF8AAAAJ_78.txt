To determine whether genetic variation in uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) is associated with obesity or obesity-related risk factors in overweight women.\u00b6Methods. We genotyped 526 overweight/obese women (mean body mass index 34.1 kg/m2, range 25.0 to 47.5 kg/m2) for the \u20133826 A\u2192G uncoupling protein-1 polymorphism. Of the 526 women genotyped 144 had fasting blood samples analysed for glucose and lipid measurements.\u00b6Results. The \u20133826 G allele was found with a frequency of 0.23 and was associated with higher BMI (p = 0.02). A higher frequency of this polymorphism (0.33) was found in subjects with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (p = 0.02), though adjustment for BMI weakened this significance (p = 0.06). The \u20133826 G variant was associated with increased fasting glucose (p = 0.01). This was, however, a result of a greater proportion of women \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4027650494551530282", "cites_id": ["4027650494551530282"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001250050036", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KpsrD8kW5TcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 8, "2004": 7, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
