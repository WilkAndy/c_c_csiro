Very low carbohydrate diets are used to promote weight loss, but their effects on physical function and exercise tolerance in overweight and obese individuals are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a very low carbohydrate, high fat (LC) diet with a conventional high carbohydrate, low fat (HC) diet on aerobic capacity, fuel utilization during submaximal exercise, perceived exercise effort (RPE) and muscle strength. Sixty subjects (age: 49.2 \u00b1 1.2 years; BMI: 33.6 \u00b1 0.5 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to an energy restricted (\u223c6\u20137 MJ, 30% deficit), planned isocaloric LC or HC for 8 weeks. At baseline and week 8, subjects performed incremental treadmill exercise to exhaustion and handgrip and isometric knee extensor strength were assessed. Weight loss was greater in LC compared with HC (8.4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10967295877518323225", "cites_id": ["10967295877518323225"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1038/oby.2009.134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ge4VTn6pM5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
