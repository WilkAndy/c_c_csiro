The total dietary period was 11 weeks and comprised normal foods plus specific fat supplements. In 27 mildly hypercholesterolemic men, total and LDL cholesterol were significantly lower during the 3-week oleic acid-rich diet, and were similar during the other three diets. For the four diets LDL cholesterol levels were in mg/dl: 1, 163; 2, 151; 3, 165; 4, 161. HDL cholesterol was significantly higher with the palmitic acid-rich diet, 42 mg/dl, compared with elaidic acid, 38 mg/dl, which in turn was not lower than with oleic acid, 38 mg/dl. Plasma elaidic acid concentration rose seven-fold with the trans fatty acid diet but did not increase the vulnerability of LDL to oxidative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 476, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4107717501984681863", "cites_id": ["4107717501984681863"], "pub_url": "https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(20)41418-X/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h69z702LATkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 18, "1994": 30, "1995": 42, "1996": 35, "1997": 36, "1998": 30, "1999": 29, "2000": 20, "2001": 18, "2002": 17, "2003": 17, "2004": 14, "2005": 20, "2006": 24, "2007": 12, "2008": 13, "2009": 10, "2010": 13, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
