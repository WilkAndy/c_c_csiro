Overweight women were randomised to lifestyle or standard treatment pre\u2010in vitro fertilisation with treatment cessation at embryo transfer. There was a greater reduction in weight (P\u2003<\u20030.001) for lifestyle treatment (\u22123.8\u2003\u00b1\u20033.0\u2003kg, P\u2003<\u20030.001) compared with no changes for standard treatment (\u22120.5\u2003\u00b1\u20031.2\u2003kg, P\u2003=\u20030.092). Both the intervention (\u22125.3\u2003\u00b1\u20034.6\u2003cm) and control (\u22123.5\u2003\u00b1\u20033.5\u2003cm) group had reductions in waist circumference (P\u2003<\u20030.001) with no differences between the two groups (P\u2003=\u20030.215). The overall pregnancy rate was 53% (20/38) for the intervention and control group combined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8666855131067014208", "cites_id": ["8666855131067014208"], "pub_url": "https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1479-828X.2011.01343.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QFwFn9LaRngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 12, "2018": 15, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
