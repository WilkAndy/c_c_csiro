Energy expenditure, respiratory quotient (RQ), appetite ratings using a visual analogue scale (VAS), insulin and glucose levels were measured before and after a test lunch at 1330 h. Food intake was recorded for the remainder of the day.Results:The TEF was 5% for both test lunches and meal type did not affect any variable measured by the VAS. There was an increase in post-prandial RQ above baseline (0.80) independent of treatment (0.88 and 0.90 for barley \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:t_XbbNNkFXoC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7007355371036167201", "cites_id": ["7007355371036167201"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/1602564", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IUyJWZUgP2EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 7, "2009": 13, "2010": 6, "2011": 14, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
