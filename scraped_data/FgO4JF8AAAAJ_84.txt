Although anti-mu\u0308llerian hormone (AMH), an inhibitor of follicle recruitment and maturation, is increased in women with PCOS, the usefulness of circulating AMH levels as a clinical predictor of menstrual response to weight loss in PCOS is not known. Methods: Overweight women with PCOS (n = 26, age 32.9 \u00b1 5.8 yr, weight 98.9 \u00b1 20.8 kg, body mass index 36.1 \u00b1 7.0 kg/m2, mean \u00b1 sd) followed an 8-wk weight loss and 6-month weight maintenance program. Results: Net reductions in weight (4.6 \u00b1 4.8 kg), waist circumference (6.0 \u00b1 5.3 cm), testosterone (0.3 \u00b1 0.6 nmol/liter), fasting insulin (3.7 \u00b1 7.6 mU/liter), and the homeostasis model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11434716562580897152", "cites_id": ["11434716562580897152"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/92/10/3796/2597949", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gP3oQyFGsJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 12, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 16, "2014": 10, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
