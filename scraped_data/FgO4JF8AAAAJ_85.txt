The aims of this study were to compare meal replacements (MR) with a conventional low-fat diet as weight loss strategies and to examine the effect of weight loss on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and other markers of endothelial function in overweight Australians with raised triglycerides (TG)(> 2 mmol/l).RESEARCH METHODS:Subjects matched for age, gender, fasting plasma TG and body mass index were randomized to two low-fat high-carbohydrate weight loss strategies (both< 6000 kJ), one using MR and the other a structured eating plan, control (C). Subjects followed both diets for 3 months. In total, 55 subjects completed the study. FMD, pulse wave velocity and blood pressure (BP) were measured at baseline and at 3 months, as were fasting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:L2DjCdFNi3gC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16570516062843189271", "cites_id": ["16570516062843189271"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/0803039", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FzislpBM9uUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 13, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
