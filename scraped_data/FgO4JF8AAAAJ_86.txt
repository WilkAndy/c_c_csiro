However, the link between dietary patterns, dietary cadmium intake and CKD has not been studied in China.Adults (n = 8429) in the China Health and Nutrition Survey who had at least one 3-day 24 h food record in combination with household food inventory in 1991, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2009 and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measured in 2009. Dietary pattern was identified using factor analysis. CKD was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.There were 641 (7.6%) cases of CKD in the sample. After adjustment for demographic, lifestyle factors (i.e. smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity) and chronic conditions, the odds ratio (OR) for CKD was 4.05 (95%CI 2.91\u20135.63, p for trend <0.001) for extreme quartiles of estimated cumulative cadmium intake.
