It is unknown whether overweight women with and without PCOS achieve similar benefits from weight loss for cardiovascular risk factors. Method: Overweight body mass index-matched women with (n = 15) and without (n = 17) PCOS (weight, 95.3 \u00b1 17.6 kg; body mass index, 35.6 \u00b1 5.3 kg/m2, mean \u00b1 sd) followed an 8-wk weight loss regime. Results: All subjects had similar reductions in weight (3.9 \u00b1 3.6 kg, 3.8%, vs. 4.5 \u00b1 4.1 kg, 4.7%, respectively, for PCOS and non-PCOS), waist circumference, fat mass, triglycerides, free testosterone, and fasting and postprandial insulin. At baseline, C-reactive protein (CRP) between groups was not significantly different (5.5 \u00b1 3.1 mg/liter for PCOS vs. 4.9 \u00b1 3.0 mg/liter for non-PCOS). There was a significant interaction between PCOS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17959152666852139982", "cites_id": ["17959152666852139982"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/92/8/2944/2597513", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ziO75jK6O_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 9, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
