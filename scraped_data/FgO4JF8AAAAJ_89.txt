Thirty-five subjects undertook a nonrandomized, single-blind study consisting of a 2 week baseline period, 6 weeks on high-phytosterol intake, 6 weeks on high-phytosterol intake plus increased fruit and vegetable intake, and a final 2 week washout period. Serum total cholesterol decreased by 8.3% from 6.59 to 6.04 mmol/l, and LDL cholesterol decreased by 12.6% from 4.44 to 3.88 mmol/l. Plasma phytosterol levels increased by 45% (sitosterol) and 105% (campesterol). Cholesterol-adjusted plasma \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotene levels decreased by 19\u201323%, lutein by 14%, and lycopene by 11%. Levels of \u03b1-carotene and lutein increased with extra fruit and vegetables \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17613231392868358528", "cites_id": ["17613231392868358528"], "pub_url": "https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(20)31311-0/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gFmtBqLEbvQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 8, "2006": 9, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
