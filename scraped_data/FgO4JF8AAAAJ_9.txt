There is also evidence that environmental exposures during early life can induce persistent alterations in the epigenome, which may lead to an increased risk of obesity later in life.Method:This paper provides a systematic review of studies investigating the association between obesity and either global, site-specific or genome-wide methylation of DNA. Studies on the impact of pre-and postnatal interventions on methylation and obesity are also reviewed. We discuss outstanding questions, and introduce EpiSCOPE, a multidisciplinary research program aimed at increasing the understanding of epigenetic changes in emergence of obesity.Results:An electronic search for relevant articles, published between September 2008 and September 2013 was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:voxG-9qLvA4C", "num_citations": 417, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2717071943215841060", "cites_id": ["2717071943215841060"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201434", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JH-PZIn6tCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 9, "2015": 33, "2016": 59, "2017": 75, "2018": 46, "2019": 61, "2020": 42, "2021": 37, "2022": 34, "2023": 7}}
