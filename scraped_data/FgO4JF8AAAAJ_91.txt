Overweight or obese women were randomly allocated to one of two study groups. The intervention group received an MRP Support app. The control group received a static app based on the information available with the MRP. A total of 58 adult women (Support n = 28; Control n = 30) participated in the 8-week trial. Their BMI was 26-43 kg/m2. Usage data suggested that the intervention group were more engaged with using the app throughout the study period. Mixed modelling revealed that the difference in weight loss between the intervention and control groups (estimated mean, EM = 3.2% and 2.2% respectively) was not significant (P = 0.08). Objective data suggested that users of the Support app were more engaged than those using the control app. A total of 1098 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9276111465869219380", "cites_id": ["9276111465869219380"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1357633X13479702", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NBYQNDteu4AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 16, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
