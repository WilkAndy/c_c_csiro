One-hundred-and-ten self-identified chocolate cravers were randomised to a waiting list control condition or to receive a 60-minute standardised group intervention on cognitive restructuring (CR) or cognitive defusion (CD). All participants were provided with a bag of chocolates which they were instructed to carry with them for seven days and try to resist eating; uneaten chocolates were returned at the end of the study period. Measures included chocolate consumption and other behavioural, cognitive and evaluative self-reported outcomes. Overall, the odds of abstinence from chocolate were 3.26 times higher for participants in the CD than the CR condition. The effect of the interventions depended on baseline cognitive distress levels; for individuals at high levels of cognitive distress the CD condition led to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8665297276364511361", "cites_id": ["8665297276364511361"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08870446.2012.694436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gdjdTvZRQXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 13, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
