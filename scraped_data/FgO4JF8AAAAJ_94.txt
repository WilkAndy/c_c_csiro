This paper utilised the 2011\u20132012 Australian Health Survey food intake data along with a highly disaggregated input\u2013output model to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) of Australians\u2019 dietary intake, and compare current patterns of eating which vary in diet quality and GHGe to the recommended diet. The average dietary GHGe were 18.72 \u00b1 12.06 and 13.73 \u00b1 8.72 kg CO2e/day for male and female adults, respectively. The correlation between total energy and GHGe was r = 0.54 (p < 0.001). Core foods contributed 68.4% and discretionary foods 29.4%. Within core foods, fresh meat and alternatives (33.9%) was the greatest contributor. The modelling of current dietary patterns showed the contribution of discretionary foods to GHGe was 121% greater in the average diet and 307% greater in the \u201clower quality, higher GHGe\u201d diet compared to the recommended diet. Reducing discretionary food intake would allow for small increases in emissions from core foods (in particular vegetables, dairy and grains), thereby providing a nutritional benefit at little environmental expense. Public health messages that promote healthy eating, eating to one\u2019s energy needs and improved diet quality will also contribute to lowering GHGe."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:KjbfwUOO_FMC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3927234895427042346", "cites_id": ["3927234895427042346"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/163542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Knxye1RXgDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 15, "2020": 14, "2021": 23, "2022": 13, "2023": 8}}
