Weight gain and obesity worsen the features of PCOS, while weight loss improves the features of PCOS. While there are potential barriers to successful weight management in young women who do not suffer from PCOS, women with PCOS may experience additional barriers. Weight management strategies in younger women with or without PCOS should encompass both the prevention of excess weight gain and achieving and maintaining a reduced weight through multidisciplinary lifestyle management, comprising dietary, exercise and behavioral therapy, as well as attention to psychosocial stress and practical and physiological barriers to weight management. Further research is warranted in the examination of specific barriers to weight management in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3190615999681228199", "cites_id": ["3190615999681228199"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/WHE.09.89", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p22t21hYRywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 10, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 12, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
