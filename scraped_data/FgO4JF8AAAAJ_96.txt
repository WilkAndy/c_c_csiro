Objective: We investigated the effect of carbohydrate distribution on postprandial glucose peaks with continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGMS), when consuming a moderate carbohydrate diet in energy balance in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Design: Twenty-three subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to each of four 3-d interventions in a crossover design with a 4-d washout period. Identical foods were provided for each treatment with a ratio of total carbohydrate to protein to fat of 40%:34%:26% but differing in carbohydrate content at each meal: even distribution (CARB-E; \u224870g carbohydrate), breakfast (CARB-B), lunch (CARB-L), and dinner(CARB-D), each providing \u2248125 g carbohydrate in the loaded meal in a 9-MJ diet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "FgO4JF8AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7640687035479210308", "cites_id": ["7640687035479210308"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/87/3/638/4633443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RLmrbWAsCWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 12, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 13, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
