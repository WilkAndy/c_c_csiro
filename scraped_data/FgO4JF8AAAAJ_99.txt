The aim of this study was to determine the relative bioavailability of natural folate from aleurone flour when ingested as a cereal. Using a series of randomized, short-term intervention trials with a cross-over involving eight men and eight women aged between 29 and 50 y, we compared the increment of plasma folate following ingestion of 1) 100 g wheat bran cereal (low folate control), 2) 100 g aleurone cereal, and 3) a tablet containing 500 \u03bcg folic acid taken together with 100 g wheat bran cereal (high folate control). Folate absorption was measured by estimating the area under the plasma folate concentration versus time curve.
