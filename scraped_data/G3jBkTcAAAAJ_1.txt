We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 3921, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8221391237542458747", "cites_id": ["8221391237542458747"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.89.5.1827", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ezU6kcU_GHIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 19, "1994": 18, "1995": 22, "1996": 33, "1997": 48, "1998": 56, "1999": 64, "2000": 75, "2001": 74, "2002": 93, "2003": 105, "2004": 128, "2005": 141, "2006": 179, "2007": 181, "2008": 179, "2009": 183, "2010": 202, "2011": 200, "2012": 181, "2013": 175, "2014": 161, "2015": 191, "2016": 202, "2017": 161, "2018": 168, "2019": 145, "2020": 135, "2021": 167, "2022": 154, "2023": 52}}
