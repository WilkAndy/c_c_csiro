The locus is unrelated to any known protein-coding gene. Microarray analysis of 454 tissue specimens (discovery) and 68 previously untested specimens (validation) showed elevated expression of CRNDE in >90% of colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas. These findings were confirmed and extended by exon microarray studies and RT-PCR assays. CRNDE transcription start sites were identified in CaCo2 and HCT116 cells by 5\u2032-RACE. The major transcript isoforms in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and colorectal tissue are CRNDE-a, -b, -d, -e, -f, -h, and -j. Except for CRNDE-d, the known CRNDE splice variants are upregulated in neoplastic colorectal tissue; expression levels for CRNDE-h alone demonstrate a sensitivity of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 258, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7589188798818398339", "cites_id": ["7589188798818398339"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1947601911431081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g7Dx1gA3UmkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 18, "2015": 25, "2016": 36, "2017": 31, "2018": 30, "2019": 30, "2020": 29, "2021": 32, "2022": 12, "2023": 7}}
