For example, methylation within gene promoters typically leads to tran Scriptional silencing. In turn, cytosine methylation is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes as well as in development. Increasingly, aberrant cytosine methylation patterns have been implicated in human disease and in particular cancer. Recently, the presence of sequence specific cytosine methylation in RNA has also been recog"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4449413278367641293", "cites_id": ["4449413278367641293"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130059734A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zW4CfM19vz0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
