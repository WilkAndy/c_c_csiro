CRNDE encodes at least ten splice variants of a long intergenic ncRNA (2) which (as lincIRX5) has been implicated in chromatin remodelling (3). Genes altered by siRNA knockdown of CRNDE (3) are involved in cancer, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1). More recently, transcripts from the CRNDE locus and its mouse orthologue (linc1399) have been implicated in pluripotency and differentiation (4, 5). While CRNDE expression is also elevated in some non-colorectal cancers, our microarray and RT-PCR analyses revealed elevated expression of CRNDE in 90% of colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas (1). Individual CRNDE transcripts (eg, CRNDE\u2013h) show promise as tissue and plasma biomarkers, potentially exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16298630272180834412", "cites_id": ["16298630272180834412"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP117678&sb=RECENT&n=17&rpp=50&page=61&tr=4005&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bFDE8uBdMOIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
