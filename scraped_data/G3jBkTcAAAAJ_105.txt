More particularly, the present invention is directed to a nucleic acid molecule, the expression profiles of which are indicative of the onset and/or progression of a colorectal neoplasm, Such as an adenoma or an adenocarcinoma. The expression profiles of the present invention are useful in a range of applications including, but not limited to, those relating to the diagnosis and/or monitoring of colorectal neoplasms, such as colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, in a related aspect the present invention is directed to a method of screen ing a subject for the onset, predisposition to the onset and/or progression of a large intestine neoplasm by Screening for modulation in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11223881109758631026", "cites_id": ["11223881109758631026"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110160072/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:clxhFGc8w5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
