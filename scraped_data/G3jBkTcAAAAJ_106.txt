The methylated domain of the genome comprises satellite and interspersed repeat sequences, intragenic sequences (excluding the first exon), and unannotated single-copy sequence; however, some promoters and CpG islands (biased toward shorter ones) were identified in the methylated DNA fraction of brain DNA [3]. Genome scanning approaches [4, 5] have identified that the promoters of a number of genes are methylated in a tissue-specific manner and that lack of methylation correlated with expression of associated genes.
