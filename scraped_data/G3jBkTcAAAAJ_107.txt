An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding the partial sequence of intron 3 of PSMA, a vector and a recombinant expression cassette are disclosed. The invention also provides a method of directing expression of a coding sequence in a prostate cell, a bladder cell, a breast cell and a vascular endothelial cell using the said constructs. This invention further provides a method of treatment of cancer using the said constructs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4597306714357521987", "cites_id": ["4597306714357521987"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US7074400B1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q17MYBnqzD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
