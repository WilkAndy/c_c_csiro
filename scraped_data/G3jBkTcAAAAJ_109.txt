Linkage was estimated using the LOD score method, on segregation data from seven pedigreed three\u2010generation families (245 individuals). The maximum likelihood estimate of the recombination fraction (\u03b8) was 0.215."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1420106167209157951", "cites_id": ["1420106167209157951"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2052.1994.tb00089.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P-XX9wg7tRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
