PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer and the vasculature of most solid tumors, and is currently the target of a number of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PSMA is also expressed in the brain, and is involved in conversion of the major neurotransmitter NAAG (N-acetyl-aspartyl glutamate) to NAA and free glutamate, the levels of which are disrupted in several neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and schizophrenia. To facilitate analysis of the role of PSMA in carcinoma we have determined the structural organization of the gene. The gene consists of 19 exons spanning approximately 60 kb of genomic DNA. A 1244 nt portion of the 5\u2032 region of the PSMA gene was able to drive the firefly luciferase reporter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 253, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4514176717347560291", "cites_id": ["4514176717347560291"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167478198002000", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YxvXqs6TpT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 9, "2000": 6, "2001": 17, "2002": 10, "2003": 13, "2004": 17, "2005": 15, "2006": 8, "2007": 10, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 14, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 16, "2023": 11}}
