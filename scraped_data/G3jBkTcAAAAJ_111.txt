In normal cells, it plays an essential role in core biologic processes by assuring the proper regulation of gene expression and stable gene silencing. In cancer cells, genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are altered and often represent an early and fundamental step in neoplastic transformation. The landmark study from Esteller and colleagues, published in Cancer Research in 2001, was the first to reveal high frequency promoter methylation across multiple cancer types. They highlighted that widespread alterations in DNA methylation may be a key characteristic of oncogenesis and proposed aberrant DNA methylation of gene promoters could provide markers for sensitive detection of nearly all cancer types. The authors used a candidate gene approach to show promoter hypermethylation occurred across 12 cancer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9857866448823448418", "cites_id": ["9857866448823448418"], "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/82/8/1461/694342", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YvNcVU4tzogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
