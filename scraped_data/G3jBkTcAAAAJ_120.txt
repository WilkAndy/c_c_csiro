The aim of this study was to assess whether changes in methylated glutathione s-transferase 1 (mGSTP1) levels are predictive of response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS).  Methods:  Plasma samples were collected prospectively from a phase I exploratory cohort of 75 men with  castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (40 treated with chemotherapy) and a phase II independent validation cohort (n=51). Plasma samples were collected at presentation with CRPC and pre- and post-cycle one of chemotherapy (90% Docetaxel). mGSTP1 levels were measured using a methylation-specific head-loop PCR assay from DNA isolated from either (1) immunomagnetic separation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or (2) free plasma DNA.
