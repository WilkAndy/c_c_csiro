Studies of development in many systems has led to a model showing that control of gene expression is exerted through three types of sequence region. The area immediately upstream or overlapping with the start site of transcription, the promoter, is important in defining the point(s) where transcription starts and, through the binding of specific transcription factors, may be involved in basal levels of transcription, responses to hormones or other regulatory factors, or in the tissue specificity of the gene\u2019s expression. Enhancers are sequence regions separate from the promoter that act to increase the level of transcription from a promoter. They may be located upstream or downstream of a gene or within an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6367078312614316756", "cites_id": ["6367078312614316756"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-372-0:321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1Ep4uP1nXFgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
