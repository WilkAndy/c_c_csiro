CRNDE transcripts are recognized as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which potentially interact with chromatin-modifying complexes to regulate gene expression via epigenetic changes. Complex alternative splicing results in numerous transcripts from this gene, and we have identified novel transcripts containing a highly-conserved sequence within intron 4 (\u201cgVC-In4\u201d). In colorectal cancer cells, we demonstrate that treatment with insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF) repressed CRNDE nuclear transcripts, including those encompassing gVC-In4. These repressive effects were negated by use of inhibitors against either the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway or Raf/MAPK pathway, suggesting CRNDE is a downstream target of both signaling cascades \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12850409168696039543", "cites_id": ["12850409168696039543"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488913003613", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d9iM9g3TVbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 18, "2015": 19, "2016": 41, "2017": 24, "2018": 23, "2019": 34, "2020": 20, "2021": 29, "2022": 19, "2023": 5}}
