More particularly, the present invention is directed to nucleic acid molecules in respect of which changes to DNA methylation levels are indicative of the onset and/or progression of a large intestine or breast neoplasm, such as an adenoma or adenocarcinoma. The DNA methylation status of the present invention is useful in a range of applications including, but not limited to, those relating to the diagnosis and/or monitoring of colorectal or breast neoplasms, such as colorectal or breast adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, in a related aspect the present invention is directed to a method of screening for the onset, predisposition to the onset and/or progression of a neoplasm by screening for modulation in DNA methylation of one or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200172963A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wEl2MEAJGjoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
