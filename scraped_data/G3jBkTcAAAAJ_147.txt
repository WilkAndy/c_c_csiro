Cleavage with these enzymes to release DNA fragments in a methylation-dependent manner can be combined with a novel method of amplification, Helper Dependent Chain Reaction (HDCR), to selectively amplify these fragments. HDCR uses \u201cHelper\u201d oligonucleotides as templates for extension of the free 3\u2032 end of target fragments to incorporate tag sequences at the ends of fragments. These tag sequences are then used for priming of amplification of target fragments. Modifications to the amplification primers (Drivers) and the Helpers ensure that there is selection for the sequences within target fragments with each cycle of amplification.
