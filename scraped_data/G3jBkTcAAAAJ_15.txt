Specific genes, including SEPT9, VIM1 and TMEFF2 become methylated in a high fraction of cancers and diagnostic assays for detection of cancer-derived methylated DNA sequences in blood and/or fecal samples are being developed. There is considerable potential for the development of new DNA methylation biomarkers or panels to improve the sensitivity and specificity of current cancer detection tests.Combined epigenomic methods \u2013 activation of gene expression in CRC cell lines following DNA demethylating treatment, and two novel methods of genome-wide methylation assessment \u2013 were used to identify candidate genes methylated in a high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4965410610500684475", "cites_id": ["4965410610500684475"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2407-14-54", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u0rZcqSu6EQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 12, "2016": 35, "2017": 20, "2018": 23, "2019": 20, "2020": 26, "2021": 32, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
