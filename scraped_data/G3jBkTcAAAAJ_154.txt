However, using standard methylation-specific PCR, DNA frist needs to be treated with bisulfite and sensitivity can be limited due to mispriming. Once formed, unwanted products amplify efficiently and can prevent detection of the target. To overcome this we have developed a system which does not require bisulfite treatment of DNA and in which selectivity is maintained throughout the amplification."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchnow.flinders.edu.au/en/publications/hdcr-a-novel-method-for-the-diagnostic-detection-of-methylated-dn", "cites_per_year": {}}
