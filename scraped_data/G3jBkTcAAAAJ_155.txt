We therefore initiated a study of the human N-ras promoter to determine the regions that control N-ras expression and their potential for interaction with DNA-binding proteins. N-ras CAT constructs were stably integrated into K562 cells by electric field-mediated gene transfer. A significant proportion of promoter activity was found to lie within a 438bp fragment comprising an untranslated exon (exon-1) with adjacent 5'sequence and a small CpG island. A 107 bp fragment at the 5'end of exon-1 was essential for promoter activity, while a 44bp deletion from within this region decreased promoter activity by two thirds. Unlike the human H-ras promoter, the human N-ras promoter did not exhibit bidirectional activity. DNase footprinting of the 438bp fragment revealed seven protected regions, many of which contain sequences homologous to known DNA binding protein sites (MLTF/myc, CREB/ATF, AP-1, AP-2, my b, and E4TF1). Using purified MLTF and appropriate competitors in gel shift and DNase footprinting assays, we demonstrated binding of MLTF to the MLTF consensus sequence within exon-1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=XEnUBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=info:pF3n6VcvQYwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=t3frhaIOdT&sig=vAeVIwv5symsn40Hm05HPd81Uek", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pF3n6VcvQYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
