DNA methylation changes may arise from aging or environmental exposures e.g. folate deficiency. We aimed to compare global and repeat-sequence DNA methylation in the colonic mucosa and blood of three groups of individuals \u2013 CRC patients, healthy people and patients with folate deficiency.We conducted a multisite cohort study collecting mucosa and blood from 176 patients who had undergone CRC resection and 194 healthy individuals at screening colonoscopy. Blood was also collected from 30 individuals with megaloblastic anaemia secondary to folate deficiency (red cell folate <539nM). Global DNA methylation was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry adapted from Quinlivan & Gregory (2008)1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/71/8_Supplement/91/574746", "cites_per_year": {}}
