The response of BRAF mutant colorectal cancer to recent targeted strategies such as anti-BRAF or combinations with MEK and EGFR inhibitors remains limited and highly heterogeneous within BRAF V600E cohorts. There is clearly an unmet need in understanding the biology of BRAF V600E colorectal cancers and potential subgroups within this population. Experimental Design: In the biggest yet reported cohort of 218 BRAF V600E with gene expression data, we performed unsupervised clustering using non-negative matrix factorization to identify gene expression\u2013based subgroups and characterized pathway activation. Results: We found strong support for a split into two distinct groups, called BM1 and BM2. These subtypes are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16723853410600078207", "cites_id": ["16723853410600078207"], "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-abstract/23/1/104/122927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f8uF9hEQF-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 16, "2018": 18, "2019": 22, "2020": 26, "2021": 42, "2022": 41, "2023": 13}}
