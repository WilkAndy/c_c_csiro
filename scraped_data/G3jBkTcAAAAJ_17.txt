Binding sequences for HeLa USF were selected from an initially random population of 20 bp sequences, defining the optimum USF binding sequence as R\u22125Y\u22124C\u22123A\u22122C\u22121G+1T+2G+3R+4Y+5. The significance of the flanking bases was further demonstrated by showing that USF and the related proteins c-Myc and Max discriminate between CACGTG-type E-boxes and that the primary means of discrimination appears to be the identity of the nucleotide at \u00b14, the presence of a T at \u22124 being inhibitory to binding by Myc but not by USF or Max. This suggests one mechanism by which bHLH factors are partitioned between multiple potential binding sequences in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1382323597538773718", "cites_id": ["1382323597538773718"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/22/14/2801/1008197", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1krw8_z_LhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 7, "1996": 9, "1997": 12, "1998": 19, "1999": 22, "2000": 14, "2001": 7, "2002": 7, "2003": 7, "2004": 9, "2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1}}
