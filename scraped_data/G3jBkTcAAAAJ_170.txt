They provide a key point of entry for identification of protein\u2013DNA interactions important for regulation of gene expression. The assay relies on the increased molecular size and decreased charge:mass ratio of a protein\u2013DNA complex compared to free DNA and the observation that many protein\u2013DNA complexes are stable through electrophoresis. Specific protein\u2013DNA complexes can therefore be readily distinguished from free DNA by their slower mobility during electrophoresis. The use of labeled DNA probes in gel mobility shift assays enables visualization of the specific complexes even in complex protein mixtures. It is important to use proper shielding to limit exposure to 32p radiation. There are also a number of nonradioactive methods available for visualization of complexes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780121647308502276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jLB370kaeCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
