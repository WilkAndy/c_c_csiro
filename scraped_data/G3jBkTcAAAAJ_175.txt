Metastatic disease is not generally amenable to surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. There is therefore great interest in developing gene therapy as a treatment for metastases and for some primary endocrine tumors. Current gene therapy strategies largely involve the use of gene-directed enzyme pro-drug therapy (GDEPT) and using recombinant adenovirus vectors. In this review the authors examine the basic strategies used in GDEPT, progress in this area, and future directions of this work."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Fulltext/2001/02000/Gene_therapy_for_endocrine_tumors__strategies_and.7.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cY4gKN-nmuYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
