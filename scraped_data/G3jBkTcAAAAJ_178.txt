The construct includes the following elements (1): a steroid responsive promoter from a tissue specific gene,(2) a coding sequence, and (3) an SV40 enhancer. The elements are arranged as follows: the steroid responsive promoter from the tissue specific gene being upstream of the coding sequence and the SV40 enhancer being 3'of the coding sequence, or the SV40 enhancer being upstream of the coding sequence and the steroid responsive promoter from the tissue specific gene being positioned between the SV40 enhancer and the coding sequence, or the steroid responsive promoter from the tissue specific gene being upstream of the coding sequence and the SV40 enhancer being positioned within an intron within the coding sequence. The promoter has a lowered level of steroid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/WO1998033903A1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i30EyhQV59wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
