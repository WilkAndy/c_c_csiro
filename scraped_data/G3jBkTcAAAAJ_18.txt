Chromosomal instability (CIN) is strongly negatively associated with MSI and has been shown to be a marker of poor prognosis in a small number of studies. However, a substantial group of \u201cdouble-negative\u201d(MSI\u2212/CIN\u2212) CRCs exists. The prognosis of these patients is unclear. Furthermore, MSI and CIN are each associated with specific molecular changes, such as mutations inKRASandBRAF, that have been associated with prognosis. It is not known which of MSI, CIN, and the specific gene mutations are primary predictors of survival.METHODS:We evaluated the prognostic value (disease-free survival, DFS) of CIN, MSI, mutations inKRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, FBXW7, andTP53, and chromosome 18q loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in 822 patients from the VICTOR trial of stage II/III CRC.
