In particular, mutations of N-RAS at codon 12, 13 or 61 are common in AML. Since overexpression of the normal N-RAS gene can also transform cells in vitro, we postulated the existence of mutations in the promoter region which had the potential to deregulate N-RAS expression, thus representing an alternative mechanism of N-RAS activation in leukemia. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism, combined with DNA sequencing and/or restriction mapping, was used to screen the N-RAS promoter in cells from 26 AML, 19 CML, 1 CLL and 13 non-leukemic samples. One AML patient had an A-to-G mutation at position 409 which abolished protein binding in the region of a c-MYB binding site. The mutation persisted during remission and relapse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-0391-6_26", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6KrHv7VFK3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
