Protein studies upon keratinized tissues have led to the identification of a large number of similar but non-identical proteins and hybridization studies upon DNA and mRNA have indicated that such proteins arise from large families of homologous genes (Kemp, 1975).The most interesting recent development in avian keratin gene studies involves the evolutionary relationship of the different genes and the way in which genome modification may contribute to the development of new genes and stabilization of existing ones. Findings of this nature are the major subject of this report."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17279949776463773099&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q722wsS2zu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
