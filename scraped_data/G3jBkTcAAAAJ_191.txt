In recent years mitochondria have assumed increasing importance in studies of development and differentiation, following the recognition that the organelles possess some degree of genetic and synthetic autonomy. The formation of such a complex organelle as the mitochondrion involves the synthesis and coordinate assembly of a myriad of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and small molecules, each with a specific spatial localization within the matrix and the two membrane systems of the organelle. The mitochondrion has very limited autonomy, only about 10% of its total protein is formed by the organelle. Its formation is under the control of both nuclear and cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) genetic systems which in addition to their direct effect on the mitochondrial localized systems also invoke the activities of non-mitochondrial enzyme systems and other organelles to contribute to the biosynthesis of the mitochondria. Biochemically the biogenesis of mitochondria is an immense problem; in essence, it is the study of the synthesis of an organelle whose detailed composition and molecular organization are at present largely unknown and a concerted attack employing a wide range of expertise and methodology is required. In this paper aspects of cytoplasmic genetic phenomenology and nuclear. cytoplasmic interactions as they bear on the problem of mitochondriogenesis are discussed. Firstly some of the characteristics of the mitochondrial cytoplasmic genetic system in yeast and the role of mitochondrial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3xbtCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA425&dq=info:ihRqVnfuhFkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=e5HdREVFJO&sig=on6Jq7uHZ0oxYpbY9Yl6o1Vu7R0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ihRqVnfuhFkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
