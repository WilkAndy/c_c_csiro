Because the CpG site at-58 could not be specifically methylated using commercially available enzymes, DNA fragments methylated at this site were obtained by the specific incorporation of 5-methylcytosine during oligonucleotide synthesis. Synthetic DNA fragments (100 bp) were made by the end-filling of overlapping oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1). Methylation at the-52 CpG site was achieved either through oligonucleotide synthesis or through the use of Hpall methylase.Binding of these DNAs to the MLTF has been studied using a gel retardation assay in which unbound DNA fragments are separated from DNA-MLTF complexes (Fig. 2). DNase I digestion experiments (Watt and MoUoy 1988) have confirmed that the UPE is protected from digestion in the DNA-MLTF complex. In Figure 2A, it is clear that MLTF binds to the unmethylated DNA (O) and binds with much reduced efficiency to DNA methylated on both strands at both-58 and-52 sites [0 (58, 52)]. The low level of binding to the methylated DNA, visible on long exposures of the gel in Figure 2A, had reached a maximum by 10 min, indicating that the difference reflects a lower amount of MLTF bound at equilibrium rather than a slower rate of association. Restriction enzyme fragments methylated at the Hpall site (-52) and synthetic DNA methylated at the-58 site were used to test relative effects of the methylation of each site on MLTF binding. From the results of Figure 2, B and C, it can be concluded that the inhibition of binding is due to methylation at the-58 site.
