Despite their promise, there is considerable potential for the development of new DNA methylation biomarkers or panels to improve the sensitivity and specificity of current CRC detection tests.To identify candidate genes methylated in a high fraction of CRCs we combined evidence from a number of techniques to form an initial set of diagnostic marker candidates. After further evaluation of the candidates by examination in a larger set of clinical tumour samples, we inspected two markers, BCAT1 and IKZF1, on clinical plasma specimens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1440150085074481325&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rfAcRN9w_BMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
