The cancer genome is frequently characterised by hypermethylation of specific genes concurrently with an overall decrease in the level of 5 methyl cytosine. This hypomethylation of the genome largely affects the intergenic and intronic regions of the DNA, particularly repeat sequences and transposable elements, and is believed to result in chromosomal instability and increased mutation events. This review examines our understanding of the patterns of cancer-associated hypomethylation, and how recent advances in understanding of chromatin biology may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying repeat sequence demethylation. It also considers how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 976, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16858620653363588112", "cites_id": ["16858620653363588112"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304419X06000564", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EOzM1ina9ekJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 25, "2008": 68, "2009": 78, "2010": 81, "2011": 75, "2012": 81, "2013": 76, "2014": 63, "2015": 61, "2016": 66, "2017": 59, "2018": 50, "2019": 59, "2020": 37, "2021": 45, "2022": 32, "2023": 14}}
