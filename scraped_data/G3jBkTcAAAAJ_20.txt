The resultant protein is capable of efficient DNA binding but is no longer able to activate transcription. A surprisingly high proportion of other transcription factors tested, AP1 (c-Fos\u229fc-Jun), Pit-1, Oct-1, CP1a and b, c-Myc, ATF\u229fCREB, AP2 and AP3 but not Sp1, were similarly cleaved by m-calpain to produce specific partial digestion products. These properties make m-calpain a particularly useful protease for proteolytic studies of transcription factors and also raise the possibility that m-calpain may be involved in vivo in regulation of turnover or transcriptional activity of a number of transcription factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13034522008508623589", "cites_id": ["13034522008508623589"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/21/22/5092/2376700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5eoq9rTs47QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 6, "1996": 11, "1997": 14, "1998": 10, "1999": 13, "2000": 14, "2001": 12, "2002": 10, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
