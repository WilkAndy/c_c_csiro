Relationships between phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway mutation, clinicopathologic characteristics, molecular features, and prognosis remain controversial. Experimental Design: A total of 1,093 stage I\u2013IV colorectal cancers were screened for PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20), KRAS (codons 12\u201313), BRAF (codon 600) mutations, and microsatellite instability (MSI). PTEN (exons 3\u20138) and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status were determined in 744 and 489 cases. PIK3CA data were integrated with 17 previous reports (n = 5,594). Results: PIK3CA and PTEN mutations were identified in 11.9% and 5.8% of colorectal cancers.
