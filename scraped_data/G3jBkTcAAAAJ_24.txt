By using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), it is possible to detect methylated sequences in a background of unmethylated DNA with a high level of sensitivity. MSP is frequently used to identify methylated alleles in carcinogenesis, and may be combined with the TaqMan real-time PCR system, which uses fluorescence-based detection of amplification products during the amplification phase of the PCR and increases the sensitivity of detection (MethyLight). Sequences that have been incompletely converted during the bisulfite treatment are frequently coamplified during MSP, resulting in an overestimation of DNA methylation. The presence of amplified sequences originating from partially unconverted material may be determined by sequencing or by restriction digests or Southern blots \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=131219055037383925", "cites_id": ["131219055037383925"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202302000622", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9QRECwkv0gEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
