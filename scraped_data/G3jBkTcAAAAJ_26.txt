With the aim of developing a new treatment we have used the human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, to evaluate the effectiveness of two enzyme-directed prodrug therapy (EPT) systems as a novel means for promoting tumor cell destruction in vivo. We have confined our study to the use of a PSA promoter, in a preliminary attempt to achieve prostate specificity. The two EPT systems used were the HSVTK/GCV and PNP/6MPDR systems. These were chosen for their differential dependence on DNA replication for their mechanism of action. In the present work, either the HSVTK or PNP gene, each controlled by a PSA promoter fragment, was delivered by an E1\u00af, replication-deficient human adenovirus (Ad5) into PC-3 tumors growing subcutaneously in BALB/c nude mice.
