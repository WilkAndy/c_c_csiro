Efficacy of immunoconjugates containing peptide 101, designed around the first 22 amino acids of bee venom, melittin, to maintain the amphipathic helix, to enhance water solubility, and to increase hemolytic activity, was assessed in nude mice bearing subcutaneous human prostate cancer xenografts. Methods: Mouse MAbs, J591 and BLCA-38, which recognise human prostate cancer cells, were cross-linked to peptide 101 using SPDP. Tumour-bearing mice were used to compare biodistributions of radiolabeled immunoconjugates and MAb, or received multiple sequential injections of immunoconjugates. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by delay in tumour growth and increased mouse survival. Results: Radiolabeled immunoconjugates and antibodies showed similar xenograft tropism \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1050844156502751208", "cites_id": ["1050844156502751208"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-003-0457-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6DekVjFZlQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 9, "2010": 3, "2011": 8, "2012": 9, "2013": 11, "2014": 3, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
