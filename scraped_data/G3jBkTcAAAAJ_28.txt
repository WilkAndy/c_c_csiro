Our previous results have shown that RMCs 1 and 2 can significantly stimulate specific transcription invitro from the adenovirus major late promoter. This stimulation is now shown to be due, at least in part, to the influence of HMGs 1 and 2 on binding of a specific transcription factor (MLTF) upstream of the start site of the gene to a region (\u221266 to \u221251) which is required for optimal transcription both invivo and invitro HMGs 1 and 2 cause both an increase in the rate of binding of the transcription factor to the DNA and alterations to the pattern of the DNaseI footprint of the factor on the DNA. Different binding states of the factor are also observed dependent on the presence of MgCl2, the factor being bound but not protecting the binding region \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7930686624407694640", "cites_id": ["7930686624407694640"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/16/4/1471/1076855", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MC3DYHd1D24J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 5, "1990": 4, "1991": 12, "1992": 9, "1993": 11, "1994": 12, "1995": 5, "1996": 5, "1997": 6, "1998": 7, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
