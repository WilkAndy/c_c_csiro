Understanding patterns of gene expression in nonneoplastic tissue, including regional anatomic expression changes within an organ, is vital to understanding gene expression changes in diseased tissue. To explore the gene expression change along the proximal-distal axis of the large intestine, we analyzed microarray data in 184 normal human specimens using univariate and multivariate techniques. We found 219 probe sets that were differentially expressed between the proximal and distal colorectal regions and 115 probe sets that were differentially expressed between the terminal segments, i.e., the cecum and rectum. We did not observe any probe sets that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9940340466659489726", "cites_id": ["9940340466659489726"], "pub_url": "https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00185.2006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vvet_fwu84kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 11, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 12, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
