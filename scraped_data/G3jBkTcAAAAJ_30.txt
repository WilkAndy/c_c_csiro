Whilst useful, these categories may not fully represent the underlying molecular subgroups. We screened 906 stage II/III CRCs from the VICTOR clinical trial for somatic mutations. Multivariate analyses (logistic regression, clustering, Bayesian networks) identified the primary molecular associations. Positive associations occurred between: CIN and TP53 mutation; MSI and BRAF mutation; and KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. Negative associations occurred between: MSI and CIN; MSI and NRAS mutation; and KRAS mutation, and each of NRAS, TP53 and BRAF mutations. Some complex relationships were elucidated: KRAS and TP53 mutations had both a direct negative association and a weaker, confounding, positive association via TP53 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7767484645894924630", "cites_id": ["7767484645894924630"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.4139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VinerCGmy2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 13, "2016": 20, "2017": 12, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
