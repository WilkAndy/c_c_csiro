All four genes have a very similar structure; each gene encodes a polypeptide of 97 amino acid residues and contains an intron in the 5\u2032 non-coding region, 37 base-pairs from the cap site. Comparison of the previously determined feather keratin gene C sequence to genes A, B and D indicates that a high level of gene correction has occurred in the protein coding and 5\u2032 non-coding regions, which show more than 90% homology, whereas the intron and 3\u2032 non-coding regions are by contrast poorly conserved with one or two exceptions. The dramatic conservation of the 5\u2032 non-coding region between the feather keratin sequences and an unrelated but co-expressed gene encoding a histidine-rich protein suggests that this segment may play an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15301946243599337310", "cites_id": ["15301946243599337310"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283689905937", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XofcDQlvW9QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 5, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 8, "2004": 8, "2005": 8, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
