In this study we used bisulfite genomic sequencing to map the boundaries of methylation that flank the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends of the CpG island spanning the promoter region of the glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) gene. We show that GSTP1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues including brain, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, pancreas, bone marrow, prostate, heart, and blood and that this expression is associated with the CpG island being unmethylated. In these normal tissues a marked boundary was found to separate the methylated and unmethylated regions of the gene at the 5\u2032-flank of the CpG island, and this boundary correlated with an (ATAAA)19\u201324 repeated sequence. In contrast, the 3\u2032-end of the CpG island was not marked by a sharp transition in methylation but by a gradual change in methylation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12761718379740087621", "cites_id": ["12761718379740087621"], "pub_url": "https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(19)62250-7/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RUX7e0C7GrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 10, "2002": 16, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 7, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
