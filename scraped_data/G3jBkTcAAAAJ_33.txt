One can use these plasmids to place any DNA region of interest (e.g., promoter, operator or enhancer) close to certain kinds of DNA structure that may influence its ability to work in a living cell. In the present example, we have placed a promoter from T7 virus next to the special DNA structures; the T7 promoter is then linked to a gene for a marker protein (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase). When plasmids bearing the T7 promoter are grown in cells of E. coli that contain T7 RNA polymerase, the special DNA structures seem to have little or no influence over the activity of the T7 promoter, contrary to our expectations. Yet when the same plasmids are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18261206990557683702", "cites_id": ["18261206990557683702"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/17/22/9447/1177207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9h8SggHXbP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 10, "1991": 12, "1992": 10, "1993": 6, "1994": 6, "1995": 5, "1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
