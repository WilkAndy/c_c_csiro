In addition, unlike prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA), PSMA is upregulated under conditions of androgen deprivation. Therefore, PSMA is an attractive therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer. Recently, both the promoter and the enhancer driving prostate\u2010specific expression of the PSMA gene were cloned. We describe here our analysis of the PSMA enhancer for the most active region(s) and present a way of using the enhancer in combination with the E. coli cytosine deaminase gene for suicide\u2010driven gene therapy that converts the nontoxic prodrug 5\u2010fluorocytosine (5\u2010FC) into the cytotoxic drug 5\u2010fluorouracil (5\u2010FU) in prostate cancer cells.Deletion constructs of the full\u2010length PSMA enhancer were subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector containing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9398354096486572849", "cites_id": ["9398354096486572849"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1097-0045(20001001)45:2%3C149::AID-PROS9%3E3.0.CO;2-O", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MWNrkkGpbYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 10, "2002": 9, "2003": 8, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 11, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 1}}
