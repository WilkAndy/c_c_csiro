This study assessed whether the level of circulating methylated GSTP1 (mGSTP1) in plasma DNA is associated with chemotherapy response and overall survival (OS).Methods:Plasma samples were collected prospectively from a Phase I exploratory cohort of 75 men with castrate-resistant PC (CRPC) and a Phase II independent validation cohort (n= 51). mGSTP1 levels in free DNA were measured using a sensitive methylation-specific PCR assay.Results:The Phase I cohort identified that detectable baseline mGSTP1 DNA was associated with poorer OS (HR, 4.2 95% CI 2.1\u20138.2; P< 0.0001). A decrease in mGSTP1 DNA levels after cycle 1 was associated with a PSA response (P= 0.008). In the Phase II cohort, baseline mGSTP1 DNA was a stronger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13736601163779639392", "cites_id": ["13736601163779639392"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2014463", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YIhNlPo1or4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 11, "2016": 17, "2017": 12, "2018": 13, "2019": 12, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
