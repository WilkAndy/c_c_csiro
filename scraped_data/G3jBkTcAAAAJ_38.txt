DNA methylation in 69 genomic regions at birth was associated with BMI z-scores at age 5 years, and in 63 regions with HOMA-IR. The methylation changes were generally small (< 5%), except for a region near the non-coding RNA nc886 (VTRNA2-1) where a clear link between methylation status at birth and BMI in childhood was observed (P= 0.001). Associations were also found between DNA methylation, maternal smoking and birth weight.Conclusions:We identified a number of DNA methylation regions at birth that were associated with obesity or insulin sensitivity measurements in childhood. These findings support the mounting evidence on the role of epigenetics in programming of metabolic health. Whether many of these small changes in DNA methylation are causally related to the health \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14145293384726554010", "cites_id": ["14145293384726554010"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2017228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:miVPcGMtTsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 10, "2019": 14, "2020": 6, "2021": 17, "2022": 21, "2023": 12}}
