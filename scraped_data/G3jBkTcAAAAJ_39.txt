Animal studies and human epidemiological studies have implicated epigenetic modifications as playing a key role in this process, but there are limited data from large well-controlled human intervention trials. This study utilized a large double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to test whether a defined nutritional exposure in utero, in this case docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), could alter the infant epigenome. Pregnant mothers consumed DHA-rich fish oil (800 mg DHA/day) or placebo supplements from 20 weeks\u2019 gestation to delivery. Blood spots were collected from the children at birth (n\u2009=\u2009991) and blood leukocytes at 5 years (n\u2009=\u2009667). Global DNA methylation was measured in all samples, and Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip arrays were used for genome-wide methylation profiling in a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9397079512405306761", "cites_id": ["9397079512405306761"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13148-016-0281-7/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ie0EVwciaYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 17, "2019": 17, "2020": 12, "2021": 16, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
