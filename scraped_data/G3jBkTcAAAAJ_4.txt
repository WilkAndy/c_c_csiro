We have examined whether methylation of CpG dinucleotides located within the binding site for a specific transcription factor, MLTF or USF, affects its binding to DNA. This HeLa cell factor binds to the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP), as well as endogenous cellular genes, and stimulates transcription in an in vitro assay. Synthetic oligonucleotides in which 5-methylcytosine replaces cytosine at specific sites were used to generate duplex DNAs, and the formation of complexes of these oligomers with MLTF was studied using a gel retardation assay. Methylation at a CpG site centrally located within the binding site strongly inhibited complex formation, whereas methylation at a site 6 bases away had no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 819, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=216791055627959927", "cites_id": ["216791055627959927"], "pub_url": "http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/2/9/1136.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d74vBVEyAgMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 17, "1990": 27, "1991": 24, "1992": 19, "1993": 26, "1994": 12, "1995": 16, "1996": 7, "1997": 11, "1998": 7, "1999": 14, "2000": 8, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 10, "2006": 12, "2007": 16, "2008": 27, "2009": 25, "2010": 36, "2011": 35, "2012": 51, "2013": 50, "2014": 46, "2015": 30, "2016": 31, "2017": 46, "2018": 51, "2019": 30, "2020": 39, "2021": 38, "2022": 26, "2023": 9}}
