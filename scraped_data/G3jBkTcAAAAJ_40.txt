Activity was measured both in the presence and in the absence of co\u2010transfected androgen receptor (AR).PSA and probasin regulatory regions showed strong responsiveness to co\u2010transfection of the AR in most cell types. The core PSA promoter region showed low activity and specificity, but the specificity and level of expression were substantially increased by inclusion of upstream sequences, particularly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9284633735519743410", "cites_id": ["9284633735519743410"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(19980401)35:1%3C18::AID-PROS3%3E3.0.CO;2-D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:si1DuzCl2YAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 10, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 10, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
