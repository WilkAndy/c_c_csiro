An assessment is made of the results in terms of the probable arrangement and linkage of mitochondrial genetic markers. The results are indicative of the retention of continuous stretches of the mitochondrial genome in most petite mutants, and it is therefore possible to propose a gene order based on co-retention of different markers. The order par, mik1, oli1 is suggested from the petite studies in the case of three markers not previously assigned an unambiguous order by analysis of mitochondrial gene recombination. The frequency of separation of markers by deletion in petites was of an order similar to that obtained by recombination in polar crosses, except in the case of the ery1 and cap1 loci, which were rarely \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10317985400466818548", "cites_id": ["10317985400466818548"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/jb.122.1.7-18.1975", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9MV9AA7ZMI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
