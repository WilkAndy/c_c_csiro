Moreover, PSMA expression is upregulated by androgen deprivation. These advantages make PSMA a useful target for prostate cancer therapy, especially in combination with conventional hormonal treatment. We recently reported that a prostate-specific enhancer is present in the third intron of the PSMA gene. In this study, we have further analyzed the activity of PSMA promoter/enhancer in prostate cancer cells and cells of other tissue origins (breast cancer MCF-7, lung cancer H157, and colorectal cancer HCT8 cells), and we have examined whether this construct could be used for efficient expression of the suicide gene, cytosine deaminase (CD), in vivo. The PSMA promoter/enhancer expressed the luciferase reporter gene in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14232928600503323372", "cites_id": ["14232928600503323372"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090429501012560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7Ip_IieFhcUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 9, "2003": 9, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
