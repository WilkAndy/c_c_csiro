However, the relative merits of the various systems for use under specific conditions are still being determined. We have compared the efficacy of cell killing by the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (HSVTK)/ganciclovir and the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/9-(beta-M-2-deoxy-erythropentofuranosyl)6-methylpurine enzyme/prodrug systems. These were chosen because of their differential dependence on DNA replication for their mechanism of action. The HSVTK and PNP genes, expressed from the identical prostate-specific antigen promoter, were transduced into human prostate and breast cancers cells using the same human adenovirus vector. The kinetics of cell killing in the presence of the respective prodrugs was monitored using a nondestructive assay that measured total cell \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18435199795614066206", "cites_id": ["18435199795614066206"], "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article-abstract/3/11/2075/8460", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HibuTIr81v8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 7, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
