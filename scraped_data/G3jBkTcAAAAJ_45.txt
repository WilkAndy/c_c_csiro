We have developed a new PCR technique for distinguishing related sequences in which additional selectivity is dependent on sequences within the amplicon. A 5\u2032 extension is included in one (or both) primer(s) that corresponds to sequences within one of the related amplicons. After copying and incorporation into the PCR product this sequence is then able to loop back, anneal to the internal sequences and prime to form a hairpin structure\u2014this structure is then refractory to further amplification. Thus, amplification of sequences containing a perfect match to the 5\u2032 extension is suppressed while amplification of sequences containing mismatches or lacking the sequence is unaffected. We have applied Headloop PCR to DNA that had been bisulphite-treated for the selective \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4212449855299081604", "cites_id": ["4212449855299081604"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/33/14/e127/1021377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hFU_K9OgdToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
