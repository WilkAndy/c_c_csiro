It can be used with crude protein mixtures or purified proteins in studies of, for example, the DNA sequence requirements of binding, kinetics of binding, identification and characterization of binding proteins, and cofactor requirements. Using radioactively labeled DNA probes, detection of proteins present in subfemtomolar amounts is readily possible. The principle of the assay is very simple\u2014DNA fragments and proteins are mixed in a suitable buffer and binding is allowed to occur. The mixture is then separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis; stable complexes of DNA and protein are generally significantly retarded in mobility in comparison with the free DNA and the separated complexes are normally viewed by phosphorimaging or autoradiography \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9706143945921654201", "cites_id": ["9706143945921654201"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-686-X:235", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ue13U34ms4YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 1}}
