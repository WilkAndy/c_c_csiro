A construct was made utilizing the adenovirus (human type II) VA1 gene promoter linked to 163 bp of SV40 DNA sequences cloned in antisense orientation relative to the promoter. The SV40 sequence corresponds to the 5\u2032 end of the large T\u2010antigen gene. In addition to the antisense constructs control plasmids were utilized which either lacked both promoter and SV40 elements, lacked RNA polymerase III promoter elements but contained SV40 sequences or contained the VA1 gene promoter fused to SV40 sequences in the sense orientation. The function of the various gene fusions was demonstrated in an in vitro transcription system and in vivo by S1 nuclease 5\u2032 end mapping following transfection into COS1 cells.
