Transgenic studies assigned a tumor-suppressive role to the inhibin \u03b1-subunit, and in human prostate cancer inhibin \u03b1-subunit gene expression was down-regulated. This study examined the inhibin \u03b1-subunit gene promoter and gene locus to determine whether promoter hypermethylation or LOH occurred in DNA from prostate cancer. The 5\u2032-untranslated region of the human inhibin \u03b1-subunit gene was sequenced and shown to be highly homologous to the bovine, rat, and mouse inhibin \u03b1-subunit promoter sequences. A 135-bp region of the human promoter sequence that continued a cluster of CpG sites was analyzed for hypermethylation. Significant (P < 0.001) hypermethylation of the inhibin \u03b1-subunit gene promoter occurred in DNA from Gleason pattern 3, 4, and 5 carcinomas compared with nonmalignant tissue samples.
