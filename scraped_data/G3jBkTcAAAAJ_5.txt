We present a novel method, DMRcate, that fits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model.We show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 684, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11817014290310326007", "cites_id": ["11817014290310326007"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1756-8935-8-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:92apR-N3_qMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 11, "2016": 26, "2017": 51, "2018": 53, "2019": 88, "2020": 103, "2021": 154, "2022": 136, "2023": 59}}
