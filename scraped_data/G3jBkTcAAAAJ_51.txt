We have used antibodies directed against a C\u2010terminal Oct\u20101 peptide to immunoselect binding sequences for HeLa cell Oct\u20101 from random\u2010sequence oligonucleotides and we describe the isolation of binding sequences of considerable heterogeneity. Although our consensus alignment indicated a 9\u2010bp TATGCAAAT motif with AT\u2010rich flanking sequences, this binding motif is not immediately obvious in the population of sequences and no clone actually contained this sequence. Screening these Oct\u20101\u2010binding sequences with a mouse whole\u2010brain extract demonstrated that the neuronal octamer\u2010binding proteins exhibit similar but distinct DNA sequence specificities.
