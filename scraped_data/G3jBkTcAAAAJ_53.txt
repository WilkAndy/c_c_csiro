It lacks introns, encodes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and is located adjacent to the gene QKI, which encodes an RNA binding protein. Deep bisulphite sequencing of ten colorectal cancer (CRC) and matched normal tissues demonstrated frequent hypermethylation within the CAHM gene in cancer. A quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) was used to characterize additional tissue samples. With a threshold of 5% methylation, the CAHM assay was positive in 2/26 normal colorectal tissues (8%), 17/21 adenomas (81%), and 56/79 CRC samples (71%). A reverse transcriptase-qPCR assay showed that CAHM RNA levels correlated negatively with CAHM % methylation, and therefore CAHM gene expression is typically decreased in CRC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6727714795728287235", "cites_id": ["6727714795728287235"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/epi.29046", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AzaGNfakXV0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 10, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
