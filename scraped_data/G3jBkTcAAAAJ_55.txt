The physical separations between markers were derived from studies involving a series of stable spontaneous petite strains which were isolated and characterized for the loss or retention of combinations of the five resistance markers. DNA-DNA hybridization using 32P-labelled grande mitochondrial DNA was employed to determine the fraction of grande mitochondrial DNA sequences retained by each of the defined petite strains.One petite clone retaining four of the markers in a segment comprising 36% of the grande genome was then chosen as a reference petite. The sequence homology between the mitochondrial DNA of this petite and that of the other petites was measured by DNA-DNA hybridization. For each petite, the total length of its genome derived by hybridization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17589278560449949699", "cites_id": ["17589278560449949699"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283676902837", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A3ADo6irGfQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
