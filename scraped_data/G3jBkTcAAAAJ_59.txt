Expressed PNP converts the systemically administered prodrug, 6MPDR, to a toxic purine, 6MP, causing cell death. We sought to increase the specificity of recombinant Ad vectors by controlling PNP expression with the promoter region from the androgen-dependent, prostate-specific rat probasin (Pb) gene. To increase its activity, the promoter was combined with the SV40 enhancer (SVPb). Cell lines were transfected with plasmids containing both a reporter gene, under SVPb control, and a reference gene cassette to allow normalization of expression levels. Plasmids expressed\u223c 20-fold more reporter in prostate cancer than in other cells, but surprisingly, the SVPb element was both androgen-independent and retained substantial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18436326818141027497", "cites_id": ["18436326818141027497"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/7700451", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qbxNro_92v8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 10, "2004": 11, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2}}
