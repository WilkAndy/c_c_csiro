Analysis of recombination between pairs of markers indicate the existence of at least three genetic classes; class A, cross resistant to venturicidin and including the mutations O III, [oli1-r], [OLG1-R], [tso-r]; class B, mutations O I, [oli17-r], [OLG2-R]; and class C, the mutation O II. The recombination data is consistent with mutations of each class residing in three separate genes, although mutations of class A and B show very close linkage.Recombination in non-polar crosses has demonstrated that markers of all three classes are linked to the mik1 locus in the configuration (AB)-mik1-C.
