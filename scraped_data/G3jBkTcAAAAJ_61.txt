PNP converts systemically administered prodrug, fludarabine phosphate, to a toxic metabolite, 2-fluoroadenine, that kills PNP-expressing and nearby cells by inhibiting DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Reporter gene expression directed by a hybrid prostate-directed promoter and enhancer, PSMEPb, was assayed after plasmid transfection or viral transduction of prostate and non-CaP cell lines. Androgen-sensitive (AS) LNCaP-LN3 and androgen-independent (AI) PC3 human CaP xenografts in nude mice were injected intratumorally with an ovine atadenovirus vector, OAdV623, that carries the PNP gene under PSMEPb, formulated with cationic lipid for enhanced infectivity.
