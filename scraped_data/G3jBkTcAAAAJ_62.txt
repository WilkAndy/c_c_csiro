Genetic information for 50S-rRNA is retained in mtDNA of petites carrying the loci for erythromycin or chloramphenicol resistance. In one strain retaining the erythromycin locus alone, 50S-rRNA hybridized to 14% of the mtDNA, representing a tenfold enrichment of these sequences compared with normal mtDNA. Where oligomycin or mikamycin loci are retained but chloramphenicol and erythromycin loci are deleted, little or no hybridization with 50S-rRNA is observed. Genes for 37S-rRNA are not retained in any of the petites investigated in this work. We conclude that the 50S-rRNA genes are located close to, or encompass, the chloramphenicol and erythromycin loci in mtDNA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12655893214346532551", "cites_id": ["12655893214346532551"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X74803815", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x9ZmHNPDoq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
