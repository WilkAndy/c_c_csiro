A number of procedures were available for the detection of Specific nucleic acid molecules. These proce dures typically depend on Sequence-dependent hybridisation between the target DNA and nucleic acid probes which may range in length from short oligonucleotides (20 bases or less) to Sequences of many kilobases. 0.003 For direct detection, the target DNA is most com monly Separated on the basis of Size by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Solid Support prior to hybridisation with a probe complementary to the target Sequence (Southern and Northern blotting). The probe may be a natural nucleic acid or analogue such as PNA or locked nucleic acid (LNA). The probe may be directly labelled (eg with'P) or an indirect detection procedure may be used. Indirect procedures usu ally rely on incorporation into the probe of a \u201ctag\u201d Such as biotin or digoxigenin and the probe is then detected by means \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17936485097476388552", "cites_id": ["17936485097476388552"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040086944A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yPYqIioy6_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 7, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
