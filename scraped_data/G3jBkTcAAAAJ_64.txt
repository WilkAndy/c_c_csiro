We have developed a more general expression system using the promoter from the PGK1 gene (encoding murine 3-phosphoglycerate kinase) which is widely expressed in almost all cell types, including early embryonic and ES (embryonic stem) cells. Firstly, we engineered the lac repressor to include a nuclear localisation signal and placed it under control of the PGK1 promoter. Efficient nuclear localisation of the represser was demonstrated by mobility-shift assays and immunofluorescence detection. For the target vectors, we modified the wild-type (wt) PGK1 promoter to include lac operator (lacO) sites for binding of the lac repressor and compared a number of different lacO positions and arrangements \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3126254439960893967", "cites_id": ["3126254439960893967"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111993904242", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D1pbe9mvYisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 9, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
