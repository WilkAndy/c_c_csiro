However, the relationship of normal tissue and tumor telomere lengths with CRC progression, molecular features and prognosis is unclear. Here, we measured relative telomere length (RTL) by real-time quantitative PCR in 90 adenomas (aRTL), 419 stage I-IV CRCs (cRTL) and adjacent normal mucosa (nRTL). Age-adjusted RTL was analyzed against germline variants in telomere biology genes, chromosome instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), TP53, KRAS, BRAF mutations and clinical outcomes. In 509 adenoma or CRC patients, nRTL decreased with advancing age. Female gender, proximal location and the TERT rs2736100 G allele were independently associated with longer age-adjusted nRTL. Adenomas and carcinomas exhibited telomere shortening in 79% and 67% and lengthening in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4550449160506200031", "cites_id": ["4550449160506200031"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:309y9GZxJj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
