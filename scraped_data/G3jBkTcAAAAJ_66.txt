This overview addresses the expression of the PSMA gene in terms of the promoter and enhancer and how that may play a role in gene therapy. We also review PSMA as a target for antibodies for imaging and treatment and the development of a novel hybrid T-cell receptor that combines the specificity of anti-PSMA antibodies with that of T-cell receptor activation when introduced into primary lymphocytes by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. We also discuss our recent findings on the expression of a PSMA-like gene and how that understanding allows specific targeting of PSMA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6141388414606225275", "cites_id": ["6141388414606225275"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/11062377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e69NgDmYOlUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
