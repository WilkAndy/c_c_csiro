When a multiply resistant haploid strain was crossed to an antibiotic sensitive strain, the resultant diploid progeny were completely resistant to chloramphenicol and oligomycin. However, the progeny showed different responses to mikamycin depending upon the concentration of antibiotic, all showed resistance to 25 \u03bcg/ml but only about half were resistant to high levels of mikamycin (>100 \u03bcg/ml). Detailed genetic analyses has shown that resistance to high levels of mikamycin is the result of a phenotypic interaction between two mutations, one nuclear and the other mitochondrial. The nuclear mutation by itself confers resistance to a number \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16497940220831407897", "cites_id": ["16497940220831407897"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00267293", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GR9JlDh19OQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
