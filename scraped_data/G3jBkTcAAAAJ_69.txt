Two competing models exist; one suggesting that the short RNA interacts with a nascent transcribed RNA strand (RNA\u2013RNA model) and the other implying that short RNA forms a heteroduplex with DNA from the unwound double helix, an R-loop structure (RNA\u2013DNA model). Likewise, the requirement for DNA methylation to enact TGS is still controversial. In vitro assays using purified recombinant murine Dnmt (DNA methyltransferase) 1-dN (where dN indicates an N-terminal truncation), 3a and 3b enzymes and annealed oligonucleotides were designed to question whether Dnmts methylate DNA in a RNA\u2013DNA heteroduplex context and whether a RNA\u2013DNA heteroduplex R-loop is a good substrate for Dnmts. Specifically, model synthetic oligonucleotides were used to examine methylation of single \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7413374198074704707", "cites_id": ["7413374198074704707"], "pub_url": "https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-abstract/432/2/323/86879", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QwNKL46Y4WYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
