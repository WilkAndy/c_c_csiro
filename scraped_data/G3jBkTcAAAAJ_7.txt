DNA methylation patterns are established early in development, modulated during tissue-specific differentiation and disrupted in many disease states, including cancer. To understand further the biological functions of these changes, accurate and reproducible methods are required to fully analyze the DNA methylation sequence. Here, we describe the 'gold-standard' bisulphite conversion protocol that can be used to re-sequence DNA from mammalian cells in order to determine and quantify the methylation state of a gene or genomic region at single-nucleotide resolution. The process of bisulphite treatment exploits the different sensitivities of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) to deamination by bisulphite under acidic conditions\u2014in which cytosine undergoes conversion to uracil, whereas 5-MeC remains unreactive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 401, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17225747137641321566", "cites_id": ["17225747137641321566"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2006.324", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XhTQecElDu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 18, "2009": 19, "2010": 31, "2011": 32, "2012": 33, "2013": 32, "2014": 33, "2015": 36, "2016": 24, "2017": 30, "2018": 20, "2019": 29, "2020": 12, "2021": 18, "2022": 21, "2023": 2}}
