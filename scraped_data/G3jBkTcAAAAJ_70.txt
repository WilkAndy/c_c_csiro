Here, we focused on a differentially methylated region (DMR) of approximately 1.9 kb that includes a 101-bp noncoding RNA gene (nc886/VTRNA2-1), which is maternally imprinted in \u223c75% of humans. This is unlike other imprinted genes, which demonstrate monoallelic methylation in 100% of individuals. The DMR includes a CTCF binding site on the centromeric side defining the DMR boundary and is flanked by a CTCF binding site on the telomeric side. The centromeric CTCF binding site contains an A/C polymorphism (rs2346018); the C allele is associated with less imprinting. The frequency of imprinting of the nc886 DMR in infants was linked to at least two nongenetic factors, maternal age at delivery and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6196694929705470622", "cites_id": ["6196694929705470622"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1815005115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ngqPAjUV_1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 10, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
