We therefore initiated a study of the human N-ras promoter to determine the regions that control N-ras expression and their potential for interaction with DNA-binding proteins. N-ras CAT constructs were stably integrated into K562 cells by electric field-mediated gene transfer. A significant proportion of promoter activity was found to lie within a 438bp fragment comprising an untranslated exon (exon -1) with adjacent 5\u2032 sequence and a small CpG island. A 107bp fragment at the 5\u2032 end of exon -1 was essential for promoter activity, while a 44bp deletion from within this region decreased promoter activity by two thirds. Unlike the human H-ras promoter, the human N-ras promoter did not exhibit bidirectional activity. DNase footprinting of the 438bp fragment revealed seven protected regions, many of which contain sequences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16760823346470727249", "cites_id": ["16760823346470727249"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-6018-6_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:US527QdomugJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
