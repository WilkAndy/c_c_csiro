Protein synthesis in isolated mitochondria of mutant [cap 2-r] is almost completely resistant to chloramphenicol inhibition while that in mitochondria of mutant [cap 1-r] is partially resistant. Biochemical differences between the two mutants were confirmed by studies of chloramphenicol inhibition of aerobic adaptation of anaerobically grown cells. The mutants appear to contain altered mitochondrial ribosomes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15784306185369795065", "cites_id": ["15784306185369795065"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006291X73909467", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-bn3xNgeDdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
