Since overexpression of normal N-ras is also transforming in vitro, the N-ras promoter of AML patients was analyzed for the presence of promoter mutations that may affect expression of the N-ras gene. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was used to analyze samples from 26 AML patients and 13 normal subjects. A novel polymorphism at position 390 within the N-ras promoter was observed in both AML patients and normal samples at an overall frequency of 26%. In addition, two of 26 patients had single-base substitutions within protein binding sites that altered the binding of transcription factors to the promoter. One patient had a T--> A mutation at position 520 within an AP-1 binding site; the other had an A--> G mutation at position 409 within a protein binding region adjacent to a Myb binding site. The data suggest that in addition to coding region mutations in the N-ras gene, mutations in the promoter region that could alter regulation of N-ras expression provide an alternative mechanism of involvement of N-ras in AML."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3409084091538282912", "cites_id": ["3409084091538282912"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/7656930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oBmTTet_Ty8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
