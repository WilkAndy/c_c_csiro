Although folate deficiency may contribute to DNA hypomethylation in colorectal cancer, findings on the association between total folate concentration and global DNA methylation have been inconsistent. This study determined global, LINE-1, and Alu DNA methylation in blood and colon of healthy and colorectal cancer patients and their relationship to folate distribution. Blood and normal mucosa from 112 colorectal cancer patients and 114 healthy people were analyzed for global DNA methylation and folate species distribution using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Repeat element methylation was determined using end-specific PCR. Colorectal mucosa had lower global and repeat element DNA methylation compared with peripheral blood (P < 0.0001). After adjusting for age, sex and smoking history, global but not repeat element \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16102788841730077166", "cites_id": ["16102788841730077166"], "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article-abstract/5/7/921/50006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7vFxpCKZeN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
