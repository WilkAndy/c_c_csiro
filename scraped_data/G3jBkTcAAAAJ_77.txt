We have developed a novel promoter by utilizing tandem repeats of a tissue-specific regulatory element from the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide (CT/CGRP) gene placed in close proximity to a basal promoter, thereby removing interstitial sequences. This promoter drives expression of reporter genes at much higher levels than the natural promoter while significantly improving specificity in thyroid C cells."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5577527001026711760", "cites_id": ["5577527001026711760"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720700002045", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0NBYpUFbZ00J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
