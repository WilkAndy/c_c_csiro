To investigate an alternative therapeutic approach, we examined the feasibility of targeting gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy delivered by adenoviral vectors to MTC. We previously described a modified human calcitonin (CT)/CT gene-related peptide promoter that produced increased expression while maintaining specificity for MTC cells. In this study, we introduced an additional level of specificity by using cell-specific splicing and examined whether the selectivity of the gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy for MTC was enhanced when both the promoter and splicing features were combined in a single transcription unit. Two replication-defective adenoviruses were constructed that expressed the Escherichia coli purine nucleoside \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4082782269833537794", "cites_id": ["4082782269833537794"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article-abstract/88/3/1310/2845442", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AumwyNf0qDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
