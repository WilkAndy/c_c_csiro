Elucidation of lipid accumulation mechanisms and metabolism are essential to understand obesity and associated diseases. Adipogenesis has been well studied in murine 3T3-L1 and human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) preadipocyte cell lines. However, most techniques for measuring LD accumulation are either not quantitative or can be destructive to samples. Here, we describe a novel, label-free LD quantification technique (LipiD-QuanT) to monitor lipid dynamics based on automated image analysis of phase contrast microscopy images acquired during in vitro human adipogenesis. We have applied LipiD-QuanT to measure LD accumulation during differentiation of SGBS cells. We demonstrate that LipiD-QuanT is a robust, nondestructive, time- and cost-effective method compared with other triglyceride accumulation assays \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8854492834657531083", "cites_id": ["8854492834657531083"], "pub_url": "https://www.jlr.org/article/S0022-2275(20)35489-4/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y_QA7FF64XoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 2}}
