The methylation-dependent restriction enzyme GlaI is used to selectively cut methylated DNA. Then targeted fragments are tagged using specially designed \u2018helper\u2019 oligonucleotides that are also used to maintain selection in subsequent amplification cycles in a process called \u2018helper-dependent chain reaction\u2019. The process uses disabled primers called \u2018drivers\u2019 that can only prime on each cycle if the helpers recognize specific sequences within the target amplicon. In this way, selection for the sequence of interest is maintained throughout the amplification, preventing amplification of unwanted sequences. Here we show how the method can be applied to methylated Septin 9, a promising biomarker for early diagnosis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9725986874865928931", "cites_id": ["9725986874865928931"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/41/1/e15/1168764", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:48p-Poil-YYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
