Greatest effects were seen on transcription from the SV40 late promoter, then the SV40 early promoter with similar levels of transcription enhancement being seen for the human metallothionein 2A, adenovirus major late and chicken feather keratin promoters. The results indicate that HMGs 1 and 2 act to increase initiation of transcription in vitro and differential effects on the promoters are consistent with their action being in part to enhance the binding or functional activity of promoter\u2010specific transcription factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1550116068346626336", "cites_id": ["1550116068346626336"], "pub_url": "https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0014-5793(89)80499-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IAFt7lkegxUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1}}
