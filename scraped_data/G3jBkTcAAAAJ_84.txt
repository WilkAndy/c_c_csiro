We have examined RS effects in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats fed either a high-amylose maize starch (HAMS) or a wholemeal made from high-amylose wheat (HAW) on ileal and colonic contractility ex vivo and expression of genes associated with smooth muscle contractility.Rats were fed diets containing 19 % fat, 20 % protein, and either low-amylose maize starch (LAMS), HAMS, wholemeal low-amylose wheat (LAW) or HAW for 11 week. Isolated ileal and proximal colonic sections were induced to contract electrically, or by receptor-independent (KCl) or receptor-dependent agents. Colonic gene expression was assessed using an Affymetrix microarray \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2715860945116559546", "cites_id": ["2715860945116559546"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10620-015-3537-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ungH7SOtsCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
