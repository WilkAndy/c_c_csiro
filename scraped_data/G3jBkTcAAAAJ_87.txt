Previous genome-wide linkage studies (GWLSs) have identified a new loci postulated to contain novel CRC risk genes amongst affected families carrying no identifiable mutations in any of the known susceptibility genes for familial CRC syndromes. To undertake a new GWLS, we recruited members from 54 non-syndromic families from Australia and Spain where at least two first-degree relatives were affected by CRC. We used single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to genotype 98 concordant affected relative pairs that were informative for linkage analyses. We tested for genome-wide significance (GWS) for linkage to CRC using a quantile statistic method, and we found that GWS was achieved at the 5% level. Independently, using the PSEUDO gene-dropping algorithm, we also found that GWS for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9128542407418164526", "cites_id": ["9128542407418164526"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2011149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LrU_V_QYr34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
