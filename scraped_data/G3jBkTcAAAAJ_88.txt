The method, called streptavidin bisulfite ligand methylation enrichment (SuBLiME), involves the specific labeling (using a biotin-labeled nucleotide ligand) of methylated cytosines in bisulfite-converted DNA. This step is then followed by affinity capture, using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads. SuBLiME is highly adaptable and can be combined with deep sequencing library generation and/or genomic complexity-reduction. In this pilot study, we enriched methylated DNA from Csp6I-cut complexity-reduced genomes of colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-116, HT-29 and SW-480) and normal blood leukocytes with the aim of discovering colorectal cancer biomarkers. Enriched libraries were sequenced with SOLiD-3 technology. In pairwise comparisons, we scored a total of 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9907993681375961075", "cites_id": ["9907993681375961075"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/epi.23330", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8586J8JDgIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
