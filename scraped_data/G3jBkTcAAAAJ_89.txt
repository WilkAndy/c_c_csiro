The use of differential denaturation in PCR is particularly suited to amplification of undermethylated sequences following treatment with bisulphite, since bisulphite selectively converts cytosines to uracil while methylated cytosines remain unreactive. Thus amplicons derived from unmethylated DNA retain less cytosines and their lower G + C content allows for their amplification at the lower melting temperatures, while limiting amplification of the corresponding methylated amplicons (Bisulphite Differential Denaturation PCR, BDD-PCR). Selective amplification of unmethylated DNA of four human genomic regions from three genes, GSTP1, BRCA1 and MAGE-A1, is demonstrated with selectivity observed at a ratio of down to one unmethylated molecule in 105 methylated molecules.
