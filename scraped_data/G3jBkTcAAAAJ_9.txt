Since it has been established that mammalian cells also have the capacity to methylate cytosines (C) at CpNpG sites we examined the effect of methylation of the outer C of the CpCpG on Sp1 binding. We find that methylation of the outer C is inhibitory and in particular methylation of both cytosines mCpmCpG inhibits binding by 95%. Furthermore, we have identified endogenous mCpmCpG methylation of an Sp1 site in the CpG island promoter of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene by genomic sequencing. This occurs in a proportion of retinoblastoma tumors which are extensively CpG methylated in the Rb promoter. The results raise the possibility that mCpmCpG methylation could have a biological function in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 274, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5514111031496105257", "cites_id": ["5514111031496105257"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111997001649", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KV1jpMQOhkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 14, "2000": 5, "2001": 14, "2002": 13, "2003": 13, "2004": 13, "2005": 17, "2006": 15, "2007": 10, "2008": 14, "2009": 13, "2010": 18, "2011": 11, "2012": 18, "2013": 13, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 7}}
