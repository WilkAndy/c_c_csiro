The clone was sequenced and demonstrated to be a pseudogene, with two deletions (one of 3 bases, the other 24 bases long), one single base insertion, and a nonsense mutation with respect to the functional human X-linked gene. It is flanked by terminal repeats in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions, but it has no 3\u2032 poly(A) remnant. The 3\u2032 untranslated region has a 34-bp sequence, with 29 bp homologous to the human 3\u2032 untranslated region. The overall percentage homology with the mouse and human X-linked PGK indicates that this pseudogene is probably more closely related to eutherian X-linked PGK genes than to the autosomal form. The results also suggest that pseudogenes are of considerable antiquity (>100 MYr) in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8248119865750270483", "cites_id": ["8248119865750270483"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0888754389900566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EzLjRlE1d3IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1}}
