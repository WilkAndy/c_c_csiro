The efficiency of specific gene transcription from methylated DNA was dependent on topology of the input DNA, the most significant effect being complete inhibition of transcription from one template which contained three methylation sites, one just 5\u2032 and two greater than 500 bases 3\u2032 to the site of transcription initiation. The inhibition of transcription depends on a factor(s) which is variably present in lysate preparations and is labile on storage at -70\u00b0."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16294558889256027374", "cites_id": ["16294558889256027374"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00417589", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7gTKPfrmIeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
