It does so via digestion of PCR amplicons produced from bisulfite-treated DNA, using a restriction enzyme that contains a cytosine within its recognition sequence, such as TaqI. Here, we introduce COBRA-seq, a genome wide reduced methylome method that requires minimal DNA input (0.1\u20131.0 \u03bcg) and can either use PCR or linear amplification to amplify the sequencing library. Variants of COBRA-seq can be used to explore CpG-depleted as well as CpG-rich regions in vertebrate DNA. The choice of enzyme influences enrichment for specific genomic features, such as CpG-rich promoters and CpG islands, or enrichment for less CpG dense regions such as enhancers. COBRA-seq coupled with linear amplification has the additional advantage of reduced PCR bias by producing full length fragments at high abundance. Unlike other reduced representative methylome methods, COBRA-seq has great flexibility in the choice of enzyme and can be multiplexed and tuned, to reduce sequencing costs and to interrogate different numbers of sites. Moreover, COBRA-seq is applicable to non-model organisms without the reference genome and compatible with the investigation of non-CpG methylation by using restriction enzymes containing CpA, CpT, and CpC in their recognition site."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14979413624411828035", "cites_id": ["14979413624411828035"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/115516", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q6-2ulOR4c8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
