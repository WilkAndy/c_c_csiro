A minor linkage peak from that study located on chromosome 1 correlates with the location of a known CRC risk-modifying gene, prostaglandin synthase (PTGS2). PTGS2 encodes the inducible prostaglandin synthase enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Prostaglandins are implicated in the initiation of carcinogenesis and progression of tumours. Sequencing of PTGS2 in a small subset of affected individuals identified a high frequency of the minor C allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs5275. We then genotyped the rs5275 polymorphism in 183 affected and 223 unaffected individuals from our CRC predisposed families. Tests for association in the presence of linkage were made using family-based association tests. The C allele was found to be significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6896276717746961166", "cites_id": ["6896276717746961166"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg201353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DrsaAiN_tF8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
