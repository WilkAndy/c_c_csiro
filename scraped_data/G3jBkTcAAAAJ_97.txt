In mammals, DNA is methylated at cytosine residues in the 5\u2032 position of CpG dinucleotides. The genomic methylation pattern is established in the early embryo before implantation and is then stably maintained throughout differentiation (2). However, in cancer the methylation pattern of the cell is altered, with repeated DNA regions often undergoing hypomethylation and CpG island promoter regions undergoing hypermethylation (3). Hypomethylation of DNA is thought to be involved in the expression of previously dormant proto-ongogenes, and hypermethylation of the promoter regions is associated with gene silencing. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and other CpG island genes, such as p15, p16 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3jBkTcAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10727172641814366525", "cites_id": ["10727172641814366525"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-372-0:219", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PUmix66S3pQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
