The susceptibility ofMaell to inhibition by cytosine methylationof interest for studies ofgene expression as its recognition sequence contains a CG dinucleotide which has the potential to be methylated in vertebrate DNA. In particular its recognition sequence is found within the binding sites for at least three mammalian ptr rpion factors-the adenovirus major late gene upstream element, CCACGTGA (2), the cAMP responsive element, TGACGTCA (3), and an adenovirus E2 factor finding site, T/ACGTCA (4).To determine the effect of cytosine methylation we have used synthetic DNAs methylated specifically within the MaeII recognition site by incorporation of 5-methyl deoxycytidine phosphoramidite during DNA synthesis (using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer, Model 380A).
