The AWRA Landscape model, AWRA-L, is a 0.05 (~ 5km) gridded soil and groundwater balance model which provides credible estimates of landscape water yield (runoff and baseflow), evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and aquifer recharge across Australia, for retrospective Water Resource Assessment, National Water Account and soil moisture monitoring purposes. This paper evaluates and compares the hydrologic performance of various versions of the AWRA-L model with a national water balance model (WaterDyn) and a global biogeochemical land surface scheme (CABLE), applied regionally. The versions of AWRA-L evaluated are:(a) v4. 5 nationally calibrated to streamflow,(b) v5. 0 including updated soil drainage properties, nationally calibrated to streamflow and satellite evapotranspiration (CMRSET) and soil moisture (AMSR-E); and (c) v5. 0 also calibrated according to eight separate regions to fit local conditions better. The models were compared against catchment streamflow, point estimates of flux tower derived evapotranspiration across Australia, and point estimates of 0-90cm profile soil moisture over the Murrumbidgee and Upper Hunter Catchments (see Figure 1). Satellite derived estimates of evapotranspiration (CMRSET, SLST) and soil moisture (AMSR-E, ASCAT) are also presented for comparison purposes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17518894507599488894", "cites_id": ["17518894507599488894"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17518894507599488894&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fmcCT7ydH_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
