Climate change may alter this flux by increasing the frequency of temperatures beyond the thermal optimum of GPP (Topt). We examined the relationship between GPP and air temperature (Ta) in 17 wooded ecosystems dominated by a single plant functional type (broadleaf evergreen trees) occurring over a broad climatic gradient encompassing five ecoregions across Australia ranging from tropical in the north to Mediterranean and temperate in the south. We applied a novel boundary\u2010line analysis to eddy covariance flux observations to (a) derive ecosystem GPP\u2013Ta relationships and Topt (including seasonal analyses for five tropical savannas); (b) quantitatively and qualitatively assess GPP\u2013Ta relationships within and among ecoregions; (c \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6037080122579827446", "cites_id": ["6037080122579827446"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15760", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9jrxumIEyFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
