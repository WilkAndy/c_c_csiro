Both fire behaviour and smoke dispersion models are now underpinning strategic and tactical fire management by many government agencies and therefore model accuracy at regional and local scales is increasingly important. This demands accuracy of all the components of the model systems, biomass fuel loads being among the more significant. Validation of spatial fuels maps at a regional scale is uncommon; in part due to the limited availability of independent observations of fuel loads, and in part due to a focus on the impact of model outputs.In this study we evaluate two approaches for estimating fuel loads at a regional scale and test their accuracy against an extensive set of field observations for the State of Victoria, Australia. The first approach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3304932410737429603", "cites_id": ["3304932410737429603"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718305917", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YwyubIR63S0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
