The objective of this study is to infer the relationships between patterns in OCO-2 observations and environmental drivers (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and therefore inform a process understanding of carbon fluxes using OCO-2. We use a multiple regression and inverse model, and the regression coefficients quantify the relationships between observations from OCO-2 and environmental driver datasets within individual years for 2015\u20132018 and within seven global biomes. We subsequently compare these inferences to the relationships estimated from 15 terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) that participated in the TRENDY model inter-comparison. Using OCO-2, we are able to quantify only a limited number of relationships between patterns in atmospheric CO2 observations and patterns in environmental driver datasets (i.e., 10 out of the 42 relationships examined). We further find that the ensemble of TBMs exhibits a large spread in the relationships with these key environmental driver datasets. The largest uncertainty in the models is in the relationship with precipitation, particularly in the tropics, with smaller uncertainties for temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Using observations from OCO-2, we find that precipitation is associated with increased CO2 uptake in all tropical biomes, a result that agrees with half of the TBMs. By contrast, the relationships that we infer from OCO-2 for temperature and PAR are similar to the ensemble \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14072081012892562901", "cites_id": ["14072081012892562901"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/21/6663/2021/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1fX6xx8TSsMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
