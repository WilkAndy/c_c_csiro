The experimental results are compared with a simple one-dimensional, two-source model for scalar transfer. We find that: (1) the observed scalar transfer resistance across the boundary layer at the underlying surface is simply related to flat-plate theory by a constant of 0.62, despite the complexity of the turbulent flow within the wind-tunnel canopy; (2) one-dimensional gradient-transfer theory, even with extensions to account for the non-local nature of turbulent transfer within the canopy, does not describe the observed details of scalar concentration gradients in the highly three \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15887293564121503132", "cites_id": ["15887293564121503132"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10546-010-9492-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nNXPc1IBe9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1}}
