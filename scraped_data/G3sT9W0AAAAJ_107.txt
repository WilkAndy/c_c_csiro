In this study, we use global observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite for years 2015\u20132019 and a geostatistical inverse model to evaluate 5 years of interannual variability (IAV) in CO 2 fluxes and its relationships with environmental drivers. OCO-2 launched in late 2014, and we specifically evaluate IAV during the time period when OCO-2 observations are available. We then compare inferences from OCO-2 with state-of-the-art process-based models (terrestrial biosphere model, TBMs). Results from OCO-2 suggest that the tropical grasslands biome (including grasslands, savanna, and agricultural lands within the tropics) makes contributions to global IAV during the 5 year study period that are comparable to tropical forests \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9908143217631160578", "cites_id": ["9908143217631160578"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abfac1/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AumZxsLLgIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
