However, evaluating regional changes in the terrestrial carbon balance is challenging due to the lack of surface flux measurements. This study reveals that the terrestrial carbon uptake over the Republic of Korea has been enhanced from 1999 to 2017 by analyzing long\u2010term atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements at the Anmyeondo Station (36.53\u00b0N, 126.32\u00b0E) located in the western coast. The influence of terrestrial carbon flux on atmospheric CO2 concentrations (\u0394CO2) is estimated from the difference of CO2 concentrations that were influenced by the land sector (through easterly winds) and the Yellow Sea sector (through westerly winds). We find a significant trend in \u0394CO2 of \u22124.75 ppm per decade (p < .05) during the vegetation growing season (May through \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13299214085786867265", "cites_id": ["13299214085786867265"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15061", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QZYyr79MkLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 5}}
