In arid and semi-arid regions water is the dominant driver of vegetation growth. However, few studies consider the fact that water can move laterally across the landscape as runoff via streams and floodplains, termed hydrologic connectivity. Using multiple observations alongside models and a hydromorphology dataset for Australia, we examine how ecosystems with high hydrologic connectivity differ in their vegetation response to water availability, soil properties, and interannual variability and extremes in vegetation productivity. We find that the average interannual variability of vegetation productivity is 21\u201334% higher in ecosystems with high hydrologic connectivity, with skewed annual anomalies showing larger extremes in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5981089746022457571", "cites_id": ["5981089746022457571"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722000517", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:42BmUW8ZAVMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
