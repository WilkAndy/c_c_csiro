Methyl radicals were generated by 193 nm photolysis of acetone, and at low pressures emission from nascent photofragments (CH3 and CO) is found to dominate. At higher pressures an additional emission band is seen in the C\u2013H stretching region, the time dependence of which shows a rapid rise and a slow decay, the latter being dependent on the laser intensity and accurately described by a second-order fit. The emission is assigned to vibrationally excited ethane formed by recombination of methyl radicals, with the decay identified as the recombination rate and the rapid rise as quenching of C2H6 to levels which have no excitation in the emitting mode (the \u03bd5 C\u2013H stretch). The recombination rate constants were determined from fits to the decays \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3576701784195481283", "cites_id": ["3576701784195481283"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2003/cp/b303780k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wz56klL_ojEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
