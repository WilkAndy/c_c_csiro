As such, it is of critical importance to accurately quantify spatio-temporal variation in both terms and determine their drivers. Both NPP and residence times are modulated by changing environmental conditions, including climate change and variability, atmospheric CO2, and Land Use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC). For the historical period, 1901-2017, outputs from a suite of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) from the TRENDY consortium, driven with observed changes in climate, CO2, and LULCC are analysed. Changes in global and regional carbon fluxes, stocks, and residence times are quantified, as well as an attribution to the underlying drivers. Using 16 models allows to quantify uncertainty and gives an indication to the level of confidence in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15766947985671901231", "cites_id": ["15766947985671901231"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140484435&h=tWBEzFLv8f0V93dUV0YyC72EVotuIYRkaW9zsOUgm08QK7T8xvAFIG0iQeoc9xBvJK8DVNpI4FMQdbPXMzDPkA%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L9AI9qdzz9oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
