The most comprehensive archive of publicly shared tree-ring data is the International Tree-ring Data Bank (ITRDB). Many records in the ITRDB have, however, been collected almost exclusively with a view on maximizing an environmental target signal (e.g. climate), which has resulted in a biased representation of forested sites and landscapes and thus limits its use as a data source for benchmarking. The aim of this study is to propose advances in land-surface modelling and data processing to enable the land-surface community to re-use the ITRDB data as a much-needed century-long benchmark. Given that tree-ring width is largely explained by phenology, tree size, and climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10596671939678458491", "cites_id": ["10596671939678458491"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10596671939678458491&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e1LiTfzwDpMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
