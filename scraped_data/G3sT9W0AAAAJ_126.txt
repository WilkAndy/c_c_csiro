Soil phosphorus impoverishment in parts of the Amazon basin limits biomass 38 growth, but the role of phosphorus availability in limiting its future carbon uptake has 39 not been considered in global model ensembles, eg, during the Coupled Model 40 Intercomparison Project for the 5th Assessment Report of the United Nations 41 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Here, we simulate a planned free-air CO2 42 enrichment experiment in the Amazon with an ensemble of 14 terrestrial ecosystem 43 models. We show that phosphorus feedbacks reduce the CO2-induced biomass carbon 44 sink to 79\u00b163 g C m-2 yr-1 over 15 years, a reduction of~ 50% compared to estimates from 45 carbon and carbon-nitrogen models. Our results suggest that the region\u2019s resilience to 46 climate change may be much smaller than previously assumed. Variation in the biomass 47 C response among the phosphorus-enabled models is considerable, ranging from 5 to 140 48 g C m-2 yr-1, due to contrasting assumptions relating to the flexibility in plant phosphorus 49 use and acquisition strategies. The model ensemble involuntarily represents diverse plant 50 functional strategies and generates a series of testable hypotheses. Experimental design 51 need to be targeted to reduce the uncertainties around the phosphorus feedback on the 52 CO2 fertilization effect. 53The intact \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6788682397282712865", "cites_id": ["6788682397282712865"], "pub_url": "https://nespclimate.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5.6_2_manuscript_naturegeosc_with-main-figs-and-appendix.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ib37Hqw-Nl4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2}}
