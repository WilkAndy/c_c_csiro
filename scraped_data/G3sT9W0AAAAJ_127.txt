A realistic representation of processes governing carbon allocation and phenology for the two 5 defining elements of savanna vegetation (namely trees and grasses) may be a key to understanding variations in tree/grass partitioning in time and space across the savanna biome worldwide. Here we present a new approach for modelling coupled phenology and carbon allocation, applied to competing tree and grass plant functional types. The approach accounts for a temporal shift between assimilation and growth, 10 mediated by a labile carbohydrate store. This is combined with a method to maximise long-term net primary production (NPP) by optimally partitioning plant growth between fine roots and (leaves+ stem). The computational efficiency of the analytic method used here allows it to be uniquely and readily applied at regional scale, as required, for example, within the framework of a global biogeochemical model. 15 We demonstrate the approach by encoding it in a new simple carbon/water cycle model that we call HAVANA (Hydrology and Vegetation-dynamics Algorithm for Northern Australia), coupled to the existing POP (Population Orders Physiology) model for tree demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. HAVANA-POP is calibrated using monthly remotely-sensed fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation 20 (fPAR) and eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7133671182993272617", "cites_id": ["7133671182993272617"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=99564fde0f2a81e93f116b4736eb5126a9122e98", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KS_BJiXk_2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
