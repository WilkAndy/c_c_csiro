In northern (north of 30\u00b0 N) ecosystems, warmer springs lead generally to an earlier onset of the growing season, and increased ecosystem productivity early in the season. In situ and regional\u2013 studies also provide evidence for lagged effects of spring warmth on plant productivity during the subsequent summer and autumn. However, our current understanding of these lagged effects, including their direction (beneficial or adverse) and geographic distribution, is still very limited. Here we analyse satellite, field-based and modelled data for the period 1982\u20132011 and show that there are widespread and contrasting lagged productivity responses to spring warmth across northern ecosystems. On the basis of the observational data, we find that roughly 15 per \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 223, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7848144871683445093", "cites_id": ["7848144871683445093"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0555-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZdF-9i026mwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 22, "2020": 51, "2021": 57, "2022": 65, "2023": 27}}
