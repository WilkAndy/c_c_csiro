Subsequently, we study the carbon cycle variations and relate their fluctuations to anomalies in vegetation productivity and climate drivers. Our five-year regional carbon flux inversion suggests that Australia was a carbon sink averaging-0.46\u00b10.08 PgC yr-1(excluding fossil fuel emissions), largely influenced by a strong carbon uptake (-1.04 PgC yr-1) recorded in 2016. Australia semi-arid ecosystems, such as sparsely vegetated regions (in central Australia) and savanna (in northern Australia), were the main contributors to the carbon uptake in 2016. These regions showed relatively high vegetation productivity, high rainfall and low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12921859036270958027", "cites_id": ["12921859036270958027"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=16807367&AN=155221012&h=Y1ar9Au4MifCc20qHW0FYV67VT1QjSGYHL5C0AgBUghMcBZVk8BxW%2BppWWkDps1fLCs%2BdceN%2F%2FBW2K49eR%2Bc%2BA%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yxWanlSqU7MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
