In this study we evaluated the performance of a newly developed multi-layer energy budget (Ryder et al., 2014) in a land surface model, ORCHIDEE-CAN (Naudts et al., 2014), which simulates canopy structure and can be coupled to an atmospheric model using an implicit procedure. Furthermore, a vertical discrete drag parametrization scheme was also incorporated into this model, in order to obtain a better description of the sub-canopy wind profile simulation. Site level datasets, including the top-of-the-canopy and sub-canopy observations made available from eight flux observation sites, were collected in order to conduct this evaluation. The geo-location of the collected observation sites crossed climate zones from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1026465723974138674", "cites_id": ["1026465723974138674"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.5594C/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MruXMyO9Pg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
