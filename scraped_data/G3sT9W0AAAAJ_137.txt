In light of this, we recently proposed a new approach encoded in a model called Populations-Order-Physiology (POP), for the simulation of woody ecosystem stand dynamics, demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. POP is suit-5 able for continental to global applications and designed for coupling to the terrestrial ecosystem component of any ESM. POP bridges the gap between first generation Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) with simple large-area parameterisations of woody biomass (typically used in current ESMs) and complex second generation DVMs, that explicitly simulate demographic processes and landscape heterogeneity of forests. The 10 key simplification in the POP approach, compared with second-generation DVMs, is to compute physiological processes such as assimilation at grid-scale (with CABLE or a similar land surface model), but to partition the grid-scale biomass increment among age classes defined at sub grid-scale, each subject to its own dynamics. POP was successfully demonstrated along a savanna transect in northern Australia, replicating the 15 effects of strong rainfall and fire disturbance gradients on observed stand productivity and structure.Here, we extend the application of POP to a range of forest types around the globe, employing paired observations of stem biomass and density from forest inventory data to calibrate model parameters governing stand demography and biomass evolution. 20 The calibrated POP model is then coupled to the CABLE land surface model and the combined model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7114739452545418982", "cites_id": ["7114739452545418982"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/11/2343/2014/bgd-11-2343-2014.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5kZtKtahvGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
