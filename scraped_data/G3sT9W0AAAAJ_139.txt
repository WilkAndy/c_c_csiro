Here we present diurnal and seasonal patterns in field and model-based components of respiration and investigate their responses to environmental conditions at a dry eucalypt forest, the Cumberland Plain SuperSite of the Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network. We conducted measurement campaigns of total CO2 flux from the soil surface (Rsoil), soil microbial respiration (Rmicrobe), root respiration (Rroot), litter respiration (Rlitter), and stem respiration (Rstem) in 2018. In total, six infrared gas analyzers with closed, dynamic auto-chambers and six forced diffusion auto-chambers were used for periodic campaigns. Further, Reco and its components were simulated using the Community Atmosphere-Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE), constrained by eddy covariance measurements and chamber measurements of Rsoil. A new version of CABLE was implemented with the Dual Arrhenius Michaelis Menten (DAMM) formulation to assess the importance of substrate availability for simulating Rmicrobe. We found that respiration rates showed similar diurnal patterns among the components, showing diurnal hysteresis between respiration components and temperature. In this dry ecosystem, the respiratory components were more responsive to seasonally increasing temperature in wet than in dry periods, and the responses were dependent on atmospheric relative humidity affecting the litter layer moisture content \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10500298.1", "cites_per_year": {}}
