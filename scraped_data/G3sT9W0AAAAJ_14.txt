Unlike the traditional methods of LSM evaluation or comparison, benchmarking uses a fundamentally different approach in that it sets expectations of performance in a range of metrics a priori\u2014before model simulations are performed. This can lead to very different conclusions about LSM performance. For this study, both simple physically based models and empirical relationships were used as the benchmarks. Simulations were performed with 13 LSMs using atmospheric forcing for 20 sites, and then model performance relative to these benchmarks was examined. Results show that even for commonly used statistical metrics, the LSMs\u2019 performance varies considerably when compared to the different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 218, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4733413008264587283", "cites_id": ["4733413008264587283"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/16/3/jhm-d-14-0158_1.xml?tab_body=abstract-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E-jSZA12sEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 31, "2017": 27, "2018": 29, "2019": 30, "2020": 30, "2021": 25, "2022": 31, "2023": 8}}
