Defining this relationship can improve understanding of how vegetation adjusts to the environment within and among ecoregions and assist to constrain earth system models. We synthesised data from 17 eddy covariance flux towers in the OzFlux network occurring over a broad climatic gradient encompassing five ecoregions across Australia ranging from tropical in the north to Mediterranean and temperate in the south. We applied a novel boundary line analysis to half-hourly eddy covariance flux observations to derive the GPP-Ta relationship and thermal optimum (Topt) across these ecosystems including seasonal analysis in tropical savannas. We showed that GPP-Ta relationships are convex parabolas with narrow curves in tropical forests \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFM.B14D..03B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
