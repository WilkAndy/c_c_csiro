However, the MLO station, which has the longest continuous northern hemisphere CO 2 record, and integrates CO 2 mostly from the temperate northern hemisphere, shows an increasing amplitude before the 1980s (P< 0.01), followed by no significant change thereafter. This intriguing deceleration in the CO 2 amplitude change after the 1980s has attracted less attention than the persistent increase at higher latitudes sites such as Point Barrow (BRW). We analyzed the potential driving factors (terrestrial and ocean carbon fluxes, land use emissions, fossil fuel emissions and atmospheric circulation) of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B13H2591W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
