Recent research efforts have investigated how this store can be further increased to offset human carbon emissions as a short-term climate change mitigation strategy. In what is seen as an added benefit to this, an increase in SOC can also improve soil fertility and food security. However, for these strategies to be successful, the response of SOC to climate variability and change needs to be quantified. This study combines a 12-year field monitoring program with modelled outputs to evaluate SOC stability in response to climate variability in Eastern Australia over a centennial scale. Sampling of a 585 km 2, grazing catchment was conducted in 2006, 2014 and 2018, during drought, post-drought and drought re-entry conditions respectively. Over this period, catchment SOC was found to be stable, with mean values of 3.33%(2006), 3.20%(2014 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.B32D..03G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
