Annual rainfall is low and is accompanied by marked inter-annual variability, leading to multi-year droughts. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency, magnitude and intensity of future droughts, with potentially major environmental and socio-economic consequences for Australia. However, Australian vegetation is well adapted to extended dry periods. Thus, the likelihood of drought-induced mortality in the future depends on the severity of future drought events and on vegetation resilience. Our goal was to assess the vegetation's drought resilience using the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model. We implemented a model of plant hydraulics and parameterised the behaviour of 6 broad vegetation types, representing 12 dominant overstorey species originating from a rainfall gradient (188-1125 mm yr-1) across New \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.H51M1653D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
