At the same time, soil phosphorus impoverishment in most of the Amazon basin is assumed to limit productivity and growth. Despite that, phosphorus feedbacks are not accounted for by global ecosystem model ensembles to date, eg during the Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. To address this, we simulated the planned free air carbon dioxide enrichment experiment in the Amazon (AmazonFACE) with an ecosystem model ensemble (+ 200ppm; n= 14). We show that phosphorus limitation on productivity reduces the carbon dioxide induced biomass carbon sink by 50-58% over 15 years compared to carbon-only and nitrogen-enabled models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B52C..01F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
