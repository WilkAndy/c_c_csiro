Recent years have seen a gradual shift in focus to better understanding not only primary productivity, but also rates of carbon turnover in terrestrial ecosystems. Large-scale productivity and biomass datasets have provided first estimates of how rates of biomass turnover vary globally, but information on the drivers of turnover, and the extent to which turnover times might now be out of equilibrium with productivity due to changing environmental conditions, remains scant. In order to balance their carbon budgets within known constraints at a variety of scales, global vegetation models make logical assumptions about how carbon is cycled through plants. Each model thus represents a set of self-consistent hypotheses of carbon flows.
