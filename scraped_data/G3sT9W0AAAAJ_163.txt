The situation is exemplified by the vast inland region of Australia, the driest inhabited continent. Using a global model, Poulter et al.(2014) inferred that Australian ecosystems contributed 57% of a record global carbon uptake anomaly in 2011, and have entered a regime of enhanced sensitivity to rainfall since the mid-1990s. Here we present new observation-based evidence confirming the significant role of Australian ecosystems in the 2011 carbon sink anomaly. Our results do not, however, support a shift in sensitivity of vegetation activity to rainfall. Carbon stocks in semi-arid systems are robust to native, year-to-year fluctuations of rainfall. Our evidence suggests that large episodes of carbon cycle variability, like the 2011 anomaly, are driven by pulse-response behaviour of the drought-adapted biota in response to inter-or multi-annual variations in rainfall amount.Our results are based on a model-data-fusion approach, in which the CABLE land surface model, applied to Australia at 0.05 degree spatial resolution, is constrained by multiple observation types. We will demonstrate the model performance against data from the OzFlux network of flux sties. Further we show that improved representations of coupled soil-canopy processes, developed in the Australian context, afford large improvements to CABLE predictions at globally distributed Fluxnet sites."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2093230943802652532&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dHc29nOmDB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
