Yet, none of the land surface models used in Earth system models, and therefore none of today's predictions of future climate, account for the interactions between climate and forest management. We addressed this gap in modelling capability by developing and parametrizing a version of the land surface model ORCHIDEE to simulate the biogeochemical and biophysical effects of forest management. The most significant changes between the new model called ORCHIDEE-CAN and the standard version of ORCHIDEE are the allometric-based allocation of carbon to leaf, root, wood, fruit and reserve pools; the transmittance, absorbance and reflectance of radiation within the canopy; and the vertical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.6292N/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
