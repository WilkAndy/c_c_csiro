It seems that the approach as proposed will only work under static disturbance regimes where the rate of return of catastrophic events is constant, and therefore the equilibrium landscape distribution can be estimated trivially."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15567745281730731351&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
