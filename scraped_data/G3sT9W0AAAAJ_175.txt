This paper explores the utility of multiple observation sets to constrain a terrestrial biosphere model of linked C, N, and P cycles (Wang et al., 2007), applied to the Australian continent. Observations include net ecosystem production (NEP) from 12 eddy-flux sites, litterfall data, and data on C, N and P stocks in soil and above-ground biomass. Soil C estimates were obtained from the VAST data set (Barrett, 2001) and a database of infrared spectroscopic measurements (Viscarra Rossel and Webster, 2012). Soil N and P values were sourced from the Australian Soil Resources Information System database. N and P in above-ground biomass were obtained from published literature. Results are used to:(i) quantify the impact of model N-and P-limitations on model performance against C-cycle observations (ii) quantify how well each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.B33H..01B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
