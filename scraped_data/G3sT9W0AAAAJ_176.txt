The methodology for primary production monitoring deserves greater attention from modellers as the credibility of models for projection of Earth system responses and feedbacks depends, at least in part, on their ability to reproduce contemporary observations. A methodology and preliminary product will be presented, developed for the Australian continent, in which eddy-covariance CO2 and latent heat flux measurements have been used in the development of a theoretically well-founded light-use efficiency model for GPP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.B11E..06P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
