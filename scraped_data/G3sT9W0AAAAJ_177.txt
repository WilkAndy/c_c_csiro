We use non-linear parameter estimation to optimise agreement between modelled and measured vertical profiles of temperature, water vapour, carbon dioxide, and deuterium content of water vapour. Modelled temperature and concentration profiles are derived from Lagrangian dispersion theory together with a Soil Vegetation Atmospheric Transfer (SVAT) model, which was enhanced by a new isotopically enabled hydrologic scheme for coupled transport of heat, water and stable isotopes (HDO and H218O) in soil and litter. We first present the new water isotope model, Soil-Litter-iso1, which is suitable for use as part of a SVAT scheme but also as part of an isotopically enabled land surface model. We show \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EGUGA..14.2082C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
