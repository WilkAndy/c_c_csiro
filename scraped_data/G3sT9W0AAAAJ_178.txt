The referee comments have been reproduced below and labelled \u201cComment xy\u201d, with corresponding author responses following each comment labelled \u201cResponse xy\u201d where x denotes the Referee number and y the Comment number.Anonymous Referee# 1 Harverd and co-authors used a fine-spatial-resolution model (BIOS2) to estimate the full C-CO2 model for Australia. The result is comprehensive in that it includes what could be expected to be the major contributors to the carbon budget. The results and discussion are well crafted and original in places ie figures 6 and 7 are refreshing. I recommend this paper for publication following technical comments and suggestions on the presentation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9742697464543778069&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
