We therefore optimise agreement between modelled and measured vertical profiles of temperature T, water vapour H2O, carbon dioxide CO2, and deuterium content of water vapour HDO. Modelled T and concentration profiles are derived from Lagrangian dispersion theory together with a Soil Vegetation Atmospheric Transfer (SVAT) model, which was enhanced by a new scheme for coupled transport of heat, water and stable isotopes in soil and litter, Soil-Litter-Iso. We first present the new water isotope model Soil-Litter-iso, which is suitable for SVAT modelling but also as part of a land surface scheme. The model permits using thick soil layers and large times steps, resulting in significantly improved computational efficiency compared with existing isotopically-enabled soil models of similar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.B12B..08C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
