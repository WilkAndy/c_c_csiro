Williams et al (2009) describe model data fusion as a multi-stage, iterative process involving model formulation, model characterisation, state/parameter estimation and assessment, generalisation, model validation and model reformulation, with each step involving comparison or combination of the model with data. Parameter estimation and data assimilation are two commonly studied components of model-data fusion.Here we explore the application of model-data fusion (mdf) to a simple water balance model called WaterDyn that was developed for the Australian Water Availability project (AWAP). The aim of AWAP is to monitor the state and trend of the terrestrial water balance of the Australian continent, at 5 km resolution in the past (1900 to present) and in near real-time (Raupach et al., 2009a, b). AWAP involves an operational system (King et al., 2009) providing weekly updates to calculated water stores and fluxes across Australia (http://www. csiro. au/awap). The purpose of using mdf in AWAP is to help provide best estimates of the water stores and fluxes, with some measure of their uncertainty (Trudinger et al., 2009)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=57ee6d8ddd611108836483b5eafbe141d1849c93", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:11rRrd_zkb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
