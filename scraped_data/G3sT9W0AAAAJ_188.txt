The instrument is based on a commercial 1 cm{sup -1} resolution FTIR spectrometer fitted with a mid-IR globar source, 26 m multipass white cell and thermoelectrically-cooled MCT detector operating between 2000 and 7500 cm{sup --}1. {delta}D in water vapour is measured in whole air passed at 1-2 L min{sup -1} through the cell in real time without any pre-treatment. For {delta}{sup 13}C measurements the sample airstream is dried to < 20 {mu}mol mol{sup -1} to avoid interference from water vapour. An inlet selection manifold allows automated sequential analysis of samples from up to 12 inlet lines, with typical measurement times of 4-5 minutes per line. The spectrometer, inlet sampling sequence, real-time spectrum analysis, data logging and real-time display are all under the control of a single program running on a laptop PC, and can be left unattended for continuous measurements over periods of days to weeks. Selected spectral regions of typically 100-200 cm{sup -1} width are analyzed by a least squares fitting technique to retrieve concentrations of trace gases and isotopologues. Typical precision is 1-2 %{sub o} for {delta}D and 0.1 - 0.2 %{sub o} for {delta}{sup 13}C. Calibration and performance are described in more detail in an associated poster. The collected spectra also provide simultaneous analysis of concentrations of CO{sub 2}, CH{sub 4}, CO and N{sub 2}O in the analyzed air samples with high precision, typically 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21074543", "cites_per_year": {}}
