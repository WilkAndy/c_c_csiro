For the current fourth phase of RAMI, six highly realistic virtual plant environments were constructed on the basis of intensive field data collected from (both deciduous and coniferous) forest stands as well as test sites in Europe and South Africa. Twelve RT modelling groups provided simulations of canopy scale (directional and hemispherically integrated) radiative quantities, as well as a series of binary hemispherical photographs acquired from different locations within the virtual canopies. The simulation results showed much greater variance than those recently analysed for the abstract canopy scenarios of RAMI-IV. Canopy complexity is among the most likely drivers behind operator induced errors that gave rise to the discrepancies. Conformity testing was introduced to separate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14334751185928874881", "cites_id": ["14334751185928874881"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425715301048", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gWvmPEFE78YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 10, "2017": 14, "2018": 32, "2019": 24, "2020": 29, "2021": 20, "2022": 27, "2023": 11}}
