Significant rotational dependences are found which are in excellent agreement with recent experimental results, where comparisons are possible. New extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photoabsorption spectra of the key b {sup 1}{pi}{sub u}<-X {sup 1}{sigma}{sub g}{sup +}(3,0) transition of N{sub 2} are also presented and analyzed, revealing a b({upsilon}=3) predissociation linewidth peaking near J=11. This behavior can be reproduced only if the triplet structure of the C state is included explicitly in the CSE-model calculations, with a spin-orbit constant A{approx_equal}15 cm{sup -1} for the diffuse C({upsilon}=9) level which accidentally predissociates b({upsilon}=3). The complex rotational behavior of the b-X(3,0) and other bands may be an important component in the modeling of EUV transmission through nitrogen-rich planetary atmospheres."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20723265", "cites_per_year": {}}
