Firstly, vertical profiles for the main isotopomer (16 O 16 O 16 O) were retrieved in the 1001.3-1004.3 cm-1 interval. Five vertically independent partial columns were obtained and validated against independent microwave radiometer measurements, balloon sonde data and Dobson spectrophotometer data. Profiles of the minor isotopomers (16 O 16 O 18 O, 16 O 18 O 16 O, 16 O 16 O 17 O, 16 O 17 O 16 O) were then retrieved in separate spectral intervals with three vertically independent partial columns being achieved. For these retrievals, the profile of 16 O 16 O 16 O was constrained to the previously retrieved profile, which was also used as the a-priori profile for the target species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.A52A0778H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
