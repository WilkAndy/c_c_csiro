Ecosystem respiration (Reco) arises from autotrophic and heterotrophic signals, constrained by distinct drivers. Here we investigate seasonal patterns in field observations and model-based components of Reco and quantify their responses to environmental conditions in a dry eucalypt forest near Sydney, Australia. We conducted measurement campaigns of total CO2 efflux from the soil surface (Rsoil), soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh), soil autotrophic respiration (root respiration, Rroot), and stem respiration (Rstem) in 2018-2019 using infrared gas analyzers with closed, dynamic auto-chambers, and forced diffusion auto-chambers. Reco and its components were simulated using the CABLE\u2013POP (Community Atmosphere-Biosphere Land Exchange\u2013Population Orders Physiology) land surface model, constrained by eddy covariance and chamber measurements of Rsoil and enabled with a new DAMM (Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten) module for decomposition of soil organic matter. We observed the largest mean contribution to Reco was from Rsoil (64.5\u00b10.08 (sd)%) across seasons. The measured contributions of Rh (49.1%), Rroot (15.4%), and Rstem (22.5%) to sum of the respiration components (Reco. sum) were very close to CABLE-POP model outputs of 45.9%, 11.0% and 21.9%, respectively. We observed a strong seasonal pattern in the contribution of Rsoil to Reco, which reached a minimum of about 33% in the early spring and increased to 70% during autumn. The modelled Rh was highly correlated with measured Rh (R2= 0.67, RMSE= 0.606).
