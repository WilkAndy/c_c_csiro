This variability is well understood for deciduous species but is poorly characterised in evergreen forests. Here we quantify the seasonal dynamics of a temperate evergreen eucalypt forest with measurements of LAI, litterfall, carbon and water fluxes, and meteorological conditions. We merged MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values with site-based LAI measurements to establish a 17-year sequence of monthly LAI. We ran the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE-POP (version r5046)) with constant and varying LAI for our site to quantify the influence of seasonal canopy dynamics on carbon and water fluxes. We observed that the peak of LAI occurred in late summer-early autumn, with a higher and earlier peak occurring in years when summer rainfall was greater. Seasonality in litterfall and foliar allocation (af) drove this pattern, suggesting a complete renewal of the canopy before the timing of peak LAI. Litterfall peaked in spring, followed by a high af in summer, at the end of which LAI peaked, and PC and Gs, opt reached their maximum values in autumn, resulting from a combination of high LAI and efficient, mature leaves. These canopy dynamics helped explain observations of maximum gross ecosystem production (FGEP) in spring and autumn and net ecosystem carbon loss in summer at our site. It would be valuable to apply a similar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3987846", "cites_per_year": {}}
