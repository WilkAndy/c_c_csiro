The instrument is based on a commercial 1 cm-1 resolution FTIR spectrometer fitted with a mid-IR globar source, 26 m multipass white cell and thermoelectrically-cooled MCT detector operating between 2000 and 7500 cm--1. \u03b4D in water vapour is measured in whole air passed at 1-2 L min-1 through the cell in real time without any pre-treatment. For \u03b4 13 C measurements the sample airstream is dried to< 20 \u03bcmol mol-1 to avoid interference from water vapour. An inlet selection manifold allows automated sequential analysis of samples from up to 12 inlet lines, with typical measurement times of 4-5 minutes per line. The spectrometer, inlet sampling sequence, real-time spectrum analysis, data logging and real-time display are all under the control of a single program running on a laptop PC, and can be left unattended for continuous measurements over periods of days to weeks. Selected spectral regions of typically 100-200 cm-1 width are analyzed by a least squares fitting technique to retrieve concentrations of trace gases and isotopologues. Typical precision is 1-2% o for \u03b4D and 0.1-0.2% o for \u03b4 13 C. Calibration and performance are described in more detail in an associated poster. The collected spectra also provide simultaneous analysis of concentrations of CO 2, CH 4, CO and N 2 O in the analyzed air samples with high precision, typically 0.1%. Performance of the FTIR analyzer will be illustrated with results from a recent field campaign in which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:39086753", "cites_per_year": {}}
