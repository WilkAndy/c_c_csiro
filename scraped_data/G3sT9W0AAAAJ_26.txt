However, direct measurement of global terrestrial ET is not feasible. Here, we first reviewed the basic theory and state-of-the-art approaches for estimating global terrestrial ET, including remote-sensing-based physical models, machine-learning algorithms and land surface models (LSMs). We then utilized 4 remote-sensing-based physical models, 2 machine-learning algorithms and 14 LSMs to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in global terrestrial ET. The results showed that the ensemble means of annual global terrestrial ET estimated by these three categories of approaches agreed well, with values ranging from 589.6\u202fmm\u202fyr (\u202fkm\u202fyr) to 617.1\u202fmm\u202fyr (\u202fkm\u202fyr). For the period from 1982 to 2011, both the ensembles of remote-sensing-based physical models and machine-learning algorithms suggested increasing trends in global terrestrial ET (0.62\u202fmm\u202fyr with a significance level of  and 0.38\u202fmm\u202fyr with a significance level of , respectively). In contrast, the ensemble mean of the LSMs showed no statistically significant change (0.23\u202fmm\u202fyr, ), although many of the individual LSMs reproduced an increasing trend. Nevertheless,<?pagebreak page1486?> all 20 models used in this study showed that anthropogenic Earth greening had a positive role in increasing terrestrial ET. The concurrent small interannual variability, i.e., relative stability, found in all estimates of global terrestrial ET, suggests that a potential planetary boundary exists in regulating global terrestrial ET, with the value of this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3506294002624362363", "cites_id": ["3506294002624362363"], "pub_url": "https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/24/1485/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e_eBeNHbqDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 6, "2021": 37, "2022": 50, "2023": 23}}
