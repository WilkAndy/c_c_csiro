Soil\u2013Litter\u2013Iso is a one-dimensional model for coupled transport of heat, water and stable isotopes (HDO and H218O) in soil and litter. It is sufficiently efficient for use at regional scale, yet includes the complexity of coupled heat and water transport enabling decomposition of the total moisture flux into liquid and vapour components. The numerical implementation is based on Ross\u2019 fast solution to the Richards equation (Ross, 2003). This, combined with the explicit solution of the energy and moisture equations at the soil/air interface, permit the isotopic calculations to be performed with thick soil layers and large times steps, resulting in significantly improved computational efficiency compared with existing isotopically-enabled soil models of similar complexity.
