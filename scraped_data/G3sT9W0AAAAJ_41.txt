We examine the global response of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) to the historic change in atmospheric CO2. The GPP of the terrestrial biosphere has increased steadily, keeping pace remarkably in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO2. Water-use efficiency, namely the ratio of CO2 uptake by photosynthesis to water loss by transpiration, has increased as a direct leaf-level effect of rising CO2. This has allowed an increase in global leaf area, which has conspired with stimulation of photosynthesis per unit leaf area to produce a maximal response of the terrestrial biosphere to rising atmospheric CO2 and contemporary climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8551491093367563557", "cites_id": ["8551491093367563557"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138519300998", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JSUXeNf_rHYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 18, "2022": 20, "2023": 12}}
