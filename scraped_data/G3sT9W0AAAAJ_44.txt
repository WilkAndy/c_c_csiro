Significant rotational dependences are found which are in excellent agreement with recent experimental results, where comparisons are possible. New extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photoabsorption spectra of the key b \u03a0 u 1\u2190 X \u03a3 g+ 1 (3, 0) transition of N 2 are also presented and analyzed, revealing a b (\u03c5= 3) predissociation linewidth peaking near J= 11. This behavior can be reproduced only if the triplet structure of the C state is included explicitly in the CSE-model calculations, with a spin-orbit constant A\u2248 15 cm\u2212 1 for the diffuse C (\u03c5= 9) level which accidentally predissociates b (\u03c5= 3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14449113361949087674", "cites_id": ["14449113361949087674"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/123/21/214304/921907", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uldTSgyQhcgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 11, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
