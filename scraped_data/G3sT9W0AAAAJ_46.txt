These data were used to test the alkene sub-mechanisms from the Master Chemical Mechanism version 3.1 (MCM v3.1). A comparison of measured and modelled propene-NOx data showed that the mechanisms required the inclusion of O(3P)+parent alkene reactions in order to adequately model the results over a wide range of VOC/NOx ratios. Sensitivity studies were performed on propene-NOx and 1-butene-NOx simulations to determine the effect of uncertainties in the chamber parameters and key photolysis rates on the O3, and NOx profiles. The low VOC/NOx propene simulations were sensitive to the formaldehyde (HCHO) photolysis channel that produces HO2 radicals and to the presence of O(3P) reactions. For the higher VOC/NOx propene simulations, the O3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4958052640487712914", "cites_id": ["4958052640487712914"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231005007995", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kij1jZuKzkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 7, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
