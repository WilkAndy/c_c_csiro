However, no systematic analysis has been performed on which regions or processes contribute to this term. To obtain deeper insight on the sources of uncertainty in global and regional carbon budgets, we analyzed differences in Net Biome Productivity (NBP) for all possible combinations of bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down data sets in GCB2018: (i) 16 dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and (ii) 5 atmospheric inversions that match the atmospheric CO  growth rate. We find that the global mismatch between the two ensembles matches well the GCB2018 budget imbalance, with Brazil, Southeast Asia, and Oceania as the largest contributors \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10576454675030786751", "cites_id": ["10576454675030786751"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GB006393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v8I6kH0dx5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 20, "2022": 26, "2023": 8}}
