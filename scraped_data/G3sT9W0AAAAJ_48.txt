The comparison was based on a correlation analysis between soil moisture products and in situ data collated from three separate ground-based networks: OzFlux, OzNet and CosmOz. The correlation analysis was performed using both original data sets and temporal anomalies, and was supported by examination of the time series plots. The interrelationships between the products were also explored using cluster analyses. The products considered in this study include: Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS; both Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (LMEB) algorithms), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2; both LPRM and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithms) and Advanced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5255408755578711462", "cites_id": ["5255408755578711462"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425716303583", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pi2_OWv27kgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 15, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
