It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981\u20132010. For 2001\u20132010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66\u20130.96) Pg year\u22121 located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03\u20131.96) Pg year\u22121 located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 375, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9301614542369188590", "cites_id": ["9301614542369188590"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1810512116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7uqF6yT5FYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 20, "2020": 77, "2021": 99, "2022": 123, "2023": 52}}
