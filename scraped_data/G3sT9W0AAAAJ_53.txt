It showed that the performance of turbulent energy flux predictions from different land surface models, at a broad range of flux tower sites using common evaluation metrics, was on average worse than relatively simple empirical models. For sensible heat fluxes, all land surface models were outperformed by a linear regression against downward shortwave radiation. For latent heat flux, all land surface models were outperformed by a regression against downward shortwave radiation, surface air temperature, and relative humidity. These results are explored here in greater detail and possible causes are investigated. It is examined whether particular metrics or sites unduly influence the collated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6289767522782450253", "cites_id": ["6289767522782450253"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/17/6/jhm-d-15-0171_1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TZI8wzy-SVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
