We examine the variations in coupling strength by perturbing the background climate (dry versus wet year) and the model physics (planetary boundary layer or cumulus scheme). For all choices of model physics, results identify Australia as a \u201chot spot\u201d of soil moisture\u2010atmosphere coupling for both mean and maximum temperatures. For the wet case, results are consistent for maximum temperature for all physics choices. Results diverge more for maximum temperature in the chosen dry year. The coupling of soil moisture with minimum temperature is weaker but consistent for all choices of model physics or whether a wet or dry year is used.
