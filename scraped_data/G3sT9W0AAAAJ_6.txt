The project determines the past history and present state of soil moisture and all water fluxes contributing to changes in soil moisture (rainfall, transpiration, soil evaporation, surface runoff and deep drainage), across the entire Australian continent at a spatial resolution of 5 km. Information is provided through a web interface in three forms:(1) weekly near-real-time reporting,(2) historical monthly time series (1900 to present), and (3) monthly climatologies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 331, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17255479493549795553,13083532364872280275", "cites_id": ["17255479493549795553", "13083532364872280275"], "pub_url": "https://www.cawcr.gov.au/technical-reports/CTR_013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4agSCi3Hd-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 6, "2010": 15, "2011": 20, "2012": 10, "2013": 24, "2014": 19, "2015": 27, "2016": 32, "2017": 30, "2018": 37, "2019": 26, "2020": 29, "2021": 25, "2022": 14, "2023": 11}}
