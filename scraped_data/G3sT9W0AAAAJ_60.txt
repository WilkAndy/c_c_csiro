We use non-linear parameter estimation to determine the vertical profile of the Lagrangian timescale (TL) and partitioning of ET that simultaneously optimise agreement between modelled and measured vertical profiles of temperature, water vapour, carbon dioxide concentrations, and deuterated water vapour for a two-week period in November 2006. High precision real-time trace gas measurements were obtained by FTIR spectroscopy. Modelled temperature and concentration profiles are generated using a Lagrangian dispersion theory combined with source/sink distributions of HDO, H2O, sensible heat, and CO2. These distributions are derived from an isotopically enabled multilayer Soil Vegetation Atmospheric Transfer (SVAT) model subject to multiple \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12321047902676024640", "cites_id": ["12321047902676024640"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192311000578", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QH2Tq8kn_aoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
