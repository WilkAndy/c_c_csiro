Surfactant anions studied were the dodecyl phosphate monoanion, the hexadecyl phosphate dianion, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, dodecanoate, and dodecyl sulfate. Alkali metal ions display only weak selectivity at adsorbed films of all surfactants studied. The binding strength increases in the order Na+ < K+ < Rb+ < Cs+, with the exception of films of dodecanoate, for which the ions have equal affinity, and the hexadecyl phosphate dianion, for which the selectivity sequence is Cs+ < Rb+ < K+ < Na+. By contrast, the binding of quaternary ammonium counterions to adsorbed films of anionic surfactants has a striking dependence on the surfactant headgroup. Results are interpreted using a model which includes solvation of the headgroups \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12187546233813917045", "cites_id": ["12187546233813917045"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la990695l", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dd0gLrrcIqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
