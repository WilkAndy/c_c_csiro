The Pgap component of the model is intended for use in inverting ground-based and airborne gap-frequency data for biometric variables, while the full CanSPART model is intended for application within a one-dimensional multilayer soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer model. Our approach to modelling Pgap is novel because it uses an analytic approximation to the crown porosity, which makes it computationally efficient. Further, it can accommodate any distribution of crown and trunk heights and dimensions, allowing the model to be applied to complex canopy structures with multiple layers. The Pgap model is readily rewritten in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5484954746024348488", "cites_id": ["5484954746024348488"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192312000494", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SMvf7Ud5HkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
