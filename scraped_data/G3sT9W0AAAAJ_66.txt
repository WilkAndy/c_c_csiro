Fire weather conditions are represented by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), calculated from a 12-member regional climate model ensemble. Fuel load is predicted from net primary production, simulated using a land surface model forced by the same regional climate model ensemble. Mean annual fine litter is projected to increase across all ensemble members, by 1.2 to 1.7 t ha\u22121 in temperate areas, 0.3 to 0.5 t ha\u22121 in grassland areas and 0.7 to 1.1 t ha\u22121 in subtropical areas. Ensemble changes in annual cumulative FFDI vary widely, from 57 to 550 in temperate areas, \u2212186 to 1372 in grassland areas and \u2212231 to 907 in subtropical areas. These results suggest that uncertainty in FFDI projections will be underestimated if only a single driving model is used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13430387822896014692", "cites_id": ["13430387822896014692"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1808-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZOVyU5FSYroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 18, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
