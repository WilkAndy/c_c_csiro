The situation is exemplified by the vast inland region of Australia, the driest inhabited continent. Using a global model, Poulter et al.(2014) inferred that Australian ecosystems contributed 57% of a record global carbon uptake anomaly in 2011 and have entered a regime of the enhanced sensitivity to rainfall since the mid-1990s. Here, we present new observation-based evidence confirming a significant role of Australian ecosystems in the 2011 carbon sink anomaly. Our results do not, however, support a shift in sensitivity of vegetation activity to rainfall. We upscaled carbon and water fluxes from 14 sites around Australia, using a fine spatial resolution (0.05) implementation of the CABLE biogeochemical land surface model. We used model data fusion to constrain biospheric fluxes and stores using remotely sensed vegetation cover (Zhu et al., 2013) and formal parameter estimation using the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt method (Doherty, 2004) to minimize residuals between predictions and observations of streamflow from 416 gauged catchments,(CO2 and H2O) ecosystem fluxes from 14 sites of the OzFlux network (Isaac, 2014), litterfall, soil, litter and biomass carbon pools. The analysis is updated from Haverd et al.(2013), the only published assessment of Australian biospheric carbon balance making the full use of relevant regional observation sources.Disregarding land-use effects, we estimate that terrestrial ecosystems in Australia absorbed 0.4 \u00c6 0.2 [2r] Pg C in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4409237975083716803", "cites_id": ["4409237975083716803"], "pub_url": "https://asset-pdf.scinapse.io/prod/2203879532/2203879532.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wxAHw5PCMD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
