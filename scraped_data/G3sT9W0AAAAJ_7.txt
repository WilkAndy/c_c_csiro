Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary in order to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere-atmosphere exchange from the flux tower network. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM), we provide here a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing datasets, and sets of predictor variables were employed. Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent among FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles (R2 > 0.94 at 1\u00b0 spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs are outside the FLUXCOM range for 70 % of the land surface. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008\u20132010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC yr\u22121 with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations of independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise R2 ~ 0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel wise R2 ~ 0.6). Seasonal variations of FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions (R2 > 0.92). Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 271, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1844218653022740654", "cites_id": ["1844218653022740654"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/1343/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ruCRBRj7lxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 37, "2021": 73, "2022": 105, "2023": 53}}
