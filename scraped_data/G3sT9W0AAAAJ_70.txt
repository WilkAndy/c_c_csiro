However, only few studies have focused on the ecological extreme events and their drivers in China. In this study, we carried out an analysis of negative extreme events in gross primary productivity (GPP) in China and the sub-regions during 1982\u20132015, using monthly GPP simulated by 12 process-based models (TRENDYv6) and an observation-based model (Yao-GPP). Extremes were defined as the negative 5th percentile of GPP anomalies, which were further merged into individual extreme events using a three-dimensional contiguous algorithm. Spatio-temporal patterns of negative GPP anomalies were analyzed by taking the 1000 largest extreme events into consideration. Results showed that the effects of extreme events decreased annual GPP by 2.8% (i.e. 208 TgC year\u22121) in TRENDY \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13921659636705691385", "cites_id": ["13921659636705691385"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819231930173X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-Ya88a2rM8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 10, "2023": 8}}
