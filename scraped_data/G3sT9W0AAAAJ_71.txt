Here, we review approaches to overcome this model deficiency by explicitly accounting for gm, which comprises the re\u2010adjustment of photosynthetic parameters and a model describing the variation of gm in dependence of environmental conditions. An explicit representation of gm causes changes in the response of photosynthesis to environmental factors, foremost leaf temperature, and ambient CO2 concentration, which are most pronounced when gm is small. These changes in leaf\u2010level photosynthesis translate into a stronger climate and CO2 response of gross primary productivity (GPP) and transpiration at the global scale. The results from two independent studies show \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9046079419875103569", "cites_id": ["9046079419875103569"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.14587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UZOg300hin0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
