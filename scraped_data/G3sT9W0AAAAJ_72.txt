A realistic representation of processes governing carbon allocation and phenology for the two defining elements of savanna vegetation (namely trees and grasses) may be a key to understanding variations in tree\u2013grass partitioning in time and space across the savanna biome worldwide. Here we present a new approach for modelling coupled phenology and carbon allocation, applied to competing tree and grass plant functional types. The approach accounts for a temporal shift between assimilation and growth, mediated by a labile carbohydrate store. This is combined with a method to maximize long-term net primary production (NPP) by optimally partitioning plant growth between fine roots and (leaves  stem). The computational efficiency of the analytic method used here allows it to be uniquely and readily applied at regional scale, as required, for example, within the framework of a global biogeochemical model.We demonstrate the approach by encoding it in a new simple carbon\u2013water cycle model that we call HAVANA (Hydrology and Vegetation-dynamics Algorithm for Northern Australia), coupled to the existing POP (Population Orders Physiology) model for tree demography and disturbance-mediated heterogeneity. HAVANA-POP is calibrated using monthly remotely sensed fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and eddy-covariance-based estimates of carbon and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10397170315869933640", "cites_id": ["10397170315869933640"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/13/761/2016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SNCp0lArSpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
