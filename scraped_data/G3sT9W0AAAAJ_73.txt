Both the singlet and triplet removal processes yield emission from vibrationally excited CO2 and H2CO, together with a weak component from CO. The production rate of CO2 and H2CO was measured to be the same for the singlet and triplet processes and close to the rate of removal of 3CH 2 by O2, and the emission intensity was essentially unchanged by quenching the singlet to the triplet in collisions with Ar. We conclude that 1CH 2 is quenched to 3CH 2 in collisions with O2 before reaction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16643696550296031974", "cites_id": ["16643696550296031974"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261403003853", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5hLKldRJ-uYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
