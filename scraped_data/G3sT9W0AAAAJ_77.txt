However, no direct observations of global GPP exist, and estimates rely on models that are constrained by observations at various spatial and temporal scales. Here, we assess the consistency in GPP from global products which extend for more than three decades; two observation\u2010based approaches, the upscaling of FLUXNET site observations (FLUXCOM) and a remote sensing derived light use efficiency model (RS\u2010LUE), and from a suite of terrestrial biosphere models (TRENDYv6). At local scales, we find high correlations in annual GPP among the products, with exceptions in tropical and high northern latitudes. On longer time scales, the products agree on the direction of trends over 58% of the land, with large increases across northern latitudes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7520502657269724950", "cites_id": ["7520502657269724950"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GB006613", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FnfxSlIxXmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 10, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
