The major drivers of enhanced  remain unclear and intensely debated, with land-use change,  fertilization and warming being identified as likely contributors. We integrated -flux data from two atmospheric inversions (consistent with atmospheric records) and from 11 state-of-the-art land-surface models (LSMs) to evaluate the relative importance of individual contributors to trends and drivers of the  of  fluxes for 1980\u20132015. The LSMs generally reproduce the latitudinal increase in  trends within the inversions range. Inversions and LSMs attribute  increase to boreal Asia and Europe due to enhanced vegetation productivity (in LSMs) and point to contrasting effects of  fertilization (positive) and warming (negative) on . Our results do not support land-use change as a key contributor to the increase in . The sensitivity of simulated microbial respiration to temperature in LSMs explained biases in  trends, which suggests that  could help to constrain model turnover times."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=389771493382835272", "cites_id": ["389771493382835272"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/12361/2019/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SEyorhu_aAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
