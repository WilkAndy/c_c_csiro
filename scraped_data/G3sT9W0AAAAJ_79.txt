Here we quantify observed sensitivities using a well-calibrated terrestrial biosphere model and data for the Australian continent, and thereby infer likely changes to the water and carbon cycles under specified scenarios for future changes in the drivers. We find: (1) evapotranspiration (ET) has a large positive sensitivity to P, a positive sensitivity to T, and a negative sensitivity to CO2 through increased plant water use efficiency with rising CO2. Consequently, likely changes in T and CO2 over the next half century will have opposite and nearly cancelling effects on ET. (2) Runoff has a large sensitivity to P (positive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10301338791005148564", "cites_id": ["10301338791005148564"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192313001779", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lFXQNA219Y4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
