Recent evidence from global terrestrial biosphere modelling and satellite-based inversion of atmospheric CO 2 point to a large role of Australian ecosystems in global carbon cycle variability, including a large contribution from Australia to the record land sink of 2011. However the specific mechanisms governing this variability, and their bioclimatic distribution within Australia, have not been identified. Here we provide a regional assessment, based on best available observational data, of IAV in the Australian terrestrial carbon cycle and the role of Australia in the record land sink anomaly of 2011. We find that IAV in Australian net carbon uptake is dominated by semi-arid ecosystems in the east of the continent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17057113539532397283", "cites_id": ["17057113539532397283"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/054013/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:45pVSWQKt-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 4}}
