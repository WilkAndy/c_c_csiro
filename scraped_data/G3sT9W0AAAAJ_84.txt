Larger temporal and spatial drought conditions are predicted in future. The temperate south east coastal zone is characterized by dense forests of Eucalyptus. Drought conditions have implications for the functioning of these indigenous ecosystems, and for emissions of reactive gases that are upwind of major metropolitan regions along the eastern coast. Here, we focus on the impact of drought on the emission of isoprene, a volatile organic compound emitted by a range of trees and shrubs. Previous model calculations grossly overestimate observations of the isoprene mixing ratio, potentially due to overestimated emission factors for native vegetation, but could also be due to drought-induced isoprene emission reductions. We develop the implementation of the Model of Emissions of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10609936328854783451", "cites_id": ["10609936328854783451"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231019302535", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:28XmkuAQPpMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
