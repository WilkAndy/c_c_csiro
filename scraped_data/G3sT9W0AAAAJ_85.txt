At this challenging site we examined half-hourly exchanges of the turbulent energy balance components between the surface and atmosphere over an 18-month period. Detailed estimates of the storage flux components were made, with emphasis on the biomass heat flux components. Near complete closure was attained for the site, with the best surface energy balance (SEB) closure occurring in summer and poorest in autumn, 0.96 and 0.84, respectively. The addition of storage fluxes significantly improved closure by 6\u201310%. Storage of heat within the vegetation and air column were found to be the two largest components of the total storage flux.
