Here, we used three combinations of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways (SSP1xRCP26, SSP3xRCP60, and SSP5xRCP85) as input to three dynamic global vegetation models to assess the impacts and associated uncertainty on several ecosystem functions: terrestrial carbon storage and fluxes, evapotranspiration, surface albedo, and runoff. We also performed sensitivity simulations in which we kept either land use or climate (including atmospheric CO2) constant from year 2015 on to calculate the isolated land use versus climate effects. By the 2080\u20132099 period, carbon storage increases by up to 87 \u00b1 47 Gt (SSP1xRCP26) compared to present day, with large spatial variance across scenarios and models. Most of the carbon uptake is attributed to drivers beyond future land use and climate change \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8782937022615477607", "cites_id": ["8782937022615477607"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018EF001123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z12fJbBC43kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 8}}
