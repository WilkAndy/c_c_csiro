Isotopic measurements of N2O have provided an invaluable insight into understanding its atmospheric sources and sinks. The preference for 15N fractionation between the central and terminal positions (the \u201csite preference\u201d) is particularly valuable because it depends principally on the processes involved in N2O production or consumption, rather than the 15N content of the substrate from which it is formed. Despite the value of measurements of the site preference, there is no internationally recognized standard reference material of accurately known and accepted site preference, and there has been some lack of agreement in published studies aimed at providing such a standard. Previous work has been based on isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS); in this work we provide an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17890554642994083115", "cites_id": ["17890554642994083115"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac802371c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K7Vg2qgESPgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
