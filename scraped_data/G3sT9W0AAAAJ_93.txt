The Semi-analytic Pgap And Radiative Transfer (CanSPART) model is flexibly formulated using distributions of tree height, crown and stem dimensions and can be used for \u2018bottom-up\u2019 or \u2018top-down\u2019 modelling of gap profiles. Gap probabilities derived from a ground-based scanning lidar are used to validate the output of the model. Direct comparisons of Pgap are made at a range of zenith angles as well as mean foliage profiles calculated from a combination of profiles at multiple angles. Test sites include one pine plantation and several eucalypt woodland sites with varying density, structural complexity, layering and clumping. It is shown that this model performs better in clumped canopies than a simple exponential model and there is agreement with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2086760088749341387", "cites_id": ["2086760088749341387"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192312000512", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y_pdnT6p9RwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
