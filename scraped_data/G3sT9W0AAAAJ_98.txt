Mauna Loa (MLO) station (20\u00b0N, 156\u00b0W), which has the longest continuous northern hemisphere CO2 record, shows an increasing SCA before the 1980s (p < .01), followed by no significant change thereafter. We analyzed the potential driving factors of SCA slowing\u2010down, with an ensemble of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) coupled with an atmospheric transport model. We found that slowing\u2010down of SCA at MLO is primarily explained by response of net biome productivity (NBP) to climate change, and by changes in atmospheric circulations. Through NBP, climate change increases SCA at MLO before the 1980s and decreases it afterwards. The effect of climate change on the slowing\u2010down of SCA at MLO is mainly exerted by intensified drought stress acting to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "G3sT9W0AAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16666493479472601090", "cites_id": ["16666493479472601090"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15162", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AhhUR4RHS-cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
