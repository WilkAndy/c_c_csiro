The failings of the relevant literature to satisfy the needs of present and future automated design techniques are highlighted.The different approaches currently available for evaluating effective lengths are reviewed. The eigenvalue method which establishes an overall structure instability criteria is considered. The remainder of the methods all involve expressing the effective lengths of a member in terms of the member stiffness and the stiffnesses provided by the end supports. The importance of obtaining accurate stiffness values representing the member end conditions becomes clear from the formulations obtained and the examples presented in the paper. A method of estimating suitable stiffness values during a typical optimization or automated design procedure is suggested. One of the approaches for evaluating effective lengths is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6625930280978167487", "cites_id": ["6625930280978167487"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02630258408970345", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vzY1IHwI9FsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1}}
