The objective was to obtain a minimum weight design by varying the member cross-sectional dimensions and the coordinate positions of the joints of the structure employing stress constraints formulated using the Code. To arrive at a design algorithm that yielded practical designs, several features were introduced into the algorithm which included provision for uniformly distributed loading and the grouping of member cross-sectional properties or joint coordinates as single design variables. Example structures are given and the design reviewed with respect to the shape optimization of the structure and the resulting saving in weight."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14898479423935510135", "cites_id": ["14898479423935510135"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978040801440350015X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d3YkvRkIws4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1}}
