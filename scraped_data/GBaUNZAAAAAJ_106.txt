Palladium atomic co-ordinates were obtained from a three-dimensional Patterson synthesis. All other atoms, except for hydrogen, were located in subsequent Fourier syntheses. Six cycles of fullmatrix least-squares refinement, in the space group P4, 2, 2, using individual isotropic temperature factors, gave an R value of 0.12. The palladium atom has a square planar environment made up of two chlorine atoms, and two nitrogens from the ethylenediamine part of the EDTA with the carboxyl groups uncomplexed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=788519031514747666", "cites_id": ["788519031514747666"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/1967/c1/c19670001236", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ElMSpOFh8QoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1976": 1, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
