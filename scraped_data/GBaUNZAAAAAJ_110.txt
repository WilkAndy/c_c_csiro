Intensities were estimated visually. No corrections were applied for absorption, extinction, or anomalous dispersion.Silver atomic co-ordinates were obtained from a three-dimensional Patterson synthesis. The remaining atoms, except hydrogen, were located from subsequent Fourier synthesis. Four cycles of full-matrix least-squares refinement, using individual isotropic temperature factors, gave a conventional R of 0.19. Scale factors obtained by a least-squares method of fitting I F, I to I Fc I were used in the refinement, and were in close agreement with scale factors obtained by correlation of reflections common to lzkn (n= &ti), and Okl.
