The Soret coefficients obtained from thermal diffusion experiments conducted at 25\u00b0C are reported. Heats of transport have been estimated based on the Debye-H\u00fcckel theory and the molar entropies of transport, calculated. Results of the present work have been compared with the Soret data for MgCl2 and CaCl2. It is suggested that the solvent exchange effect may account for the differences in the Soret effect observed between the pairs (Mg+2, Ca+2) and (MgEDTA\u22122, CaEDTA\u22122)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14236246746501806249", "cites_id": ["14236246746501806249"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00651856", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qfgMNP1OkcUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1}}
