The substituted phenyliridium complexes were isolated and characterised, the m-/p-isomer ratios being ca. 3 1 for X= I, Br and Cl, 2 1 for X= CF 3, 3 2 for X= CN, and 1 1 for X= NO 2, COMe and CO 2 Me; only the m-isomer was obtained m-for X= NH 2. No o-substituted products could be detected. Reaction at higher temperature for longer times gave [C 5 Me 5 Ir (C 6 H 4 X) 2 (DMSO)](X= H, Cl, I), which were also characterised. The reactivity of C 6 H 5 X to 1b decreases in the order X= I> NO 2> CF 3> CN> CO 2 Me> COMe> Br> H> OMe> Cl> F> NH 2; iodobenzene is the fastest but reaction does not occur at the Ph\ue5f8 I bond. Deuteriation studies show that one CH 3 D is formed for every 1b reacted with C 6 D 6. Complex 1b exchanges with free DMSO and small quantities of DMSO inhibit the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1154054332531958633", "cites_id": ["1154054332531958633"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022328X85870108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aWMRDk0GBBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
