The orthorhombic unit cell, space group Pbca, (D2n15) has dimensions a= 22\u00b765(2), b= 16\u00b737(2), c= 11\u00b733(2)\u00c5, with Z= 4. The structure was solved by direct methods (tangent formula) and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques to R 0\u00b716. The 1,1,4,4-tetraethylpiperazinium ion is at a centre of symmetry. The structure consists of alternate blocks of p-nitroaniline and [1,1,4,4-tetraethylpiperazinium] dichloride along the a direction. Hydrogen bonds link the chloride ions to pairs of p-nitroaniline molecules."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6989402272671130136", "cites_id": ["6989402272671130136"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1970/j2/j29700001317", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GOLe5lVY_2AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
