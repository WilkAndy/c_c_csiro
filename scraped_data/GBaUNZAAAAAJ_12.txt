Yet recent scholarship has warned that much of this technical work treats problematic features of the status quo as fixed, and fails to address deeper patterns of injustice and inequality. While acknowledging these critiques, we posit that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems --- roles whose value can be recognized even from a perspective that aspires toward fundamental social change. In this paper, we articulate four such roles, through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16984218755589931789", "cites_id": ["16984218755589931789"], "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DQN30vgQtOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 34, "2021": 52, "2022": 83, "2023": 23}}
