The package provides three S3 generics: tidy, which summarizes a model's statistical findings such as coefficients of a regression; augment, which adds columns to the original data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments; and glance, which provides a one-row summary of model-level statistics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12261473416409824482", "cites_id": ["12261473416409824482"], "pub_url": "https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2018-03-30/web/packages/broom/broom.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4rwAsBuBKaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
