Bus mileage, passenger numbers and operating costs are examined. A general state of flux is revealed with a trend towards reduction in operating costs and decline in patronage. The prospects for deregulation of London buses and the Scottish bus group are discussed. Details are given of the present state of ownership after a spate of takeovers. A survey was commissioned of bus industry executives, 84 in the public sector and 60 independents, to gauge their views on future developments. The results are analysed and several trends identified. Questions covered expectations of changes in fares, mileage, patronage and employment. Most companies spent less than 2% of their revenue on advertising and there was little evidence of planning ahead more than 2 years. Few companies planned expansion or diversification into other businesses and many takeovers were expected. Preparations by some companies with regard to the single European market are noted as is the involvement of the bus and coach council. In reviewing the manufacturing sector an upturn in business is seen with an emphasis on big buses rather than minibuses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6412206957171519557", "cites_id": ["6412206957171519557"], "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/313871", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RTB_FEG8_FgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
