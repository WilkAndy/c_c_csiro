Reform efforts aim to shrink jails by incarcerating fewer people\u2014particularly poor, low-risk defendants and racial minorities. Many jurisdictions are embracing pretrial risk assessment instruments\u2014statistical tools that use historical data to forecast which defendants can safely be released\u2014as a centerpiece of reform. Now, many are questioning the extent to which pretrial risk assessment instruments actually serve reform goals. Existing scholarship and debate centers on how the instruments themselves may reinforce racial disparities and on how their opaque algorithms may frustrate due process interests.  This Article highlights three underlying challenges that have yet to receive the attention they require. First, today\u2019s risk assessment tools lead to what we term \u201czombie predictions.\u201d That is, predictive models trained on data from older bail regimes are blind to the risk-reducing benefits of recent bail reforms. This may cause predictions that systematically overestimate risk. Second, \u201cdecision-making frameworks\u201d that mediate the court system\u2019s use of risk estimates embody crucial moral judgments, yet currently escape appropriate public scrutiny. Third, in the long-term, these tools risk giving an imprimatur of scientific objectivity to ill-defined concepts of \u201cdangerousness,\u201d may entrench the Supreme Court\u2019s historically recent blessing of preventive detention for dangerousness, and could pave the way for an increase in preventive detention.  Pretrial risk assessment instruments, as they are currently built and used, cannot safely be assumed to support \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17931649781287431109&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
