Proper design and analysis of these experiments require statistical models and techniques that consider the specific nature of sequencing data, which typically consists of a matrix of read counts per feature. An issue of particular importance to the development of these methods is the role of read depth in statistical accuracy and power. The depth of an experiment affects the power to make biological conclusions, meaning an experiment design must consider the tradeoff between cost, power, and the number of samples that are examined. Similarly, per-gene read depth affects each gene's power and accuracy, and must be taken into account in any downstream analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/d28e79edd784f637e6d2e314649c3404/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P5M4Sk0SlHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
