Its working principle is explained and a useful application in combination with the dual wavelength method for topography measurement is presented. Advantages of the dual wavelength method compared to other optical topography measurement techniques, the experimental procedure and the analysis of the data are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8413/84130O/Ptychography-applied-to-optical-metrology/10.1117/12.977959.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gu5rd84a1OoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
