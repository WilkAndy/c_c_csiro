From a Chinese food festival in town to the young Chinese couple you met recently, the Chinese wedding you passed in the park to the students from China on the university campus, the Mandarin-speaking Prime Minister to the billion-dollar resource deals every second week, a cultural infusion is occurring alongside China\u2019s growing economic and political importance for Australia.Generally this is a very good thing, and a positive sign that Australia has come some way from the Immigration Restriction Act of the White Australia Policy, and early twentieth century racial characterisations of the Chinese as agents of opium, vice and disease. Of course, with Hansonism not long behind us, the Cronulla riots, bashings of Indian students, and the popularity of shows like \u2018Border Security\u2019, it would be na\u00efve to think fear of the \u2018Other\u2019does not still lurk below the surface, or indeed parade across the political landscape with its flag hoisted high. But when \u2018Constructivist\u2019political theorists speak of the intersubjective constitution of social configurations in the international arena, I\u2019m pretty sure the changing relationship between Australia and China fits the bill."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/55190838/Chinese_Wind_of_Change_for_Australian_Society.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
