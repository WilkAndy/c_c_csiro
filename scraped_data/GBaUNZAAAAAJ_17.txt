This was part of a research programme aimed at examining the potential for virally vectored immunocontraception to limit the abundance of rabbits (e.g. using a recombinant myxoma virus) and other mammalian pests. Sterility levels were 0%, 40%, 60% and 80% of all females in year 1, with a similar proportion of female recruits sterilized surgically in subsequent years. 2.\u2002There was a significant decrease in rabbit productivity with increasing sterility level. This was overcome by increased survival of kittens and adults on the high\u2010sterility sites, such that the base\u2010level numbers of rabbits were maintained, and mean annual rates of increase (r) were near zero for all treatments in all years. However, in the high\u2010sterility populations this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8139595569490342333", "cites_id": ["8139595569490342333"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2664.2000.00471.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vbHQhgun9XAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 5, "2006": 11, "2007": 12, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
