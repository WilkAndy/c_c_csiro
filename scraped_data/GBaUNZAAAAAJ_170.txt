One trend is towards the growth of integrated carriers providing a wide range of services to meet all the transport requirements of one company. Considerable changes are expected in European distribution patterns, including:(1) the development of hub and satellite warehouse systems;(2) the emergence of huge centralised distribution centres for some companies, with road, rail and air services sharing the distribution burden;(3) stronger links between road and rail freight movement;(4) combined road-rail transport, using piggyback and swap-bodies. Many companies will have the key objective of making their distribution systems as efficient as possible. This will require:(1) a more intermodal approach;(2) improved vehicle utilisation;(3) higher quality of service;(4) better trained drivers;(5) a move towards a higher profile for the road freight industry and a greater awareness of the part that it plays. Other expected trends include:(1) more international mergers and acquisitions of distribution and transport companies;(2) the use of more sophisticated computer systems;(3) increased investment in road transport and distribution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/353244", "cites_per_year": {}}
