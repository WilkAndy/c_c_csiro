Traffic increases of up to 142% are predicted which take account of the effect of the channel tunnel and single European market. 6 billion are being set aside for improving the nation's network of motorways and trunk roads alone. The government also aims to shorten the time involved from concept to completion by a third aiming to complete the first new roads in the early 1990's. Priority will be given to relieving congestion on the most heavily used parts of the network with the m25, m1 and many other motorways being widened. A number of major route corridor studies are also being undertaken and further surveys are proposed. Reaction is described as mostly positive from road haulage associations. Criticisms are however made by the rtpi (royal town planning institute), the association of district councils and transport 2000 and the institute of civil engineers has called for a national transport co-ordinating group. The possibility of private companies tendering for roads or for the construction of privately funded toll roads is also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://trid.trb.org/view/313866", "cites_per_year": {}}
