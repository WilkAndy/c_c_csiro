The reactivity of ((eta/sup 5/-C/sub 5/H/sub 5/)Ru(eta/sup 4/-C/sub 8/H/sub 12/)Cl) and its derivatives has allowed (i) the facile synthesis of a range of cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) complexes and an investigation of their chemistry, (ii) the development of a synthetic route to organoruthenium(IV) complexes and the study of their reactivity, and (iii) an entry into a potentially rich chemistry of mononuclear ruthenacyclopentatriene and ruthena-cyclopentadiene complexes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/7127118", "cites_per_year": {}}
