Strong acids reversibly protonate the electron-rich centers in 2 and 4 giving the cationic hydride complexes [M (7? 5-C5Me5) 2H]+. The complexes 1-10 have been characterizedby elemental analysis and by spectroscopic (IR and 4H and 13C NMR) techniques. The crystal and molecular structures of 2 and 4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystals of these sandwich complexes are isostructural, space group P2l/m. Abnormally high thermal parameters indicate the presence of disorder across the mirror plane. Although the position of the molecules across the crystallographic mirror plane implies a Z) 6/,(eclipsed) molecular geometryin both cases, this may only reflect the average structure. The average metal-carbon distances are 2.17 (1) and 2.18 (1) \u00c1 for Ru-C and Os-C, respectively; d (CC)= 1.43 (1) \u00c1 and d (CC (Me))= 1.52 (1) \u00c1.
