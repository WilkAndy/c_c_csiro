Along these lines, this paper presents a new interactive reliability-based CAD optimization procedure for plastic framed structures. Both loads and strengths are assumed to be random variables. Load correlations and resistance correlations are also considered. The procedure used to obtain the best design is based on the optimization of the total expected weight for a specified probability of failure of the structure.Dan M Frangopol took his Ph D at LiEge University, Belgium, in 1976. He joined the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1983 as an Associate Professor. His background covers two major areas of research: structural reliability and structural optimization. He has lectured in several countries and has published \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9429719340275206985&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
