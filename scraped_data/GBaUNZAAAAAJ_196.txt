We have developed a model of the likelihood of post-election controversy based on these factors and a novel tool to explore the model in an interactive map. Currently the tool can be used retrospectively for the 2006 House of Representatives elections. The map highlights the Congressional districts the model predicts to have been at high risk for controversy. We intend to apply the model in the future to the 2008 elections to help inform policy decisions relevant to maintaining voter confidence and actual integrity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4422881446819876435&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U05dET47YT0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
