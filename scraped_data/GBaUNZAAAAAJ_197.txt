When we see the 1980s (John Cusack) version, Brian has the social deficits, inappropriate disclosures (boundary deficits), blunted affect, persistent hallucinatory experiences, and negative symptoms associated with a chronic psychotic disorder. However, the portrayal in Love & Mercy is not consistent with schizophrenia, and even less so with paranoid schizophrenia (no longer a subtype recognized in the DSM-5). Brian\u2019s lack of a conversational filter, directness, and base earnestness as a person endear him both to Melinda and viewers. The scene where Brian locks himself in a Cadillac with Melinda, detailing his brother\u2019s death by drowning, and the dinner, where he describes Murry\u2019s physical abuse of him, are typical of how someone with a chronic psychotic disorder would communicate such sensitive personal information. Brian states the \u201cfacts\u201d in a bland manner that is incongruent with the severity of what he is describing. In real life, Brian has revealed that his actual diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, depressed type (Cooper & Friedman, 2009). This is a very reasonable conclusion given the symptoms demonstrated in the movie, especially if we are to exclude substance-induced mood or psychotic disorders from a differential diagnosis. The Beach Boys, incongruously never popular with real surfers, are as interesting, complex, and talented as any other musical group from the 1960s. Paul McCartney has cited Pet Sounds as his favourite album of all time, and an inspiration for Beatles\u2019 albums that followed.Love & \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpac.ca/_Library/Journal_Issues/Spring2017.pdf#page=15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:io_yzW8CONMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
