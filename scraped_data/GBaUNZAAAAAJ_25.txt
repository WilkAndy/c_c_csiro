Species of small native mammals (e.g. dasyurids, rodents) and geckos were significantly (P < 0.03) more prevalent in the diet of pastoral cats, and rural cats consumed greater (P < 0.03) quantities of introduced rodents and rabbits. Several other groups of native animals (e.g. snakes, skinks, agamids) were also more prevalent in the stomachs of pastoral cats (P < 0.10). Birds and orthopterans were important food items to cats from both habitats. There was reasonable dietary overlap (mean = 0.71) between the cats from both habitats, but the dietary breadth of the pastoral cats (mean = 0.44) was two-fold greater than that of the rural cats (mean = 0.21). These findings are compared with previous studies, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15027093100893650059", "cites_id": ["15027093100893650059"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/wr9960475", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:izx97Y71itAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
