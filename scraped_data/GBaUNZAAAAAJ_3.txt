As described by Hadley Wickham (Wickham 2014), tidy data has a specific structure:\u2022 each variable is a column\u2022 each observation is a row\u2022 each type of observational unit is a tableTidy data sets allow manipulation with a standard set of \u201ctidy\u201d tools, including popular packages such as dplyr (Wickham, Francois, and RStudio 2015), ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, and RStudio 2016), and broom (Robinson et al. 2015). These tools do not yet, however, have the infrastructure to work fluently with text data and natural language processing tools. In developing this package, we provide functions and supporting data sets to allow conversion of text to and from tidy formats, and to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and existing text mining packages."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 678, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14258410385410868048", "cites_id": ["14258410385410868048"], "pub_url": "https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00037.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UMMnhLMM4MUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 15, "2018": 44, "2019": 97, "2020": 116, "2021": 162, "2022": 169, "2023": 68}}
