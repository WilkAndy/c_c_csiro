As part of the design of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of arthroscopic surgery for FAI syndrome, we developed a protocol for non-operative care and evaluated its feasibility.In phase one, we developed a protocol for non-operative care for FAI in the UK National Health Service (NHS), through a process of systematic review and consensus gathering. In phase two, the protocol was tested in an internal pilot RCT for protocol adherence and adverse events.The final protocol, called Personalised Hip Therapy (PHT), consists of four core components led by physiotherapists: detailed patient assessment, education and advice, help with pain relief and an exercise-based programme that is individualised, supervised and progressed over time. PHT is delivered over 12\u201326\u2005weeks in 6\u201310 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11675512353275827152", "cites_id": ["11675512353275827152"], "pub_url": "https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/19/1217.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0NOwM6DAB6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
