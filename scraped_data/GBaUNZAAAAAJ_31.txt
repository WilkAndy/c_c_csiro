Initial electrochemical measurements have shown that the rate of mass transfer and prevailing hydrodynamic conditions may best be related in terms of dimensionless numbers:St = 0\u00b7169 Sc\u22120\u00b767 Re\u22120\u00b734where St, Sc and Re are the Stanton, Schmidt and Reynolds numbers respectively. Limiting current densities of up to 174 mA/cm2 (162 A/ft2) have been attained for 1500 rev/min in 0\u00b707M solution. The microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the same systematic growth mode occurred at all conditions. At current densities greater than 0\u00b77 iL tree-like or dendritic growths tended to form but for deposit thicknesses less than 2 \u03bcm this only becomes significant for currents close to the limiting value."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11645531783016656887", "cites_id": ["11645531783016656887"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00202967.1970.11870127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9686u3Q9naEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 3, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
