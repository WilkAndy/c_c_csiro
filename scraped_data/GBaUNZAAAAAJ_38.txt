We use a computational model previously validated against experimental results and ab initio quantum calculations (Lienke, A.; Klatt, G.; Robinson, D.; Koch, K. R.; Naidoo, K. J. Inorg. Chem. 2001, 40, 2352\u22122357) to investigate the nature of the hydration shells about simple platinum group metal chloro complexes ([PtCl6]2-, [RhCl6]3-, [PtCl4]2-, and [PdCl4]2-). Our simulations show that the hydration shells surrounding these complexes are symmetric and take on familiar geometric forms. We find that only the [RhCl6]3- complex has a clearly defined second hydration shell while the [PtCl6]2-, [PtCl4]2-, and [PdCl4]2- second hydration shells are more diffuse.
