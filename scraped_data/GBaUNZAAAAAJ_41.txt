This oxidative addition/rearrangement process is approximately 100 times slower than the reaction of thecorresponding allyl chloride, 1-chloro-2-methylprop-2-ene, with [(7? 5-C5H5) Ru (7) 4-C3H12) Cl]. The thermal rearrangement of V-vinyl to r; 3-allyl ligands has previously been proposed to occur via hydride aliene intermediates; however, the lack of/5-vinylic or/5-allylic protonsin this system would tend toimplicate an alternate mechanism such as V-vinyl to^-allyl conversion via a 1, 3-hydrogen shift.
