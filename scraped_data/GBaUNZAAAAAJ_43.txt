The over-all mass-transfer equation has been calculated by considering a turbulent diffusion coefficient enhanced by eddying effects and then solving Fick's law for the concentration distribution in each zone. The mass-transfer equation, in dimensionless form, is "}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5890293805680608755", "cites_id": ["5890293805680608755"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013468672900291", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:88VGFgKHvlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
