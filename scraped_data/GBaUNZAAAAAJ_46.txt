Peak densities followed periods of high rainfall and pasture biomass. The breeding season was prolonged, often extending from at least April to November, with some pregnancies occurring outside this period. Fecundity, determined by the autopsy of pregnant offsite rabbits and the known length of each breeding season, appeared to be relatively high, with the potential for 34\u201339 kittens doe-1 year-1; however, because not all females are pregnant in all months, the overall productivity of these populations was estimated at 25\u201330 kittens adult female-1 year-1. Exponential rates of increase varied from 0.13 to 0.30 during the breeding periods and \u20130.05 to \u20130.14 during the nonbreeding season. Kitten survival was generally low whereas some adults lived for more than 5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6230375620442100668", "cites_id": ["6230375620442100668"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR97066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vJO06Z29dlYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
