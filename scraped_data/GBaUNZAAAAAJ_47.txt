The absorption spectrum in acetonitrile consists of two main bands each showing evidence of splitting. Absorption maxima (mp) and extinction coefficients (cm-l 1. mole-I in parentheses) are as follows: 515 (5880), 435sh (3830), 325 (14600), 295sh (13700). Magnetic susceptibility measurements by the Gouy method give a value of 5.9 BM, thus showing the iron to be in the high-spin state. Though this is consistent with other examples of iron (111) in complexes of higher coordination number, lower coordination numbers could also produce the moment observed here. It is interesting that the X-ray work of Hoard et aL4 has confirmed seven-coordination in the [Fe (OH,) Y] anion (Y \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6900161011282204911", "cites_id": ["6900161011282204911"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch9681365", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:79h5kuFLwl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
