The first week involved the arrival of the medical team over the first weekend that the Games village was open. The sailing team arrived at a similar time and a few other athletes arrived during the week. This week was largely taken up with setting up the medical room in a bare basement area, reconnaissance of the village and Olympic site, attendance at training as required, and providing a service to those already in the village. The second week, which was the week leading up to the opening ceremony, was very busy with the arrival of the remaining athletes including men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s hockey at the beginning of the week. Attendance at training and warm up games, continuing a day to day service to those in the village, and finishing off any last minute medical assessments and medicine notifications \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13606931915462196053", "cites_id": ["13606931915462196053"], "pub_url": "https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/36/3/229.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VbsMCHyI1bwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
