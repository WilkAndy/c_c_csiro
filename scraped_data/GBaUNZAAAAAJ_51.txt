R= Me; X= Cl reacts stereoselectively with 5a at-78 C in toluene solution, to yield quantitatively a ca. 1: 1 mixture of two isomeric Ir (IIl) metallacyclobutene complexes. Each isomer exhibits a 19F NMR spectrum containing three resonances of relative intensity 2: 1: 1 and a 31P NMR spectrum containing a single resonance. The isomers must therefore have structures 9a and 10a, each possessing a mirror plane which includes themetallacyclic ring and which relates the phosphine ligands. 7 In contrast, tetrafluorocyclo-propene reacts with 5b to give a quantitative yield of a single isomer, whose 19F NMR spectrum exhibits four equal-intensity resonances and whose 31P NMR spectrum shows two inequivalent phosphorus environments. Accordingly, the structure of this isomer is assigned as 11a. 7 In contrast to its \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=590555659713364907", "cites_id": ["590555659713364907"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja00206a025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q8NPXT4TMggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 4, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
