A tripole predictor pattern of warm SST anomalies at low latitudes and to the south of Greenland and cold anomalies off the east coast of North America extending into the central Atlantic leads, in two cases out of three, to negative winter NAO (see Part 2 and Rodwell and Folland 2002, hereafter RF02)\u2013and this was the pattern observed in May 2005 (Fig. 1 (a)). Negative NAO is associated with cold winter temperature anomalies over much of Europe and northern Asia (Osborn 2006). Thus the May 2005 SST pattern signalled a predisposition for a cold winter season over Europe. However, it is important to note that the presence of the tripole pattern does not guarantee a cold winter because a part of the year-to-year variability in seasonal conditions is essentially random and not predictable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15888043719250705061", "cites_id": ["15888043719250705061"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1256/wea.181.06", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pXrQjZWrfdwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 9, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
