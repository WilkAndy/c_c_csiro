Refraction networking is a next-generation censorship circumvention approach that locates proxy functionality in the middle of the network, at participating ISPs or other network operators. We built a high-performance implementation of the TapDance refraction networking scheme and deployed it on four ISP uplinks with an aggregate bandwidth of 100 Gbps. Over one week of operation, our deployment served more than 50,000 real users. The experience demonstrates that TapDance can be practically realized at ISP scale with good performance and at a reasonable cost, potentially paving the way for long-term, large-scale deployments of TapDance or other refraction networking schemes in the future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1796342297733863424", "cites_id": ["1796342297733863424"], "pub_url": "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci17/foci17-paper-frolov_0.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AJhvZ83j7RgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 11, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
