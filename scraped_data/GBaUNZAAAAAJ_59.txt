The last fifteen years in particular have seen major additions to the fund of knowledge concerning the coordination chemistry of metal atoms in a cluster, and how the closely interactive environment in the cluster influences the properties and the reactivity of the cluster complex [8].Much of the interest in metal clusters has been motivated by the possible role of clusters as bridges between molecular chemistry and solid state chemistry, and the belief that this could lead to a greater understanding of surface phenomena and ultimately to the development of novel catalysts [9-121. While the promise of many early discoveries has, however, remained largely unfulfilled in this respect, it is clear that an enormous fund of scientific knowledge has been accumulated which could lay the foundations for future, more realistic appraisals of potential applications. One of the most important recent developments in cluster chemistry has been the recognition of the importance of the reactivity of the metal cluster core and for which the term \u201cbasic metal cluster chemistry\u201d has been coined [13].
