In the clinical analyzer machine, remote-controlled trams transport test packs containing loading/unloading station to a processing/testing station via a carousel and vice versa. In the processing station, a special processor with mechanically-operated rollers mixing shoes, wastegate assembly, magnets, clamp plate and a thermal sealer, process samples in test packs with various reagents to detect an analyte. The carousel holds the test packs during incubation periods and rotates the tested disposable packs past an optical reader which optically senses the presence of an analyte in the sample. Bar code readers are provided to assist in identification of the test pack, patient and sample."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 464, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9395981182149516921", "cites_id": ["9395981182149516921"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US5374395A/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ed5GZho7ZYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 6, "1998": 15, "1999": 15, "2000": 12, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 9, "2004": 12, "2005": 10, "2006": 3, "2007": 10, "2008": 13, "2009": 13, "2010": 17, "2011": 33, "2012": 35, "2013": 31, "2014": 36, "2015": 27, "2016": 26, "2017": 27, "2018": 20, "2019": 19, "2020": 35, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
