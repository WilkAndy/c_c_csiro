The incidence of powdery or dendritic deposits has been related to a transition from charge transfer to mass transfer control of electrodeposition, which for copper is thought to take place at currents of about 0\u00b74 IL. IL is the limiting current density. However, in practice when thin finite deposits are examined the transition may appear at greater values, for instance 0\u00b77 IL. The mass transfer behaviour remains essentially the same at all conditions of turbulent electrodeposition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16551714829598208965", "cites_id": ["16551714829598208965"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00202967.1971.11870160", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xTPEWfGAs-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1973": 1, "1974": 2, "1975": 2, "1976": 2, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
