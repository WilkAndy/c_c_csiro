But once this is achieved how should agencies go about attempting to exploit this data by proactively identifying criminal events and the actors responsible? The authors will outline an effective generic method that; computationally extracts minimally overlapping contextual subgraphs, then uses these subgraphs as the basis to construct a mesoscopic graph based on the intersections between the subgraphs, enabling knowledge discovery from these data representations for the purpose of maximally disrupting terrorism, organised crime and the broader criminal network."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12838378494631641798", "cites_id": ["12838378494631641798"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13388-018-0031-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xoKIYDgVK7IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
