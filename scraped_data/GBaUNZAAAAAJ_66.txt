The tetragonal unit cell, space group P41212, has dimensions a= 10\u00b719(2), c= 21\u00b702(3)\u00c5, with Z= 4. The structure was refined by least squares to R 0\u00b7106. The molecule possesses a two-fold axis which passes through palladium bisecting Cl\u2013Pd\u2013Cl and N\u2013Pd\u2013N. The co-ordination of palladium is square planar, and links two nitrogens from the ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and two chlorine atoms [Pd\u2013N 2\u00b709(2), Pd\u2013Cl 2\u00b730(1)\u00c5; N\u2013Pd\u2013N, 85\u00b71(9)\u00b0, Cl\u2013Pd\u2013Cl, 90\u00b77(3)\u00b0]. The four planar carboxy-groups of the ligand are not co-ordinated, and make, with the water molecules, a network of hydrogen bonds.
