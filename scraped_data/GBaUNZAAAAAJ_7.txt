It can be treated by arthroscopic hip surgery, including reshaping the hip, or with physiotherapist-led conservative care. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of hip arthroscopy with best conservative care.UK FASHIoN is a pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, done at 23 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. We enrolled patients with femoroacetabular impingement syndrome who presented at these hospitals. Eligible patients were at least 16 years old, had hip pain with radiographic features of cam or pincer morphology but no osteoarthritis, and were believed to be likely to benefit from hip arthroscopy. Patients with bilateral femoroacetabular impingement syndrome were eligible; only the most symptomatic hip was randomly assigned to treatment and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 454, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=597922879206331995", "cites_id": ["597922879206331995"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618312029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WxYs0rA_TAgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 14, "2019": 55, "2020": 99, "2021": 128, "2022": 105, "2023": 42}}
