The XH NMR spectra of complexes 4 exhibit variable temperature behavior, consistent with rotation of the trimethylcyclopropenyl ligand on the NMR time scale. Line shape analysis of the variable temperature spectra leads to values for the free energy of activation (AG*) for this rotation of ca. 60 kJ mol-1, which are insensitive to the nature of the halide or the cyclopentadienyl ligand. These relatively high values of AG* stand in contrast to the maximum value of AG* for triphenylcyclopropenyl rotation estimated previously for an isoelectronic complex [Mo (7? 5-C5H5)(7; 3-C3Ph3)(CO) 2](2). A detailed theoretical analysis at the extended Hiickel level has been carried out for the bonding interactions between both [Ru (Tj5-C5H5) Br2] and [Mo (t? 5-C5H5)(CO) 2] fragments and the [C3H3] ligand. This analysis predicts a significantly higher barrier to cyclopropenyl rotation in the Ru system and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15323839804029667502", "cites_id": ["15323839804029667502"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/om00030a041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rggu0hw3qdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
