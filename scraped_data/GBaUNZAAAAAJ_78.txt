The methods \u2014 sequential linear programming, the feasible direction method and the sequential unconstrained minimization technique \u2014 are applied to a portal frame problem to enable a study of their convergence efficiency to be studied. These methods are used for both the sizing of the structural members and determining the optimum roof pitch. The sequential linear programming method is shown to be particularly efficient for application to structural design problems. Some comments on the development of computer software for structural optimization are also given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14800407211328175013", "cites_id": ["14800407211328175013"], "pub_url": "https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/eb023580/full/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pXtYWvGbZc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
