We did a study to assess its effectiveness and to investigate the mechanism for surgical decompression.We did a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-group trial at 32 hospitals in the UK with 51 surgeons. Participants were patients who had subacromial pain for at least 3 months with intact rotator cuff tendons, were eligible for arthroscopic surgery, and had previously completed a non-operative management programme that included exercise therapy and at least one steroid injection. Exclusion criteria included a full-thickness torn rotator cuff. We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to arthroscopic subacromial decompression \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 412, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=593754794752465830", "cites_id": ["593754794752465830"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673617324571", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ptvnCNdwPQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 41, "2019": 86, "2020": 64, "2021": 88, "2022": 83, "2023": 29}}
