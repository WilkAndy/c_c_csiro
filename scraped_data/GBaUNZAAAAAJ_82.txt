The design variables include member properties and the co-ordinates of the structural joints. The member cross-sectional properties are solely expressed in terms of the member depth which is shown to greatly simplify solution. A number of sample structures are given and the method is shown to give optimum solutions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12988522564206614573", "cites_id": ["12988522564206614573"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0045794984901615", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LViuvHSAQLQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
