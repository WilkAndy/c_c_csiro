His experimental condition was an annulus, in which he generated upward Bowing natural convection and downward Aowing forced convection, and he surmised that \u201cthis must be one of the few situations where an increase in forced convection is the cause of a decrease in the rate of a mass-transfer process\u201d.We are presently involved in a study of the mass-transfer characteristics in a laboratory electro-winning cell, and have observed a similar phenomenon resulting from the interaction of upward-flowing free convection, downward-flowing forced convection generated by the anodic evolution of oxygen bubbles, and the swirling forced convection of a propeller stirrer located below the electrode.
