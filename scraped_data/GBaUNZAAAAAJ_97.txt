The monoclinic unit cell, space group P21/n, has dimensions, a= 12\u00b717(2), b= 19\u00b734(2), c= 6\u00b755(2)\u00c5, \u03b2= 93\u00b70(3)\u00b0, with Z= 4. The structure was refined by least-squares calculations to R 0\u00b719. The cyclohexene ring shows a half-chair conformation, with one carbon on each side of the planar, four-carbon (\u2013CHR\u00b7CH:CH\u00b7CH2\u2013) segment. The isopropenyl group is not planar. The isopropenyl and vinyl groups are trans to one another, and are both associated with the same silver atom (Ag\u2013C, 2\u00b739, 2\u00b759, 2\u00b754, and 2\u00b754 \u00c5). This atom completes its tetrahedral co-ordination by association with the oxygen from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "GBaUNZAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13976546033118740511", "cites_id": ["13976546033118740511"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1970/j2/j29700000965", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HwDw8pCq9sEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1971": 2, "1972": 0, "1973": 0, "1974": 0, "1975": 0, "1976": 0, "1977": 1, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1}}
