Recent work has demonstrated the potential for constructs encoding self\u2010complementary \u2018hairpin\u2019 RNA (hpRNA) to efficiently silence genes. In this study we examine design rules for efficient gene silencing, in terms of both the proportion of independent transgenic plants showing silencing, and the degree of silencing. Using hpRNA constructs containing sense/anti\u2010sense arms ranging from 98 to 853\u2003nt gave efficient silencing in a wide range of plant species, and inclusion of an intron in these constructs had a consistently enhancing effect. Intron\u2010containing constructs (ihpRNA) generally gave 90\u2013100% of independent transgenic plants showing silencing. The degree of silencing with these constructs was much greater than that obtained using either co \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 2145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7891899057516278681", "cites_id": ["7891899057516278681"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2001.01105.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mXN_NmGohW0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 34, "2003": 76, "2004": 96, "2005": 99, "2006": 139, "2007": 169, "2008": 149, "2009": 121, "2010": 152, "2011": 159, "2012": 123, "2013": 131, "2014": 120, "2015": 106, "2016": 77, "2017": 72, "2018": 65, "2019": 62, "2020": 60, "2021": 52, "2022": 42, "2023": 24}}
