To study the regulation of flavonol synthesis in fruit, we isolated and characterized the grapevine (Vitis vinifera \u2018Shiraz\u2019) R2R3-MYB transcription factor VvMYBF1. Transient reporter assays established VvMYBF1 to be a specific activator of flavonol synthase1 (VvFLS1) and several other promoters of grapevine and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes involved in flavonol synthesis. Expression of VvMYBF1 in the Arabidopsis mutant myb12 resulted in complementation of its flavonol-deficient phenotype and confirmed the function of VvMYBF1 as a transcriptional regulator of flavonol synthesis. Transcript analysis of VvMYBF1 throughout grape berry development revealed its expression during flowering and in skins of ripening berries \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 434, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8102827474326292031", "cites_id": ["8102827474326292031"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/151/3/1513/6108576", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P4Z-Q6gGc3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 15, "2011": 14, "2012": 22, "2013": 39, "2014": 40, "2015": 27, "2016": 32, "2017": 41, "2018": 32, "2019": 31, "2020": 36, "2021": 46, "2022": 38, "2023": 20}}
