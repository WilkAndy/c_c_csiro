It is now possible to isolate and sequence the basic genetic material (DNA) from any organism and techniques have been developed to copy and \u2018cut and paste\u2019 DNA molecules to produce new combinations. This has led to the development of genetically modified (GM) plants by the targeted introduction of a small number of well\u2010defined genes directly into the cells of an existing plant variety to improve its quality or performance. Early efforts concentrated on major field crops, such as corn, soybeans and canola. Products from these plants, such as oil and flour, are components of many processed foods, so the rapid adoption of GM commodity crops in the United States has led to widespread appearance of GM plant material in foods. The initial traits targeted, such as herbicide tolerance and pest resistance, provide improved production efficiency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10356110604193273464", "cites_id": ["10356110604193273464"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6047.2000.00184.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eJaYublLuI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
