In the dark, glycerate uptake was slow but it was increased more than five-fold by illumination of the chloroplasts. The stimulatory effect of light was reversed by uncoupling agents. By chromatography of chloroplast extracts it was demonstrated that the concentration of glycerate in the chloroplast stroma exceeded that in the surrounding medium. Glycerate uptake was dependent on temperature and pH and showed saturation kinetics. A number of weak acids inhibited glycerate uptake. It is concluded that glycerate uptake in chloroplasts is mediated by a carrier which is stimulated by illumination of the chloroplasts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9669388946646515537", "cites_id": ["9669388946646515537"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006291X82918149", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UT_0LwSSMIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
