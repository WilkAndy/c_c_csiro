The rate of CO2 fixation by preparations of intact chloroplasts was not significantly increased by the addition of IAA (0.2 - 5 \u00b5M). Electron transport and coupled phosphorylations were similarly unaffected when measured with ferricyanide or methyl viologen as the electron acceptor. Cyclic phosphorylntion mediated by phenazine methosulfate was also not increased by IAA. It is concluded that the hormone does not affect photosynthesis by isolated chloroplasts in short-term experiments and that the increased CO2 uptake observed with leaves following application of IAA may result from some effect of the hormone other than a direct interaction with the chloroplasts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4018594389661360437", "cites_id": ["4018594389661360437"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/pp9780425", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NaEkVE7qxDcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 3, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
