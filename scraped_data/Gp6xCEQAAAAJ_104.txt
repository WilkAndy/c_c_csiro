In the dark, CO2 fixation was only 1 to 2% of that in the light and the products were mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction suggesting fixation by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Label appeared rapidly in the chloroplast fraction following illumination but the amount leveled off after 4 to 5 minutes reflecting the buildup of intermediates to steady state levels. There was only a slight lag before label appeared in the cytoplasmic fraction and it continued to increase at a constant rate reflecting synthesis of neutral products. In the light, the percentage of label in the chloroplast fraction decreased rapidly in the first minute of illumination and was only 10 to 20% in the steady-state. It is suggested that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=506435292230241650", "cites_id": ["506435292230241650"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/65/5/902/6077097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cs0aDzc4BwcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 2, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2}}
