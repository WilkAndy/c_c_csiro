AMP inhibited oxygen evolution to a greater extent than ADP while no inhibition was observed with ATP. Oxygen evolution with ADP or AMP was more sensitive to phosphate inhibition than in the absence of added adenine nucleotides. Photosynthetic intermediates (ribose 5-phosphate or 3-phosphoglycerate) partially relieved the inhibition by ADP. Pyrophosphate also inhibited oxygen evolution, yet, with PP1 plus ADP, oxygen evolution was stimulated. Inhibition of the phosphate transporter using p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid did not reverse ADP inhibition but the subsequent reversal of ADP inhibition by PP1 was prevented. Pyrophosphate relieved inhibition of oxygen evolution by Pi both in the presence and in the absence of added adenine nucleotides.
