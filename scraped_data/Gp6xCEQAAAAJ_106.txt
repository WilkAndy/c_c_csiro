This work aimed to understand how genetic manipulation of the hydroxylation of flavonoids affected grape flavonoid composition and wine properties.We produced transgenic grapevines with decreased expression of flavonoid 3\u2032\u2010hydroxylase (F3\u2032H) and flavonoid 3\u20325\u2032\u2010hydroxylase (F3\u20325\u2032H) to investigate how this altered the composition of flavonoids in grapes and wine. Grapes from transgenic grapevines with decreased expression of F3\u20325\u2032H genes had a concentration of anthocyanin and skin tannin similar to that of Shiraz Controls but had increased seed tannin and a greatly decreased proportion of trihydroxylated anthocyanin and tannin. Lines with decreased expression of F3\u2032H had a decreased concentration of seed tannin and an increased proportion of trihydroxylated flavonoids.
