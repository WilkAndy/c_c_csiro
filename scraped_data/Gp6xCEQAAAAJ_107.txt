Muscat of Alexandria), Sultana and Flame Seedless vines were sampled at intervals from three weeks after flowering to fruit ripeness. The glycosidically\u2010bound constituents present in the samples were quantified through a determination of the glycosyl glucose. At the stage of berry ripeness, the concentration of glycosides per gram fresh weight in the leaf blades was 10\u201330 times higher than in the fruit. During berry development glycoside concentrations increased in leaf blades and petioles but decreased in fruit. However, when expressed on a per berry basis, the levels of glycosides in the fruit increased as ripening progressed; the levels in ripe fruit were high in Muscat Gordo Blanco and low in Sultana. Further experimentation will be needed to establish whether the glycosides are synthesised in the leaves and transported to the berries or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=877111940916862779", "cites_id": ["877111940916862779"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.1996.tb00095.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O1-awqkgLAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
