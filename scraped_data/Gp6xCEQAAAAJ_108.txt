The effect of digitonin was dependent on the digitonin to chlorophyll ratio and on temperature and time. The initial stimulation of oxygen evolution appeared to be a result of uncoupling as digitonin did not stimulate oxygen evolution by uncoupled chloroplasts. The stimulatory effect occurred more rapidly at high digitonin to chlorophyll ratios but the extent of stimulation was low and inhibition occurred soon after addition of the detergent. The inhibition of electron flow by digitonin was due to a site of action near photosystem II which resembled the inhibition reported for tris buffer and resulted in photobleaching. However, digitonin inhibition could not be recovered by washing with reducing agents and was only partially recovered by the addition of artificial electron donors to photosystem II.
