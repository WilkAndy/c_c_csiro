The iso lated proteins or polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention are useful for modifying the pasture quality of legumes, and, in particular, for producing bloat safe forage crops, or crops having enhanced nutritional value, enhanced disease resistance or pest resistance. In addition, these isolated proteins or polypeptides and nucleic acid mol ecules are useful in enhancing dietary PAS in fruits and plant products such as wine, fruit juices and teas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=556797698742547068", "cites_id": ["556797698742547068"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120208198A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fPJNlY4kugcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
