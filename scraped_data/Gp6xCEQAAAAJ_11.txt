In addition to producing several compounds involved in the protection of the berry and the dissemination of the seeds, final products of this pathway also play a critical role in berry and wine quality. In this article, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of VvMYB5b, a cDNA isolated from a grape berry (V. vinifera \u2018Cabernet Sauvignon\u2019) library. VvMYB5b encodes a protein belonging to the R2R3-MYB family of transcription factors and displays significant similarity with VvMYB5a, another MYB factor recently shown to regulate flavonoid synthesis in grapevine. The ability of VvMYB5a and VvMYB5b to activate the grapevine promoters of several structural genes of the flavonoid pathway was confirmed by transient \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 433, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1813204102554763393", "cites_id": ["1813204102554763393"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/147/4/2041/6107699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gcAORobLKRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 19, "2010": 36, "2011": 20, "2012": 27, "2013": 37, "2014": 32, "2015": 35, "2016": 29, "2017": 21, "2018": 23, "2019": 36, "2020": 32, "2021": 29, "2022": 36, "2023": 17}}
