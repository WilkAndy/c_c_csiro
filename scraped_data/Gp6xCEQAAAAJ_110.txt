Methods for isolating leaf protoplasts vary widely, possibly reflecting the diversity of tissues that have been utilized. Because the cell walls have been removed, much gentler procedures can be employed to rupture protoplasts, reducing the damage to subcellular organelles and this is one of their greatest advantages. Protoplasts can be prepared by a two-step procedure, in which the tissue is first digested with pectinase to yield isolated cells and the cell walls are then removed by a second digestion with cellulase to yield protoplasts. The protoplasts should be examined with a light microscope to ensure that the preparation is free \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1468868426392956835", "cites_id": ["1468868426392956835"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0076687987480208", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o2_wKA14YhQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
