These transporters almost certainly play an important role in the regulation of photosynthesis and of cytoplasmic metabolism. The phosphate transporter facilitates counter-exchange of inorganic phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate across the envelope membranes [1, 2]. The dicarboxylate transporter is specific for dicarboxylic acids and is thought to be involved in transfer of reducing equivalents between chloroplast and cytoplasm [1, 2]. The adenine nucleotide transporter exchanges ATP and ADP across the envelope membranes although the rates of transfer are low compared to the other two transporters [1, 3]. The use of specific inhibitors of these transporters would provide further information about the transporters themselves and about \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11119702427294183774", "cites_id": ["11119702427294183774"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014579377803062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XjHrYnEeUZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 1, "1978": 1, "1979": 0, "1980": 2, "1981": 0, "1982": 2, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1}}
