Many of the ANRsi (silenced) transgenic lines had an altered appearance and a low concentration of leaf tannin but produced no fruit. Those that did produce fruit had a higher concentration of flavonol and a lower concentration of tannin in the skin but no change in seed or overall berry tannin. The ANRsi wines had a higher concentration of anthocyanin, flavonol, tannin and phenolic substances and higher colour. The LARsi lines had a lower concentration of tannin in the leaves and seeds but not in berry skins and produced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6485782182921759546", "cites_id": ["6485782182921759546"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajgw.12468", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OuubP4ggAloJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
