To study the involvement of invertase in grape berry ripening, we have cloned two cDNAs (GIN1 and GIN2) from berries. The cDNAs encode translation products that are 62% identical to each other and both appear to be vacuolar forms of invertase. Both genes are expressed in a variety of tissues, including berries, leaves, roots, seeds, and flowers, but the two genes have distinct patterns of expression. In grape berries, hexose accumulation began 8 weeks postflowering and continued until the fruit was ripe at 16 weeks. Invertase activity increased from flowering, was maximal 8 weeks postflowering, and remained constant on a per berry basis throughout ripening. Expression of GIN1 and GIN2 in berries, which was high early in berry development, declined greatly at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C", "num_citations": 424, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17518679020096553236", "cites_id": ["17518679020096553236"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/111/1/275/6070228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FIHxNsDZHvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 9, "1998": 7, "1999": 10, "2000": 12, "2001": 15, "2002": 15, "2003": 10, "2004": 11, "2005": 10, "2006": 22, "2007": 10, "2008": 18, "2009": 20, "2010": 22, "2011": 20, "2012": 16, "2013": 26, "2014": 26, "2015": 18, "2016": 18, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 22, "2020": 18, "2021": 17, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
