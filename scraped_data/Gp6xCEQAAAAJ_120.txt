When barley (Hordeum vulgare, L. cv. Clipper) leaf slices were incubated in sorbitol there was considerable uptake of sorbitol into the tissue, which continued for up to 6 h and was dependent on the sorbitol concentration in the external medium. Protoplasts prepared by digesting leaf slices in a medium containing [14C]sorbitol but isolated and purified in media with unlabelled sorbitol contained significant amounts of [14C]sorbitol. From measurements of the protoplast volume, the internal sorbitol concentration was calculated to be 100 mM, assuming uniform distribution of the sorbitol throughout the protoplasm. The uptake of sorbitol during digestion and its retention by protoplasts was confirmed by measuring sugars in protoplast extracts by gas sucrose or inositol.
