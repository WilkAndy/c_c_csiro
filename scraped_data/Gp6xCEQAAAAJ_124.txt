Ripening occurs during the second growth phase when grapes change colour, start to soften, accumulate reducing sugars, metabolise organic acids and synthesise flavour compounds. Unlike many other fruit, grapes ripen while the berries are still expanding, and as with most non-climacteric fruit, ripening does not appear to be controlled by ethylene. Sugars and amino acids that accumulate in grapes during ripening are imported via the phloem, while many secondary metabolites are synthesised within the berry itself. Grapes import sucrose but accumulate hexoses. Conversion of sucrose to hexoses is most likely catalysed by invertase. cDNAs encoding vacuolar invertases have been isolated from grape berries. Expression of these genes and an increase in invertase activity occur before veraison, so it seems unlikely that synthesis of this enzyme is a controlling factor for sugar accumulation during ripening. Proteins that transport sugars into the berry vacuole may regulate sugar accumulation, and cDNAs encoding both sucrose and hexose transporters have been isolated from ripening grape berries. Determination of the role of these transporters may reveal the pathway of sugar accumulation in grapes. Anthocyanins are only synthesised in the skin of red grapes after veraison. Analysis of the patterns of expression of genes in the flavonoid pathway has shown that there is a dramatic increase in expression of many of these genes in skin cells at veraison. Expression of the gene encoding a glycosyl transferase involved in the lasts steps of anthocyanin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8966222856255050622", "cites_id": ["8966222856255050622"], "pub_url": "https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=211329", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fhMSxC5sbnwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
