The rate of uptake of orthophosphate (Pi) from the suspending medium with sunflower chloroplasts was less than 20% of that in spinach chloroplasts. The apparent Km for Pi transport was lower in sunflower chloroplasts but uptake was competitively inhibited by 3-phosphoglycerate in chloroplasts from both species. Uptake of malate (via the dicarboxylate transporter) and of ATP (via the adenine nucleotide transporter) was also reduced in sunflower chloroplasts compared to spinach chloroplasts. The endogenous Pi content and total exchangeable phosphate pool of sunflower chloroplasts were less than half that in spinach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6097559242308821476", "cites_id": ["6097559242308821476"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00034123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5KG3GtPhnlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2}}
