Hydroxylation of the B-ring of flavonoids is catalyzed by flavonoid 3\u2032-hydroxylase (F3\u2032H) and flavonoid 3\u2032,5\u2032-hydroxylase (F3\u20325\u2032H), and may also require cytochrome b5. We report the identification of genes encoding F3\u2032H, F3\u20325\u2032H, and a putative cytochrome b5 from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv Shiraz) and their transcriptional regulation in fruit. Functionality of the genes VvF3\u2032H and VvF3\u20325\u2032H1 was demonstrated by ectopic expression in petunia (Petunia hybrida), which altered flower color and flavonoid composition as expected. VvF3\u2032H was expressed in grapes before flowering, when 3\u2032-hydroxylated flavonols are made, and all three genes were expressed after flowering, when proanthocyanidins (PAs) are synthesized.
