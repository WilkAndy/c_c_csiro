Hypothesis: the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit results in inflammatory responses that mitigate against successful weaning.Design:Single-center prospective observational feasibility study.Setting:PICU.Patients:Twenty-four neonates requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn.Interventions:None.Measurements and Main Results:The reference outcome was death or more than 7 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Other outcomes included serial measures of plasma-free hemoglobin and markers of its metabolism, leucocyte, platelet and endothelial activation, and biomarkers of inflammation.
