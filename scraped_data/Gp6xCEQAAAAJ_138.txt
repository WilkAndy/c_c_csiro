CTs occur in a wide range of plants where play important role in defence against herbivores and pathogens and have important industrial applications. As food components, they act as antioxidants with beneficial effects for human and animal health (Dixon et al. 2005). In animal feeding they exert a positive or negative effect depending on the amount: large amounts (> 10mg/g of DM) confer a bitter taste to forages and prevent the free intake by the animals, conversely moderate amounts (2-5 mg/g of DM) in legume forages increase protein assimilation by the animal. For their capacity of interact with proteins CTs in fact prevent bloating in ruminants (Tanner, 2004). The major forage legumes accumulate these products in seed coat and not in leaves. The goal of the research in this field is thus to engineer CT biosynthesis in leaves of forage legumes to produce bloat-safe varieties. Investigating and manipulating the regulatory apparatus seems therefore a promising strategy. In Arabidopsis the MYB, bHLH and WD40 (MBW) complex controls CT and anthocyanin pigmentation as well as the development of trichomes and root hairs. Within this complex, the WD component is common to all the different functional complexes, while the bHLH and MYB proteins are flexible and the specifity in regulating the different pathways in different tissues is conferred by different MYBs (Zhang et al. 2003). In forage legumes, the ectopic expression of bHLH and/or WD genes did not result in de novo synthesis of CT in vegetative tissues (Paolocci et al. 2007).
