Plants were harvested 3 weeks after starting NaCl treatment. Fresh and dry weight of both shoots and roots was decreased more than 50% compared to control plants but the salt-stressed plants appeared healthy and were still actively growing. The salt-stressed plants had much thicker leaves. The salt-treated plants osmotically adjusted to maintain leaf turgor. Leaf K+ was decreased but Na+ and Cl\u2212 were greatly increased.The potential photosynthetic capacity of the leaves was measured at saturating CO2 to overcome any stomatal limitation. Photosynthesis of salt-stressed plants varied only by about 10% from the controls when expressed on a leaf area or chlorophyll basis.
