The fruit of'Goldfinger'(FHIA-01) is reported to be more resistant to browning than other commercial banana varieties such as Williams. PPO activity was measured in a range of tissues from'Goldfinger'and'Williams' and the highest activity was found in flowers and immature fruit of both cultivars. The PPO activity in'Goldfinger'was approximately half of that in equivalent tissues of'Williams'. Four cDNAs encoding PPO have previously been isolated from'Williams' fruit. Expression of these genes was measured in'Goldfinger'tissues and the pattern was similar to that previously observed in'Williams'. Expression of one gene (BPO1) was detected in the leaf roll, flowers and immature fruit, all of which had high PPO activity. As with'Williams', expression of the other three PPO genes was not detected. Genomic DNA was extracted from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.musalit.org/seeMore.php?id=6353", "cites_per_year": {}}
