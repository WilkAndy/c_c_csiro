This was manifested as a retardation of the increases in berry weight, color, deformability, and hexose concentration. BTOA treatment also delayed by 2 weeks the increase in abscisic acid level that normally accompanies ripening and altered the expression of a number of developmentally regulated genes. A putative vacuolar invertase, which is normally expressed from berry set until ripening and turned off after ripening commences, remained expressed throughout development in BTOA-treated grape berries. This elevated expression resulted in increased levels of invertase activity. In contrast, the up-regulation of four other genes normally switched on at the time of ripening was delayed in BTOA-treated fruit.
