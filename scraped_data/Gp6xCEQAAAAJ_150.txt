This may be achieved spontaneously in vitro by preincubation of the enzyme with high CO2 and Mg2+ at alkaline pH. However the normal in vivo conditions of low CO2 and the presence of RuBP do not permit the formation of fully active enzyme without an additional protein factor called rubisco activase (2,3). This was first shown clearly by the phenotype of the rca mutant of Arabidopsis (4). The rubisco in this plant can be fully activated by high CO2 in the dark (5) or after the isolation of the enzyme (4). However in vivo after several minutes under saturating light, the activity of the enzyme is very low even at high CO2 concentrations. The rca mutant lacks two nearly identical polypeptides of about 45 and 41 kD (2,6).
