The results also suggest that CO2 diffusion can limit photosynthetic capacity in previously water-stressed or ABA-treated leaves, even at high levels of CO2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU8901772", "cites_per_year": {}}
