Much of the early work was with algae grown under short periods of Mn-deficiency and then rapidly recovered upon addition of exogenous Mn. Ultrastructural examination of Mn-deficient algae revealed no effect on thylakoid organisation (Cheniae, Martin 1968), unless cells were grown under such conditions for prolonged periods (Kessler 1970). Reports of thylakoid disintegration in higher plant chloroplasts vary according to species and perhaps severity of the symptoms (Possingham et al 1964, Homann 1967, Anderson, Pyliotis 1969). These observations have led to the suggestion that Mn, in addition to its primary role as an electron transport component, also has a structural role. This paper examines the thylakoids of Mn-deficient leaves in relation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-4973-2_46", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SFEEw4sVVHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
