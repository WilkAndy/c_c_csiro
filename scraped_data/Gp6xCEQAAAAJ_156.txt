For this carbon to re-renter the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, the glycerate is phosphorylated to form 3-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme glycerate kinase, which is located in the chloroplast stroma (Usuda, Edwards 1980). Thus there needs to be a controlled movement of glycerate into the chloroplast during photorespiration. Previous studies have indicated that there is a specific transporter on the chloroplast envelope to facilitate movement of glycerate into the chloroplast (Robinson 1982). In contrast to other chloroplast transporters glycerate uptake is markedly increased by illumination of the chloroplast suspension. Glycerate has a pKa of 3.55 so at neutral pH more than 99% exists as the glycerate anion. It seems likely that uptake of the glycerate anion would \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-6368-4_102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tugIXSgxxAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
