Therefore, if Mg2+ and increased pH are the major factors in light activation, it seems improbable that the lags in CO2 fixation normally observed (1) and the very long lags that may be observed in the presence of high"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1161941453978608441&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OSMynpgLIBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
