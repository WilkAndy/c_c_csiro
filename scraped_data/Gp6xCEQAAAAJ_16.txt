The predominant flavonols were quercetin\u20103\u2010glycosides with trace amounts of kaempferol\u20103\u2010glycosides detected in Shiraz flowers but not in developing berries. Flavonols were present in the skin of ripening grapes but were not detected in seeds or flesh. Flavonols were also present in buds, tendrils, inflorescences, anthers and leaves. The concentration of flavonols in flowers (mg/g fresh weight) was high and decreased between flowering and berry set then remained relatively constant through berry development. The total amount of flavonols in berries (mg/berry) was low until pre\u2010veraison then increased during berry development, particularly before veraison, the onset of ripening, in Chardonnay and during ripening in Shiraz.
