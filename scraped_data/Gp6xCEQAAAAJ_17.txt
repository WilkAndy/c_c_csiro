Some leakage of glycinebetaine from the chloroplasts occurred during the isolation so the concentration in chloroplasts in vivo could be up to 1.5 times higher than that measured in isolated chloroplasts. It was demonstrated that any contamination of the chloroplast preparations by glycinebetaine originating from other cellular compartments or from broken chloroplasts would have amounted to less than 10% of the measured values.   Leaf osmotic potential of salt-stressed plants was -2.09 MPa compared to -0.91 MPa in non-stressed controls. This was accompanied by a sixfold increase in glycinebetaine content in the leaf but the levels of choline and proline were not increased. In chloroplasts isolated from control leaves the calculated glycinebetaine concentration was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 333, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=842819332068445489", "cites_id": ["842819332068445489"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/PP9860659", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MY3FkbdLsgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 12, "1989": 10, "1990": 4, "1991": 4, "1992": 5, "1993": 7, "1994": 6, "1995": 9, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 10, "1999": 6, "2000": 13, "2001": 8, "2002": 16, "2003": 7, "2004": 16, "2005": 7, "2006": 11, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 10, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 13, "2013": 9, "2014": 17, "2015": 9, "2016": 15, "2017": 10, "2018": 13, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
