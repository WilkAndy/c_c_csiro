Fluorescence and light microscopy of intact berries revealed no measurable change in cell wall thickness as the mesocarp cells expanded in the ripening fruit. Isolated walls were analyzed for their protein contents and amino acid compositions, and for changes in the composition and solubility of constituent polysaccharides during development. Increases in protein content after veraison were accompanied by an approximate 3-fold increase in hydroxyproline content. The type I arabinogalactan content of the pectic polysaccharides decreased from approximately 20 mol % of total wall polysaccharides to about 4 mol % of wall polysaccharides during berry development. Galacturonan content increased from 26 to 41 mol % of wall polysaccharides, and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 326, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4094526906886694132", "cites_id": ["4094526906886694132"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/118/3/783/6085738", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9KRCMIeu0jgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 13, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 15, "2005": 9, "2006": 14, "2007": 10, "2008": 18, "2009": 14, "2010": 16, "2011": 10, "2012": 19, "2013": 17, "2014": 19, "2015": 15, "2016": 15, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 14, "2020": 21, "2021": 20, "2022": 17, "2023": 6}}
