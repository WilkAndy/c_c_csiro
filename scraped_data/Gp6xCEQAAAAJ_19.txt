Prior to flowering, bunches of Shiraz grapes were enclosed in boxes designed to eliminate light without altering bunch temperature and humidity. This artificial bunch shading had little effect on berry ripening and accumulation of sugar but at harvest the shaded bunches had smaller berries and higher seed weight, juice pH and titratable acidity. The amount of anthocyanins in the fruit was not changed significantly but anthocyanin composition in the shaded berries was shifted towards dioxygenated anthocyanins (the glucosides of cyanidin and peonidin derivatives). Shaded fruit had increased seed tannins and decreased skin tannins but the largest relative change in flavonoids was a marked \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 298, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4570364697958353450", "cites_id": ["4570364697958353450"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2007.tb00235.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KgrLW3oybT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 7, "2009": 10, "2010": 16, "2011": 21, "2012": 27, "2013": 25, "2014": 24, "2015": 29, "2016": 22, "2017": 21, "2018": 16, "2019": 20, "2020": 17, "2021": 19, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
