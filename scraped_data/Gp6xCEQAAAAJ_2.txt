In apples (Malus domestica Borkh.), several steps of the anthocyanin pathway are coordinately regulated, suggesting control by common transcription factors. A gene encoding an R2R3 MYB transcription factor was isolated from apple (cv Cripps' Pink) and designated MdMYB1. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence suggests that this gene encodes an ortholog of anthocyanin regulators in other plants. The expression of MdMYB1 in both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants and cultured grape cells induced the ectopic synthesis of anthocyanin. In the grape (Vitis vinifera) cells MdMYB1 stimulated transcription from the promoters of two apple genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes. In ripening apple fruit the transcription of MdMYB1 was correlated with anthocyanin synthesis in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 968, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2885605152498487330", "cites_id": ["2885605152498487330"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/142/3/1216/6106456", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IpC1_Ji6CygJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 12, "2008": 17, "2009": 32, "2010": 35, "2011": 39, "2012": 49, "2013": 54, "2014": 61, "2015": 59, "2016": 68, "2017": 68, "2018": 82, "2019": 98, "2020": 67, "2021": 90, "2022": 85, "2023": 51}}
