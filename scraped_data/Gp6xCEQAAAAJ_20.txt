A rapid increase in the mRNA levels of a number of cDNAs not present in unripe fruit occurred in grape berries at the onset of ripening. The putative translation products of some of these clones had homologs in other species that are involved in cell wall structure. These included four proline-rich proteins, a small protein that is similar to the non-catalytic, N-terminal domain of some pectin methylesterases, and two other glutamate-rich proteins. The remainder of the clones encoded putative stress response proteins. These included two thaumatin-like proteins, a metallothionein, a transcription factor, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, and proteins induced by water, sugar, and/or cold stress in other species. Many of the homologs of the grape cDNAs thought to be involved in cell wall structure or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC", "num_citations": 284, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14161360167130035409", "cites_id": ["14161360167130035409"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/122/3/803/6081170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0fQmugpCh8QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 11, "2002": 21, "2003": 15, "2004": 20, "2005": 12, "2006": 25, "2007": 19, "2008": 21, "2009": 10, "2010": 13, "2011": 22, "2012": 13, "2013": 12, "2014": 13, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 12, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
