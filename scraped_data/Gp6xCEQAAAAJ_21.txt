Photosynthesis became light saturated at 1100 to 1400 micromoles per square meter per second in salt-treated plants and at approximately 2000 micromoles per square meter per second in control plants. Photosynthetic capacity of the mesophyll measured as a function of intercellular partial pressure of CO2 at the light intensity prevailing during growth and at light saturation were both decreased in the salttreated plants. The CO2 compensation points and relative enhancements of photosynthesis at low O2 were not affected by salinity. The lower photosynthetic rates in salt-treated leaves at 450 micromoles per square meter per second were associated with a 70% reduction in stomatal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:mKu_rENv82IC", "num_citations": 282, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15528904042650692240", "cites_id": ["15528904042650692240"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/78/1/85/6080227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kGpSffO_gdcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 5, "1987": 6, "1988": 8, "1989": 11, "1990": 15, "1991": 5, "1992": 6, "1993": 5, "1994": 7, "1995": 7, "1996": 6, "1997": 5, "1998": 7, "1999": 5, "2000": 12, "2001": 8, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 11, "2008": 10, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 12, "2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
