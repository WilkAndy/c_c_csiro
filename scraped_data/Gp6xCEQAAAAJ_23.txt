In contrast, \u03b2-1,3-glucanase activity was not detected in grape berries at any stage of development. Two closely related chitinase cDNAs (VvChi4A and VvChi4B) were cloned from grapes. Sequence and Southern analysis indicate that these two clones may represent alleles of the same gene. The predicted proteins are acidic and have a signal peptide followed by a cysteine-rich, chitin-binding domain and a catalytic region. An analysis of their sequences indicates that they are class IV chitinases. The deduced protein sequence of VvChi4A has a high level of identity with the 32- and 28-kD chitinases present as haze proteins in wine. Expression of VvChi4 was high in berries and low in flowers but was not detected in leaves \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 268, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2244484210078772850", "cites_id": ["2244484210078772850"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/114/3/771/6071134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cu63TX8CJh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 8, "1999": 6, "2000": 15, "2001": 11, "2002": 9, "2003": 12, "2004": 11, "2005": 14, "2006": 7, "2007": 11, "2008": 17, "2009": 12, "2010": 24, "2011": 15, "2012": 9, "2013": 7, "2014": 14, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
