The assay conditions sufficient for this activity were 0.4 molar sorbitol, 50 millimolar N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N\u2032-2-ethanesulfonic acid KOH (pH 7.6), and 10 millimolar NaHCO3 with protoplast, plus a requirement of 1 to 10 millimolar ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and 0.2 to 0.5 millimolar inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) with protoplast extracts and chloroplasts. Protoplast extracts evolved approximately 6 micromoles of O2 per milligram of chlorophyll before photosynthesis became largely dependent on exogenous Pi while photosynthesis by chloroplasts had a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 235, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10761970043091120351", "cites_id": ["10761970043091120351"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/62/2/313/6075426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:33DXHbwyWpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 16, "1982": 17, "1983": 21, "1984": 23, "1985": 20, "1986": 15, "1987": 17, "1988": 8, "1989": 8, "1990": 9, "1991": 6, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 6, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
