Here, the activities of enzymes that might participate in cell wall modification have been monitored throughout berry development. \u03b1-Galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22), \u03b2-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) and pectin methylesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) activities were present, but no polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15), cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4), xyloglucanase (xyloglucan-specific cellulase EC 3.2.1.4) or galactanase (EC 3.2.1.89) could be detected. The accumulation of mRNAs encoding wall-modifying enzymes was examined by northern hybridization analysis. Transcripts for \u03b2-galactosidase, pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2) and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (EC 2.4.1.207) were present \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3595306294184682392", "cites_id": ["3595306294184682392"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004250100609", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mKOamwYY5TEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 10, "2005": 12, "2006": 12, "2007": 14, "2008": 18, "2009": 10, "2010": 15, "2011": 15, "2012": 19, "2013": 13, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 8}}
