Ripening occurs during the second growth phase when grapes change colour, start to soften, accumulate reducing sugars, metabolise organic acids and synthesise flavour compounds. Unlike many other fruit, grapes ripen while the berries are still expanding, and as with most non\u2010climacteric fruit, ripening does not appear to be controlled by ethylene.Sugars and amino acids that accumulate in grapes during ripening are imported via the phloem, while many secondary metabolites are synthesised within the berry itself. Grapes import sucrose but accumulate hexoses. Conversion of sucrose to hexoses is most likely catalysed by invertase. cDNAs encoding vacuolar invertases have been isolated from grape berries. Expression of these genes and an increase in invertase activity occur before veraison, so it seems unlikely that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12445877101557550494", "cites_id": ["12445877101557550494"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2000.tb00177.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:no2BZEijuKwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 10, "2008": 9, "2009": 5, "2010": 18, "2011": 15, "2012": 19, "2013": 17, "2014": 12, "2015": 14, "2016": 20, "2017": 10, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
