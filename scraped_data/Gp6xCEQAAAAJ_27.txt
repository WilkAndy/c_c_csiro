PPO activity was higher in early developmental stages of both leaves and endosperm of fruits. Wounding or exposure of coffee leaves to methyl jasmonate increased PPO activity 1.5\u20134-fold. PPO was not latent and was not activated by protease treatment. PPO activity was stimulated 10\u201315% with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) at 0.35\u20131.75 mM, but at higher concentrations activities were similar to the control samples, without detergent. Prolonged incubation of extracts with trypsin or proteinase K inhibited PPO activity but pepsin had no effect. Inhibition of PPO with proteinase K was increased in the presence of SDS. PPO activity from both tissues was optimal at pH 6\u20137 and at an assay temperature of 30\u00b0C. Activity was highest with chlorogenic acid as substrate with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 205, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12234939569057334550", "cites_id": ["12234939569057334550"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942200003320", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FoUI7rY8y6kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 9, "2003": 7, "2004": 9, "2005": 10, "2006": 13, "2007": 18, "2008": 7, "2009": 11, "2010": 9, "2011": 10, "2012": 7, "2013": 17, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 12, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
