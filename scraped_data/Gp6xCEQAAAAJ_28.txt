Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz grapes contained anthocyanin monoglucosides as well as acetylated and coumarylated derivatives, predominantly of malvidin, whereas Pinot Noir grapes contained only anthocyanin monoglucosides. Fruit of some sports arising from varieties with black berries either lacked anthocyanins or had much lower levels than their progenitors. A bud sport of Cabernet Sauvignon (Bronze Cabernet) exhibited a 90% reduction in anthocyanin levels, but an anthocyanin composition similar to that of the normal Cabernet Sauvignon fruit. The fruit of a white\u2010coloured bud sport of Bronze Cabernet did not contain anthocyanins. Coloured berries of sports originating on varieties with white\u2010skinned berries also had lower levels of anthocyanins than black grapes, but like Pinot Noir contained very low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 196, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12697062850028923092", "cites_id": ["12697062850028923092"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.1996.tb00104.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1GjI4mMHNbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 10, "2007": 5, "2008": 9, "2009": 5, "2010": 12, "2011": 6, "2012": 12, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 13, "2018": 13, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
