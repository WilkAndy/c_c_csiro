In this report, we show that the bronze-coloured berries of the Malian cultivar, a documented bud sport of the wine grape Cabernet Sauvignon (Vitis vinifera L.), lack anthocyanins in the subepidermal cells compared to the red/black berried Cabernet Sauvignon in which both the epidermis and several subepidermal cell layers contain anthocyanin. The Malian phenotype is correlated with an alteration in the genome indicated by a reduction of hybridisation signal using a MYBA probe. In Shalistin, a white-berried bud sport of Malian, the red allele at the berry colour locus appears to have been deleted completely. These data suggest that Malian could be a L1/L2 periclinal chimera, which gave rise to Shalistin by an invasion of epidermal cells (L1) by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7745149474424693868", "cites_id": ["7745149474424693868"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11103-006-9043-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bCRjU2lMfGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 13, "2010": 15, "2011": 12, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 15, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 15, "2018": 11, "2019": 18, "2020": 12, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
