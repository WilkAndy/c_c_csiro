Expression of seven genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (phenylalanine ammonia lyase [PAL], chalcone synthase [CHS], chalcone isomerase [CHI], flavanone-3-hydroxylase [F3H], dihydroflavonol 4-reductase [DFR], leucoanthocyanidin dioxygen-ase [LDOX], and UDP glucose-flavonoid 3-o-glucosyl transferase [UFGT]) was determined. In flowers and grape berry skins, expression of all of the genes, except UFGT, was detected up to 4 weeks postflowering, followed by a reduction in this expression 6 to 8 weeks postflowering. Expression of CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, LDOX, and UFGT then increased 10 weeks postflowering, coinciding with the onset of anthocyanin synthesis. In grape berry flesh, no PAL or UFGT expression was detected at any stage of development \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 857, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5050712819184559597", "cites_id": ["5050712819184559597"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/111/4/1059/6070342", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7eUBmoy8F0YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 8, "1999": 8, "2000": 9, "2001": 21, "2002": 16, "2003": 17, "2004": 25, "2005": 19, "2006": 35, "2007": 29, "2008": 36, "2009": 43, "2010": 49, "2011": 56, "2012": 54, "2013": 63, "2014": 33, "2015": 46, "2016": 43, "2017": 37, "2018": 36, "2019": 44, "2020": 42, "2021": 30, "2022": 25, "2023": 25}}
