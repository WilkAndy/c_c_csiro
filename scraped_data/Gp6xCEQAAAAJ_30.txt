The increase in hydrolytic activity was directly related to the severity of powdery mildew infection on both leaves and berries but no systemic induction was observed in uninfected tissues. A number of cDNA clones encoding various PR proteins, including chitinases (PR-2), \u03b2-1, 3-glucanases (PR-3) and thaumatin-like (TL) proteins (PR-5), were isolated and their expression in response to powdery mildew infection examined. PR genes encoding extracellular proteins were most strongly induced in infected leaves, including an acidic class III chitinase (VvChi3), a basic class I glucanase (VvGlub) and a thaumatin-like protein (VvTl2). A basic class I chitinase (VvChi1b) was also detected, but only in severely infected leaves. A similar pattern of PR gene induction was observed in mildew-infected preveraison berries, with the exception of VvChi1b, which was not detected. Chitinase and \u03b2-1, 3-glucanase enzyme activities were also found to be highly induced in leaves and preveraison berries by ethephon treatment. The pattern of chitinase gene induction by ethephon, however, was markedly different for mildew infection, with no apparent induction of VvChi3 but a marked increase in the transcript level of an acidic class IV chitinase, VvChi4. These results demonstrated that the leaves and preveraison berries of grapevine respond to environmental and stress-related stimuli by the expression of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11328886801577714611", "cites_id": ["11328886801577714611"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19991004776", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s6Om5IVKOJ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 18, "2009": 11, "2010": 16, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 13, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
