In vitro, activation of rubisco by rubisco activase is dependent on ATP and is inhibited by ADP. Purified rubisco activase hydrolyzed ATP with a specific activity of 1.5 \u03bcmol min\u22121 mg\u22121 protein, releasing approximately stoichiometric amounts of ADP and Pi. Hydrolysis was highly specific for ATP-Mg and had a broad pH optimum, with maximum activity at pH 8.0\u20138.5. ATPase activity was inhibited by ADP but not by molybdate, vanadate, azide, nitrate, or fluoride. Addition of rubisco in either the inactive or activated form had no significant effect on ATPase activity. Incubation of rubisco activase in the absence of ATP resulted in loss of both ATPase and rubisco activation activities. Both activities were also heat labile, with 50% loss in activity after 5 min at 38 \u00b0C and complete inhibition following \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=702831225314581089", "cites_id": ["702831225314581089"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003986189905687", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YZrtkUb1wAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 7, "1991": 3, "1992": 6, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 5, "1996": 8, "1997": 6, "1998": 9, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 9, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 9, "2005": 6, "2006": 10, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
