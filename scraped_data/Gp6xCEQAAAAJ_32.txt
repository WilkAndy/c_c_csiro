Sequence analysis indicated that these deduced proteins are most closely related to plant, plasma membrane located, sucrose-H+ symporters. Northern blot analysis showed that these clones are differentially expressed in different tissues. Expression of VvSUC11 and VvSUC12 was upregulated in berries when hexose accumulation commenced in the vacuole while the expression of VvSUC27 declined during ripening. These results indicate a possible role for sucrose transporters in the ripening-associated accumulation of hexoses in the berry vacuole."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3972549454484307306", "cites_id": ["3972549454484307306"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016894529900059X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:an01b65UITcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 9, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 4, "2006": 12, "2007": 12, "2008": 5, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 12, "2012": 6, "2013": 11, "2014": 15, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 5}}
