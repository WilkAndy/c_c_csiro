The uptake and retention mechanisms of F-18 BMS-747158-02 in cardiac myocytes were studied in vitro, and the biodistribution of F-18 BMS-747158-02 was studied in vivo in mice.Methods and ResultsFluorine 19 BMS-747158-01 inhibited mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) in bovine heart submitochondrial particles with an IC50 of 16.6\u00b13 nmol/L that was comparable to the reference inhibitors of MC-1, rotenone, pyridaben, and deguelin (IC50 of 18.2\u00b16.7 nmol/L, 19.8\u00b12.6 nmol/L, and 23.1\u00b11.5 nmol/L, respectively). F-18 BMS-747158-02 had high uptake in monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (10.3%\u00b10.7% of incubated drug at 60 minutes) that was inhibited by 200 nmol/L of rotenone (91%\u00b12%) and deguelin (89%\u00b13%).
