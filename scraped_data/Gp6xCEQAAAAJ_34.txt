A degenerate oligonucleotide primer based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this purified 40 kDa grape PPO protein was used to amplify a 1650 bp cDNA clone (GPO1M) by 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3\u2032-RACE). GPO1M hybridized to a single 2.2 kb transcript from grape berry mRNA indicating the presence of further upstream sequence which was cloned using 5\u2032-RACE PCR. The complete 1990 bp cDNA (GPO1) encodes a 67 kDa protein consisting of a 10.6 kDa chloroplast transit peptide, a 40.5 kDa catalytic unit containing two copper-binding regions and a 16.2 kDa C-terminal extension. Southern analysis suggested the presence of only one PPO gene in grapevine.
