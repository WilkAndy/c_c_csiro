Williams] fruit. Banana flesh was high in PPO activity throughout growth and ripening. Peel showed high levels of activity early in development but activity declined until ripening started and then remained constant. PPO activity in fruit was not substantially induced after wounding or treatment with 5-methyl jasmonate. Banana flowers and unexpanded leaf roll had high PPO activities with lower activities observed in mature leaves, roots and stem. Four different PPO cDNA clones were amplified from banana fruit (BPO1, BPO11, BPO34 and BPO35). Full-length cDNA and genomic clones were isolated for the most abundant sequence (BPO1) and the genomic clone was found to contain an 85-bp intron. Introns have not been previously found in PPO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4225745765378662198", "cites_id": ["4225745765378662198"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004250100553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Np-BeGLdpDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 11, "2005": 10, "2006": 9, "2007": 12, "2008": 16, "2009": 10, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
