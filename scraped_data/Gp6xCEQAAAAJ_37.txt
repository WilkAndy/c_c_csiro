PPO purified to homogeneity from broad bean (Vicia faba L.) leaves in the presence of protease inhibitors had an apparent molecular mass of 60 kD determined by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under partially denaturing conditions, the protein had an apparent molecular mass of 43 kilodaltons, but this was shifted to 60 kilodaltons in the presence of sulfhydryl reductants, suggesting the presence of disulfide bonding. The purified protein was totally latent; i.e. PPO activity was only detected when assayed with sodium dodecyl sulfate. Treatment with proteases in the presence of 0.1% SDS inhibited enzyme activity, but in the absence of SDS the 60-kilodalton PPO was proteolytically cleaved with no loss of PPO activity. This yielded a 42-kilodalton peptide that had PPO activity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15172644137784665082", "cites_id": ["15172644137784665082"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/99/1/317/6088135", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-mMRiHQPkNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 6, "1995": 11, "1996": 8, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 11, "2000": 4, "2001": 8, "2002": 0, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
