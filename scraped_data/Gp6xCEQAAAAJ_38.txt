We cloned three genes encoding enzymes involved in CT synthesis from cDNA of skin of the red apple variety Malus\u00d7domestica Borkh. cv. \u2018Cripps Red\u2019; two leucoanthocyanidin reductases (MdLARs) and an anthocyanidin reductase (MdANR). We measured steady-state transcript levels of the CT genes and the other structural genes of the flavonoid pathway by Real Time PCR and correlated this with flavonoid accumulation in skin throughout early fruit growth and during ripening. Transcripts of the MdANR gene were abundant in both green and red skin sectors early in development which correlated with accumulation of CTs in these tissues. The MdLAR1 gene transcripts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10993772827804247371", "cites_id": ["10993772827804247371"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945205003869", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SyWdriO6kZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 12, "2011": 8, "2012": 19, "2013": 13, "2014": 10, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
