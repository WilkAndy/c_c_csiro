The involvement of the rubisco activase protein in the regulation of rubisco activity by CA1P was investigated. Addition of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) or 6-phosphogluconate partially reversed CA1P inhibition by displacing the inhibitor from rubisco. Rubisco activase also partially reversed the inhibition but rubisco activase and RuBP together almost completely reversed CA1P inhibition of rubisco. Rubisco activase did not metabolize CA1P. Inhibition of rubisco by car\u2610yarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate was not reversed by rubisco activase in the presence or absence of RuBP. The data suggest that rubisco activase interacts with rubisco to alter the RuBP binding site \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10099118975484445677", "cites_id": ["10099118975484445677"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014579388804733", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7UMoZjNHJ4wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 7, "1990": 16, "1991": 5, "1992": 7, "1993": 6, "1994": 7, "1995": 3, "1996": 7, "1997": 6, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
