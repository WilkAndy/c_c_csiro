A regulatory gene, VvMYBA1, which could activate anthocyanin biosynthesis in a transient assay, was recently shown not to be transcribed in white berries due to the presence of a retrotransposon in the promoter. We have found that the berry colour locus comprises two very similar genes, VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2, located on a single bacterial artificial chromosome. Either gene can regulate colour in the grape berry. The white berry allele of VvMYBA2 is inactivated by two non\u2010conservative mutations, one leads to an amino acid substitution and the other to a frame shift resulting in a smaller protein. Transient assays showed that either mutation removed the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 694, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17790081314485686761", "cites_id": ["17790081314485686761"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02997.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6dE7G7MQ4_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 23, "2009": 27, "2010": 45, "2011": 45, "2012": 24, "2013": 47, "2014": 57, "2015": 46, "2016": 42, "2017": 46, "2018": 42, "2019": 58, "2020": 47, "2021": 53, "2022": 56, "2023": 21}}
