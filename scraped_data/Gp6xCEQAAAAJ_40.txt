They are produced through a multistep pathway that is controlled by MYB transcription factors. VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 activate anthocyanin biosynthesis in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and are nonfunctional in white grapevine cultivars. In this study, transgenic grapevines with altered VvMYBA gene expression were developed, and transcript analysis was carried out on berries using a microarray technique. The results showed that VvMYBA is a positive regulator of the later stages of anthocyanin synthesis, modification, and transport in cv Shiraz. One up-regulated gene, ANTHOCYANIN 3-O-GLUCOSIDE-6\u2033-O-ACYLTRANSFERASE (Vv3AT), encodes a BAHD acyltransferase protein (named after the first letter of the first four characterized proteins: BEAT [for acetyl CoA:benzylalcohol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2319692178224468798", "cites_id": ["2319692178224468798"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/169/3/1897/6114123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PlNS774zMSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 7, "2017": 20, "2018": 15, "2019": 19, "2020": 15, "2021": 23, "2022": 20, "2023": 12}}
