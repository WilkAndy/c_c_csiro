For leaves collected from field\u2010grown vines in spring there was a correlation between resistance rating and activity of chitinase and \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucanase. The correlation was greater with the sum of the two enzyme activities. In contrast, no correlation was obtained for leaves collected during summer. With leaves from glasshouse grown vines, wounding or infection with powdery mildew increased both chitinase and \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucanase activity. Light microscope examination of detached leaves inoculated with U. necator conidia showed that germination appeared to occur at the same rate on leaves of a susceptible (Sultana) and a resistant (Seyval) genotype. Subsequent development of mycelia was severely restricted on the resistant genotype but it was prolific on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6404400844732052311", "cites_id": ["6404400844732052311"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.1998.tb00130.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VzN35aIA4VgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 9, "2009": 8, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 12, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
