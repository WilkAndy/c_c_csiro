Citrus seed storage proteins were used as markers to compare embryogenesis in developing seeds and somatic embryogenesis in vitro. The salt-soluble, globulin protein fraction (designated citrin) was purified from Citrus sinensis cv Valencia seeds. Citrins separated into two subunits averaging 22 and 33 kD under denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cDNA clone was isolated representing a citrin gene expressed in seeds when the majority of embryos were at the early globular stage of embryo development. The predicted protein sequence was most related to the globulin seed storage proteins of pumpkin and cotton. Accumulation of 33-kD polypeptides was first detected in polyembryonic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14954772316131685078", "cites_id": ["14954772316131685078"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/110/2/599/6070046", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1vLfDzAGis8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 8, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 12, "2016": 15, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 5}}
