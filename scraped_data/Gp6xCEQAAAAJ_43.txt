Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical, produced both by tumour and host cells, and functions as a signalling molecule downstream of several angiogenic factors. Both pro-and antitumourigenic properties have been attributed to NO.Methods:The expression of the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) was knocked down in the C6 glioma cell line using constitutive expression of antisense RNA, and the effect of tumour-derived NO on tumour progression and angiogenesis was investigated.Results:Tumours in which iNOS expression was decreased displayed significantly reduced growth rates compared with tumours derived from parental C6 cells.
