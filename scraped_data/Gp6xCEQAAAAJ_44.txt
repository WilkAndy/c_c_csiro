Organic carbon is derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by photosynthetic carbon assimilation. In this process, CO2 is joined to an existing acceptor in such a way that a new carboxyl group is formed. For this process to continue, it is necessary that the CO2 acceptor is regenerated and, in for the plants to grow, it is necessary that the amount of this acceptor is increased. Unlike the Krebs cycle, the formulation of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle (PCR cycle) owes everything to the availability of radioactive CO2. The PCR cycle can be divided into three main aspects\u2014carboxylation, reduction, and regeneration. The carboxylase also functions as an oxygenase; however, in high CO2, it catalyzes the addition of one molecule of CO2 to one molecule of ribulose-l,5-P2 with the formation of two molecules of 3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3532326503858529101", "cites_id": ["3532326503858529101"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126754087500112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TWMvfT1YBTEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 8, "1983": 5, "1984": 12, "1985": 9, "1986": 18, "1987": 6, "1988": 6, "1989": 7, "1990": 4, "1991": 3, "1992": 6, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
