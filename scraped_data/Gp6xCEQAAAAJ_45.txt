This resulted in 48-fold purification with 70% recovery of activity and yielded up to 18 milligrams of rubisco activase protein from 100 grams of leaves. Based on these figures, the protein comprised approximately 2% by weight of soluble protein in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves. The preparations were at least 95% pure and were stable when frozen in liquid nitrogen. Addition of ATP during purification and storage was necessary to maintain activity. Assay of rubisco activase was based on its ability to promote activation of rubisco in the presence of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. There was an absolute requirement for ATP which could not be replaced by other nucleoside phosphates.
