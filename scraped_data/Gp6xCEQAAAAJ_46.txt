Inactivation of these enzymes with heat resulted in juice of lower color (absorbance measured at 420 nm), but POD was found to be more heat stable than PPO. Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) completely inhibited PPO activity and markedly reduced juice color but had no effect on POD activity. Removal of oxygen in the presence of the substratechlorogenic acid also stopped color formation. Upon subsequent addition of oxygen, browning continued, indicating that the process was oxygen dependent. Color development in juice was complete after 20-30 min even though PPO was still active. Addition ofchlorogenic acid at this point restarted browning, suggesting that color development was limited by the availability of phenolic substrates. Varietal differences were observed in levels of PPO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17834746891974111676", "cites_id": ["17834746891974111676"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf00038a006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vHEeQ86_gfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 10, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 15, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 4}}
