This in vitro decline in rubisco activity, termed fall-over, was prevented if purified rubisco activase protein and ATP were added, allowing linear rates of CO2 fixation for up to 20 minutes. Rubisco activase could also stimulate rubisco activity if added after fallover had occurred. Gel filtration of the RuBP-rubisco complex to remove unbound RuBP allowed full activation of the enzyme, but the inhibition of activated rubisco during fallover was only partially reversed by gel filtration. Addition of alkaline phosphatase completely restored rubisco activity following fallover. The results suggest that fallover is not caused by binding of RuBP to decarbamylated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9256152871929822762", "cites_id": ["9256152871929822762"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/90/3/968/6084328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Kr4W7v51dIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 10, "1991": 9, "1992": 6, "1993": 5, "1994": 8, "1995": 6, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 8, "1999": 6, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
