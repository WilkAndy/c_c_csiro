The content of K+, Na+, and Cl\u2212 was determined together with the chloroplast volume from which the apparent concentration of these ions in the chloroplast was calculated. It was demonstrated by successive washing that K+ leaked out of the chloroplasts during isolation whereas Na+ and Cl\u2212 did not. For spinach and sugarbeet chloroplasts K+ was the predominant monovalent cation (160\u2013200 mm) with Na+ present in lesser amounts (40\u201370 mm). Pea chloroplasts contained equal amounts of K+ and Na+ (40 mm). The Cl\u2212 concentration in the chloroplast was similar for the three species and was calculated to be near 100 mm. The Cl\u2212 concentration in the chloroplast was well above that of the leaf tissue implying accumulation of Cl\u2212 in the chloroplast \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2754776636400317228", "cites_id": ["2754776636400317228"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003986184900614", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LLMvYMHuOiYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 8, "1986": 6, "1987": 6, "1988": 5, "1989": 4, "1990": 6, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
