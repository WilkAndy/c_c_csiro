The boxes were designed to maintain airflow while excluding light and thus to minimise changes in temperature and humidity. There was no significant effect of shading on sugar accumulation and in two of the three seasons studied there was no effect on berry weight. Chlorophyll concentration was much lower in the shaded fruit, which appeared pale yellow until veraison. The fruit coloured normally in the shaded bunches and in two of the three seasons there was no significant change in anthocyanin content. Expression of the gene encoding UDP\u2010glucose flavonoid\u20103\u2010O\u2010glucosyl transferase (UFGT), a key gene in anthocyanin synthesis, increased after veraison and was similar in both shaded and exposed fruit. Anthocyanin composition was altered in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 644, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3335281654841119426", "cites_id": ["3335281654841119426"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2004.tb00008.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wpKudv5MSS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 11, "2006": 19, "2007": 15, "2008": 29, "2009": 19, "2010": 29, "2011": 35, "2012": 41, "2013": 50, "2014": 47, "2015": 46, "2016": 48, "2017": 30, "2018": 47, "2019": 48, "2020": 35, "2021": 35, "2022": 38, "2023": 11}}
