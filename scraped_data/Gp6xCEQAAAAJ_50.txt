Mangoes of the Kensington cultivar are particularly susceptible to sapburn injury. On centrifugation, the fruit sap separated into two phases. Skin damage was caused predominantly by the upper non-aqueous phase. A major component of this phase was terpinolene which gave symptoms indistinguishable from sapburn injury when applied to the fruit surface. The same type of damage could be induced by the application of synthetic terpinolene when applied undiluted, diluted in hexane or as an aqueous emulsion. Non-volatile sap components separated by distillation were not damaging to mango skin. Sap exuded from the mango leaf petioles also contained terpinolene, but its concentration was less than 1% of the concentration in pedicel sap and this sap \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7094979031770293855", "cites_id": ["7094979031770293855"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9920449", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X2aDrdZtdmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
