Treatments which decreased stromal ATP, such as incubation with the ATP analog \u03b2,\u03b3-methylene adenosine triphosphate or with the energy transfer inhibitor phloridzin inhibited the light activation of rubisco. In the absence of added inorganic phosphate (Pi), light activation of rubisco was inhibited, coincident with low stromal ATP. Addition of methyl viologen restored both stromal ATP and rubisco activity to levels observed in the presence of Pi. Activation of rubisco was inhibited in the presence of 2 millimolar dihydroxyacetone phosphate or 3-phosphoglycerate and stromal ATP was also decreased under these conditions. Both were partially restored by increasing the Pi concentration. The strong correlation between activation state of rubisco and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6196432101605579554", "cites_id": ["6196432101605579554"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/86/1/293/6082895", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IhsHkyom_lUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 4, "1989": 10, "1990": 19, "1991": 4, "1992": 4, "1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
