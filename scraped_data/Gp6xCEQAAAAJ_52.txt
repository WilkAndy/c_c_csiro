The plants grew poorly in the absence of added NaCl and optimal growth, based on fresh or dry weight, occurred at 50-150 mM NaCl. Higher concentrations of NaCl decreased growth although the plants continued to grow even at 600 mM NaCl. The osmotic potential of the leaf sap decreased with increasing salinity and this was mostly the result of accumulation of NaCl in the leaves. Leaf K+ concentration decreased with increasing salinity while both Na+ and Cl- increased, reaching 800 and 500 mM, respectively, on a tissue water basis. Intact chloroplasts were isolated by mechanically disrupting the leaves and the chloroplasts were purified on a two-step Percoll gradient. The osmotic potential of the isolation medium was adjusted so as to be isotonic with the leaf sap in each case. The chloroplasts were generally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2506186114440973622", "cites_id": ["2506186114440973622"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9850471", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nk1FJP7CxyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 5, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 5, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
