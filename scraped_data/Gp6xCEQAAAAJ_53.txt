Overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which metabolizes the endogenous inhibitors of NO synthesis asymmetric dimethylarginine and N-monomethyl-l-arginine, results in C6 gliomas with enhanced growth rate compared with wild type. To investigate the effects of DDAH on tumor vascular morphogenesis in vivo, we have measured the transverse relaxation rates R2* and R2 in clone D27 gliomas overexpressing DDAH and C6 wild-type gliomas using intrinsic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sensitive to changes in endogenous [deoxyhemoglobin], and susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI using the intravascular blood pool contrast agent NC100150, and we compared the results with fluorescence microscopy of the tumor uptake of the perfusion marker \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2682984331895813140", "cites_id": ["2682984331895813140"], "pub_url": "https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/63/16/4960/510261", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FLSW6AjgOyUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 10, "2007": 12, "2008": 8, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
