Tissue homogenates were suspended in 80% (v/v) ethanol to minimise the loss of water-soluble wall components and wet-sieved on nylon mesh to remove cytoplasmic material. The cell wall fragments retained on the sieve were subsequently treated with buffered phenol at pH\u20097.0, to inactivate any wall-bound enzymes and to dislodge small amounts of cytoplasmic proteins that adhered to the walls. Finally, the wall preparation was washed with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) to remove lipids and dried by solvent exchange. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the wall preparation was essentially free of vascular tissue and adventitious protein of cytoplasmic origin. Compositional analysis showed that the walls consisted of approximately 90% by weight of polysaccharide and less than 10% protein.
