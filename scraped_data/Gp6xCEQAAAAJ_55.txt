The intact chloroplast comprises three distinct entities: (1) the thylakoid membranes, which contain the pigments, components of the electron-transport chain, and the coupling factor for photophosphorylation, (2) the stroma, which contains soluble proteins including those necessary for photosynthetic carbon reduction, plus metabolites and other salts, and (3) the envelope membranes, which enclose the organelle and also contain the metabolite translocators. Intact chloroplasts capable of high rates of photosynthesis can be prepared from many species, such as cereals, only by first digesting the leaves with cellulase and pectinase to obtain protoplasts and then rupturing these to release the chloroplasts. The metabolic activity of isolated chloroplasts cannot exceed that of the parent tissue, but in addition, healthy and rapidly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13045522070377658686", "cites_id": ["13045522070377658686"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0076687987480178", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PvlgcjQBC7UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 5, "1990": 2, "1991": 7, "1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 2, "1996": 9, "1997": 4, "1998": 7, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
