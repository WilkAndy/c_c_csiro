The white regions of tissue have decreased polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity resulting in a reduced capacity for browning. Active PPO from Sultana grapes was purified and had an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blots indicated that mature Sultana grapes contained a single 40-kilodalton PPO, and young Sultana berries also had small quantities of a 60-kilodalton protein. Bruce's Sport grapes had much less of the 40-kilodalton PPO and greater amounts of the 60-kilodalton band. Protease digestion of Bruce's Sport extracts decreased the proportion of the 60-kilodalton protein and increased the 40-kilodalton band. A cDNA clone of grape PPO was used to probe a northern blot of Sultana and Bruce's Sport RNA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12537383787295580053", "cites_id": ["12537383787295580053"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/99/4/1619/6088351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lZ9-7iC8_a0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 8, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
