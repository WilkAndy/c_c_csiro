When chloroplasts were isolated in hypertonic media (720 millimolar sorbitol, \u22122.0 megapascals osmotic potential) the optimum osmotic potential for photosynthesis was shifted to \u22121.8 megapascals and the chloroplasts had higher rates of CO2-dependent O2 evolution than chloroplasts isolated in 330 millimolar sorbitol when both were assayed at high solute concentrations.Transfer of chloroplasts isolated in 330 millimolar sorbitol to 720 millimolar sorbitol resulted in decreased chloroplast volume but this shrinkage was only transient and the chloroplasts subsequently swelled so that within 2 to 3 minutes at 20\u00b0C the chloroplast volume had returned to near the original value. Thus, actual steady state chloroplast volume \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:uVUOdF_882EC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15717560618406516616", "cites_id": ["15717560618406516616"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/79/4/996/6083739", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iBfKcxv-H9oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 2, "1988": 8, "1989": 5, "1990": 6, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
