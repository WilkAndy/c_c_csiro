We have previously shown that in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) PA synthesis involves both leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR). Here we report the characterization of a grapevine MYB transcription factor VvMYBPA1, which controls expression of PA pathway genes including both LAR and ANR. Expression of VvMYBPA1 in grape berries correlated with PA accumulation during early berry development and in seeds. In a transient assay, VvMYBPA1 activated the promoters of LAR and ANR, as well as the promoters of several of the general flavonoid pathway genes. VvMYBPA1 did not activate the promoter of VvUFGT, which encodes the anthocyanin-specific enzyme UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 597, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8577363728179011985", "cites_id": ["8577363728179011985"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/143/3/1347/6106724", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kSFur93qCHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 19, "2009": 37, "2010": 35, "2011": 30, "2012": 41, "2013": 44, "2014": 52, "2015": 45, "2016": 35, "2017": 33, "2018": 37, "2019": 39, "2020": 42, "2021": 42, "2022": 43, "2023": 16}}
