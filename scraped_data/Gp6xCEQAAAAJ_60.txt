Muscat of Alexandria) were grown on their own shoots until maturity or, after approach\u2010grafting before flowering, on the shoots of the non\u2010floral cv Shiraz (in the glasshouse) or Sultana (in the field). The flavour compounds of their berries were compared with those in the berries of the non\u2010floral cultivars, grown either on their own shoots or, by grafting, on the shoots of the Muscat cultivar. For this, monoterpene glycosides were isolated from the fruits, enzymatically hydrolysed and the released monoterpene aglycons were liquid\u2010liquid extracted and analysed by GC\u2010MS. The Muscat Gordo Blanco berries of ungrafted bunches and of bunches grafted onto Shiraz or Sultana vines yielded fruit with monoterpenes at levels and types typical of this floral grape variety. The berries of Shiraz and Sultana bunches contained only low levels of monoterpene \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10315151082764746834", "cites_id": ["10315151082764746834"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.1995.tb00073.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UsCt_EHHJo8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 6, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
