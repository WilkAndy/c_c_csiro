Paler colored sugar has a potential market premium over darker sugar. In an attempt to alter the level of PPO activity in transgenic plants, sense and antisense constructs containing the native sugarcane PPO gene were introduced into sugarcane by biolistics. In a series of field experiments, it was demonstrated that PPO activity among clones correlated significantly with juice color. In laboratory crystallizations of raw sugar using juice derived from clones with high and low PPO activity, the juice with the higher PPO activity produced darker colored crystals. PPO activity was elevated and juice color was darker in all types of transgenic plants. However, clones derived from a sense \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12851104082432529216", "cites_id": ["12851104082432529216"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2005.0354", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QJP2LBNLWLIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
