There were characteristic changes in room temperature fluorescence induction kinetics with increased initial yield (Fo) and decreased variable fluorescence (Fv). The fluorescence yield after the maximum fell rapidly to a level below Fo. The shape of the rise from Fo to the maximum was altered and the size of photosystem II units increased, as measured by half-rise time of Fv in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The Mn-deficient leaves were harvested before necrosis, when thin section electron microscopy revealed no disorganization of the thylakoid system. Thylakoid membranes were examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The effect of Mn-deficiency was the specific loss of three \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14427698868200437667", "cites_id": ["14427698868200437667"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/74/3/735/6079598", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o3dk7a17OcgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 3, "1986": 10, "1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 2, "1990": 4, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
