The kinetics of the distribution of labeled metabolities between the fractions indicated carbon flow from the chloroplasts into the cytosol and the vacuole. After 10 min of photosynthesis, more than 90% of the assimilated soluble carbon was outside the chloroplasts. Different metabolite levels indicated intracellular metabolite compartmentation and metabolite gradients. During photosynthesis, gradient coupling facilitated uphill export of triosephosphate from the chloroplasts into the cytosol. The driving force appeared to be an opposite phosphate gradient. Different ratios of phosphoglycerate to triosephosphate inside and outside the chloroplasts indicated the existence of a transenvelope pH gradient.
