Oxygen evolution by reconstituted chloroplasts with 3-phosphoglycerate as substrate was inhibited by ADP. This inhibition was overcome by increased concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate or by the addition of excess ATP. 2. The initial rate of 3-phosphoglycerate reduction by chloroplast stromal extracts, measured as 3-phosphoglycerate-dependent oxidation of NADPH, was also dependent on the concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate, ADP and ATP. 3. Within the range of concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate, ADP and ATP expected to occur within intact chloroplasts, the rate of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) reduction by stromal extract was proportional to the ratio [ATP][PGA]/[ADP]. 4. These results are consistent with the notion that the substrates and products of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase control the rate of 3-phosphoglycerate reduction via a mass action effect."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4579918903158767241", "cites_id": ["4579918903158767241"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/427144", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:if7fGvojjz8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 6, "1985": 5, "1986": 7, "1987": 10, "1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
