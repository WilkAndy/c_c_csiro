Glycerate uptake was 3 to 5 times higher in the light than in darkness, the stimulation by light being abolished by the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone. The pH optimum for uptake was 7.0 at 2\u00b0C and 8.5 at 20\u00b0C, but at all pH values the rate of uptake was higher at 20\u00b0C than at 2\u00b0C. Uptake was concentration dependent, saturating above 8 millimolar glycerate. At 2\u00b0C, the K m was 0.3 millimolar and the V max was 13 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour. At 20\u00b0C initial rates of glycerate uptake were higher than 40 micromoles per milligram of chlorophyll per hour.Although there was some metabolism of glycerate by chloroplasts in the light, even at 2C, the actual concentration of glycerate in the stroma, determined by chromatography \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:kVjdVfd2voEC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13513378991974787438", "cites_id": ["13513378991974787438"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/70/4/1032/6078846", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:binio5gqibsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 6, "1984": 14, "1985": 8, "1986": 7, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
