Diurnal changes in stomatal conductance and foliar abscisic acid (ABA) were small and the ABA content of expressed xylem sap was low (0\u00b73 to 0\u00b79 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol m\u22123). This concentration of ABA was too low to influence stomatal conductance, although diurnal changes and some seasonal changes in leaf ABA could be accounted for by uptake from the xylem. Water potential fell throughout the growing season but high values of turgor were maintained by a corresponding fall in leaf osmotic potential. The fall in leaf osmotic potential was partly accounted for by a decrease in relative water content but measurements of osmotic potential at full turgor showed that there was a net accumulation of solute between December and March \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11555772137300268398", "cites_id": ["11555772137300268398"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb04878.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bpUjpYhZXqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 5, "1989": 4, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
