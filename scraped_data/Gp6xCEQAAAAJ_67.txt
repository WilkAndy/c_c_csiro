Maltose was not detected in protoplasts prepared in the normal enzyme medium. Rapid separation of cytoplasm and chloroplasts following exposure to 14CO2 showed that maltose was present in both fractions. Direct measurements of [14C]maltose uptake indicated transport across the chloroplast envelope at rates similar to the transport of glucose. The source of maltose and site of its initial formation are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6116032650759545524", "cites_id": ["6116032650759545524"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/67/1/85/6080071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tKI2r0qD4FQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 5, "1983": 2, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 4, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 5, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
