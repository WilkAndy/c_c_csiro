Sugarcane PPO with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa was purified to homogeneity from immature stem tissue. Western analysis of sugarcane extracts with a polyclonal antibody raised to this protein suggested it resulted from cleavage of a 60 kDa protein during purification. The antibody was used to screen a sugarcane stem cDNA library. A full-length PPO clone (sugppol) was characterised and shown to encode a 67 kDa precursor protein comprising a plastid transit sequence of 8 kDa and a mature PPO protein of 59 kDa. High levels of expression ofsugppol were detected in the growing point of the stalk and in the immature tissue immediately below it, but no message was detected in RNA from mature stem or leaf. Comparison with other PPO sequences indicated thatsugppol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6494627305270053551", "cites_id": ["6494627305270053551"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00040840", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r4osxx-NIVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 7, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 8, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
