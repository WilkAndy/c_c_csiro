Evidence for non-stomatal inhibition was not observed in spinach (Spinacia oleracea). There was no significant decrease in rates of electron transport nor ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activity in intact chloroplasts isolated from ABA-treated sunflower leaves. Oxygen evolution by leaf discs with 3% CO2 in the gas phase was inhibited in ABA- treated sunflower and apricot leaves but not in spinach; the inhibition was only half as great as the inhibition of assimilation rate at ambient CO2. The quantum yield of oxygen evolution decreased in ABA-treated sunflower leaves in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8976998627307279604", "cites_id": ["8976998627307279604"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/PP9880495", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9NTRebC0lHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 5, "1991": 6, "1992": 11, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
