Two enzymes, leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), can produce the flavan-3-ol monomers required for formation of PA polymers. We isolated and functionally characterized genes encoding both enzymes from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv Shiraz). ANR was encoded by a single gene, but we found two highly related genes encoding LAR. We measured PA content and expression of genes encoding ANR, LAR, and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase in grape berries during development and in grapevine leaves, which accumulated PA throughout leaf expansion. Grape flowers had high levels of PA, and accumulation continued in skin and seeds from fruit set until the onset of ripening. VvANR was expressed throughout early \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 573, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18261108262001030711", "cites_id": ["18261108262001030711"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/139/2/652/6113426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N7aFeTZ9bP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 12, "2007": 21, "2008": 27, "2009": 27, "2010": 39, "2011": 26, "2012": 47, "2013": 43, "2014": 43, "2015": 39, "2016": 36, "2017": 27, "2018": 27, "2019": 39, "2020": 33, "2021": 28, "2022": 46, "2023": 10}}
