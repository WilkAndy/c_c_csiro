Addition of exogenous ATP in the dark increased stromal pH by 0.3\u20130.4 pH units and increased the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane by a similar amount. In the dark, dihydroxyacetone phosphate plus oxaloacetate increased stromal ATP to levels equal to those obtained in illuminated chloroplasts, but stromal pH was only increased by 0.1\u20130.3 pH units compared to an increase of 0.8\u20131.0 units in the light. The energy-transfer inhibitor, phlorizin, decreased stromal ATP in illuminated chloroplasts almost to dark levels, but did not decrease stromal pH. Inorganic pyrophosphate and an analog of ATP were used to exchange endogenous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=640216487150809258", "cites_id": ["640216487150809258"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0005272885900969", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qvD4x4CB4ggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 3, "1987": 6, "1988": 5, "1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
