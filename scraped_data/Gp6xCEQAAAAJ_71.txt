In the absence of Pi photosynthesis declined after the first 1\u20132 min and was less than 10% of the maximum rate after 5 min. Export from the chloroplast was inhibited, with up to 60% of the 14C fixed being retained in the chloroplast, compared to less than 20% in the presence of Pi. Despite the decreased export, chloroplasts depleted of Pi had lower levels of triose phosphate while the percentage of total phosphate in 3-phosphoglycerate was increased. Chloroplast ATP declined during Pi depletion and reached dark levels after 3\u20134 min in the light without added Pi. At this point, stromal Pi concentration was 0.2 mM, which would be limiting to ATP synthesis. Addition of Pi resulted in a rapid burst of oxygen evolution which was not initially \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12682536096399487923", "cites_id": ["12682536096399487923"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00032706", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s_P1fGJrAbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 6, "1990": 5, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
