Exudate collected from the cut hypocotyl of 4-day seedlings contained 120 millimolar soluble amino nitrogen and glutamine was the predominant amino acid present, comprising 35 to 40% of the total amino nitrogen. To determine the nature of nitrogen transfer, the endosperm and hypocotyl were removed and glutamine uptake by the excised cotyledons was investigated. Uptake was linear for at least 2 hours and the cotyledons actively accumulated glutamine against a concentration gradient. The uptake was sensitive to respiratory inhibitors and uncouplers and efflux of glutamine from the excised cotyledons was negligible. Transport was specific for the l-isomer. Other neutral amino acids were transported at similar rates to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11831141546383276906", "cites_id": ["11831141546383276906"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/68/3/560/6077776", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:anuKZ42oMKQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 4, "1984": 4, "1985": 7, "1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 6, "1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
