The enzyme can be reactivated by incubation with CO2 and Mg 2\u0169 and the experiments in [5] suggest that the enzyme first reacts slowly with CO2 (eq.(1)) to form an inactive enzyme-CO2 complex which subsequently reacts rapidly with Mg 2\u0169 to form the active complex, enzyme-CO2-Mg 2\u0169 (eq.(2))."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9216373949592675347", "cites_id": ["9216373949592675347"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82448645.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E6Si1kYj538J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 10, "1981": 10, "1982": 6, "1983": 5, "1984": 6, "1985": 3, "1986": 0, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
