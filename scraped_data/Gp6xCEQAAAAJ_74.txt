The cotyledons retain the ability to absorb amino acids after removal of the endosperm and hypocotyl, exhibiting rates of transport up to 70 \u03bcmol g-1 h-1. The transport of L-glutamine was not altered by KCl or NaCl in low concentrations (0\u201320 mM). High concentrations of KCl (100 mM) inhibited transport, presumably by decreasing the membrane potential. An increase in the pH of the medium bathing the cotyledons was observed for 10 min following addition of L-glutamine but not with D-glutamine, which is not transported. The rate of proton uptake was dependent on the concentration of L-glutamine in the external solution.
