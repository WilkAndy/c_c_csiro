Massey Gem) chloroplasts was increased two to 12 times by the addition of ATP. O2 evolution was also stimulated by ADP and to a lesser extent by AMP. The ATP effects were not due to broken chloroplasts present in the preparations nor was ATP acting as a phosphate source. We concluded that the adenine nucleotides were acting catalytically. The concentration of ATP required for half-maximum rate of O2 evolution was 16 to 25 \u03bcm. The degree to which ATP stimulated O2 evolution depended on the age of pea plants from which the chloroplasts were isolated. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea var. True Hybrid 102) chloroplasts did not show a consistent stimulation of O2 evolution by adenine nucleotides.The adenine nucleotide content of pea chloroplasts was not lower than that of spinach chloroplasts, but pea chloroplasts which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14323132776584684257", "cites_id": ["14323132776584684257"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/58/2/156/6075127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4aIVg1_9xcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 4, "1980": 3, "1981": 2, "1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 2, "1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
