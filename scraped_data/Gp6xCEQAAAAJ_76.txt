Nonaqueous fractionation of leaf tissue [2] suggested that at least some of the enzymes responsible for sucrose synthesis were located in the chloroplast but the nonaqueous chloroplasts were contaminated by cytoplasm [3]. Later work [4] showed that only a small percentage of the activity of these enzymes was recovered in chloroplasts prepared by aqueous methods suggesting a cytoplasmic site for sucrose synthesis. Studies on the distribution of sucrose between chloroplast and cytoplasm after nonaqueous extraction of leaves which had been illuminated in 14C02 showed that some of the sucrose was in the chloroplast fraction [5-71 but it was concluded from kinetic measurements [6] that the cytoplasm was probably the major site of sucrose synthesis. The chloroplast envelope was shown to be relatively impermeable to sucrose [8] and it seemed that if sucrose was synthesised in the chloroplast, it would not be transported out into the cytoplasm and so could not be exported from the leaf. There is one report of isolated chloroplasts synthesising sucrose from CO? but this appeared to be a seasonal effect and could not be repeated at will [9]. One possible explanation for this result comes from [lo] where, in normal chloroplast preparations, a small proportion of chloroplasts was found bounded by a layer of cytoplasm. When these bodies were separated from the rest of the preparation they synthesised sucrose and it seems likely that under some conditions the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12266888635917193203", "cites_id": ["12266888635917193203"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82104728.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:888euzi-PKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 5, "1984": 2, "1985": 3, "1986": 2, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
