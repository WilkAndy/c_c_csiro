Pi was determined calorimetrically or by high performance liquid chromatography of extracts of chloroplasts labelled with 32Pi. When chloroplasts were illuminated in the absence of added Pi, photosynthesis soon declined due to Pi-depletion. After 5 min in the light, photosynthesis had declined to 2% of the maximum rate. At this point, stromal Pi was estimated to be 1.4 mM by the colorimetric method and 0.2 mM by 32P chromatography. Using the colorimetric method, Pi equivalent to approximately 1 mM in the stroma was found to be associated with thylakoid membranes isolated from chloroplasts, irrespective of the Pi content of the intact chloroplasts. This was considered to be a non-metabolic pool of Pi.
