All of the tissues contained proanthocyanidins, but only the berry skin accumulated anthocyanins. In most tissues, all of the flavonoid genes except UDP glucose-flavonoid 3-o-glucosyl transferase (UFGT) were expressed, but UFGT expression was only detected in berry skin. Similar patterns of expression were observed in the skin of other red grapes. In white grapes, UFGT expression was not detected. White grape cultivars appear to lack anthocyanins because they lack UFGT, although they also had decreased expression of other flavonoid pathway genes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 499, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5724563232974733528", "cites_id": ["5724563232974733528"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00019111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2IC4K-67cU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 8, "2002": 13, "2003": 10, "2004": 9, "2005": 9, "2006": 19, "2007": 8, "2008": 25, "2009": 22, "2010": 31, "2011": 18, "2012": 32, "2013": 30, "2014": 30, "2015": 33, "2016": 39, "2017": 24, "2018": 29, "2019": 20, "2020": 14, "2021": 21, "2022": 26, "2023": 11}}
