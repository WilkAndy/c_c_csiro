This technique avoids the insertion of an arteriovenous bridge and the need to clamp the circuit. We present data on five neonatal patients who were trialled off using this method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:isU91gLudPYC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5652713814704290781", "cites_id": ["5652713814704290781"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/asaiojournal/FullText/2013/09000/Pump_Controlled_Retrograde_Trial_Off_from_VA_ECMO.10.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Xtk3kN5ck4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
