PPO genes have been isolated from various pineapple tissues using PCR with redundant oligonucleotides and a cDNA which is specifically induced in blackheart affected fruit has been cloned. Suitable promoters to drive gene expression in pineapple have been defined and gene constructs suitable for transformation of the crop have been prepared. To generate transgenic pineapple we have established an efficient plant regeneration system based on the production of highly regenerable callus from leaf bases of tissue cultured plantlets. A transformation system based on micro-projectile bombardment of this regenerable callus has been developed. In addition, we have also transformed pineapple using Agrobacterium-mediated gene delivery to leaf bases, from which we have generated stably \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1366276509007168819", "cites_id": ["1366276509007168819"], "pub_url": "https://www.actahort.org/books/529/529_15.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M0VVAD_99RIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
