The biochemical basis for this decreased browning capacity was investigated. Bruce's Sport grapes had similar levels of phenolic compounds to Sultana H5. Activity of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO EC 1.10.3.1) in mature berries of Bruce's Sport was only 20-30% of that in Sultana H5. No evidence of inhibitors or activators of PPO was found when berry extracts were mixed. PPO activity on a fresh weight basis was highest in the grape seed traces, intermediate in the skin, and lowest in the pulp in both varieties. In each tissue type, however, PPO activity in Bruce's Sport was less than 25% of that in Sultana H5. On a fresh weight basis, PPO activity in Sultana H5 berries was high at fruit set then declined as the berry developed. PPO activity per berry increased from fruit set until veraison, then \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14919432531469044037", "cites_id": ["14919432531469044037"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9920043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RYmeQNd4DM8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
