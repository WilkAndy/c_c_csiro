When rates of 2 or 3^ moles\u00b7 rag-1 chlorophyll\u00b7 h were first reported by ARNON and his colleagues (1967) in the early 1950's it seemed probable that the chloroplast must be damaged. Subsequent improve ments in rate (WALKER 1964, 1978) were taken as an index of improved methods of separation. More recently it has been proposed that the chloro plast is not the self-sufficient organelle that many workers had supposed. It is now possible to isolate chloroplasts which will display the same rates of carbon assimilation as the parent tissue and it is more than likely that these high rates reflect a high degree of structural integrity.(Certainly carbon assimi lation will fall to near zero if intact chloroplasts are subjected to brief osmotic shock or subjected to attack by detergents.) On the other hand an intact chloro plast is like a stationary car, it will only display a fast rate if operated in a proper manner."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14109105309513545398", "cites_id": ["14109105309513545398"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1438-8677.1978.tb03672.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tvYhmIaczcMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 3, "1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 4, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
