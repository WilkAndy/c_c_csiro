Merr.), is susceptible to the internal browning disorder known as blackheart (also referred to as endogenous brown spot or internal browning). This disorder is induced by chilling and results in browning of the flesh and core of the fruit due to the oxidation of phenolic substances by the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. The hybrid pineapple cultivar Hawaiian Gold (53-116) is reported to be resistant to blackheart. Fruit of both Hawaiian Gold and Smooth Cayenne were stored for 14 days at 0, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 23\u02daC, followed by 7 days at 23\u02daC. Blackheart symptoms were observed in the flesh of Smooth Cayenne fruit chilled at 10\u02daC and they were progressively less severe at lower chilling temperatures, with no symptoms observed in the flesh of fruit chilled at 0\u02daC. Increased blackheart symptoms were observed in the core of the fruit at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2797596215310730537", "cites_id": ["2797596215310730537"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/EA01094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KcWSfu8O0yYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
