When fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activation was suppressed by low pH or treatment with dehydroascorbate induction was extended but preactivation by dithiothreitol did not bring about lag shortening. Conversely the lag could be extended or shortened by manipulation of the orthophosphate concentration in the medium without materially affecting fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activation. It is concluded that the normal induction lag displayed by isolated spinach chloroplasts is not readily explained in terms of initial inactivity of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Alternative explanations are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8948549091507808337", "cites_id": ["8948549091507808337"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003986180904695", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Uah3vvyhL3wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 0, "1985": 2, "1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
