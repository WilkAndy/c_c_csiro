The concentration of chelator, either EDTA or pyrophosphate (PPi), required for maximum activation depended on the pH, the concentration of orthophosphate (Pi) in the assay, and the chelator used. Studies with EDTA indicate that including the chelator in the isolation, resuspension, and assay media, in the absence of divalent cations, was most effective. Increased concentration of EDTA from 1 to 10 mm broadened the pH response curve for photosynthesis, inasmuch as a higher concentration of chelator was required for activation of photosynthesis at lower pH.Either EDTA, PPi, or citrate could activate photosynthesis of sunflower chloroplasts isolated and assayed at pH 8.4. At pH 7.6, PPi and EDTA were equally effective at low Pi \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6810623572528665814", "cites_id": ["6810623572528665814"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003986178902953", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1hR5Ew4yhF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1978": 1, "1979": 1, "1980": 3, "1981": 2, "1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
