Chloroplasts isolated in KCl exhibited higher rates of CO2-dependent oxygen evolution in nine out of ten experiments, the average increase being 43%. Chloroplasts isolated in KCl routinely achieved rates of CO2-dependent oxygen evolution of 200\u2013300 \u03bc mol\u00b7mg chlorophyll-1\u00b7hour-1 at 20\u00b0C. Intact chloroplasts were also isolated in media with 200 mM NaCl or choline chloride but the rates of CO2 fixation were not superior to those isolated in sorbitol media. The K+ content of chloroplasts isolated in KCl media was higher than for chloroplasts isolated in sorbitol. It is suggested that the use of KCl as an osmoticum prevents the loss of chloroplast K+ which can occur during isolation in sorbitol media. Chloroplasts isolated in KCl lost, on average, 36% of the initial CO2 fixation activity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16800745968825763141", "cites_id": ["16800745968825763141"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00024188", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RYVvyXE9KOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1}}
