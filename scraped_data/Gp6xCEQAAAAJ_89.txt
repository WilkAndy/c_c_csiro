Cabernet Sauvignon and Golden Muscat) by digestion with cellulase and driselase. The protoplasts were purified by floatation on a step gradient of Percoll. Purified protoplasts exhibited light-dependent oxygen evolution of 22\u201334 \u03bcmol O2/mg chlorophyll per h, which was comparable to rates of photosynthesis reported for grapevine leaves and leaf discs. The protoplasts were 90% intact based on polarographic determination of penetration of glycolate. The results indicate that the grapevine leaf protoplasts retained their photosynthetic activities and were metabolically competent."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9671094246417877766", "cites_id": ["9671094246417877766"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304421184902219", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BssPO_qgNoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
