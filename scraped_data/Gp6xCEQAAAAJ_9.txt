Shiraz grapes was determined by reversed\u2010phase HPLC after acetone extraction and acid\u2010catalysis in the presence of excess phloroglucinol. Samples were taken at weekly intervals from fruit\u2010set until commercial harvest. The main period of proanthocyanidin accumulation in grape seeds occurred immediately after fruit\u2010set with maximum levels observed around veraison. Over two seasons there was variation in both the timing and content of proanthocyanidins in seeds. In skin, proanthocyanidin accumulation occurred from fruit set until 1\u20132 weeks after veraison. Proanthocyanidin subunit composition was different in seeds and skin and changed during berry development but the mean degree of polymerisation of the tannin polymers in skins was higher than in the seeds at all stages of berry development \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 462, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16669395639493674242", "cites_id": ["16669395639493674242"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2003.tb00228.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AkV3EASXVecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 11, "2006": 18, "2007": 11, "2008": 17, "2009": 18, "2010": 26, "2011": 29, "2012": 43, "2013": 32, "2014": 24, "2015": 29, "2016": 21, "2017": 24, "2018": 30, "2019": 28, "2020": 25, "2021": 26, "2022": 23, "2023": 12}}
