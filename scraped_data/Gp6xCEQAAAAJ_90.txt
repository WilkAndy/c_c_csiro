In the grapevine, CHS is encoded by three similar genes (VvCHS1,2,3). Their expression patterns and regulation by MYB transcription factors were determined to identify the role of these three genes in the biosynthesis of different flavonoid compounds.Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the transcript level of VvCHS1 and VvCHS2 correlated with both flavonol and tannin accumulation in Shiraz vegetative and berry tissues, and in cell cultures. The transcript level of all three VvCHS genes correlated with an increase of anthocyanins in berry skins indicating their role in anthocyanin synthesis. MYB transcription factors regulating tannin and flavonol synthesis activated the VvCHS1 and VvCHS2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4356600729335592909", "cites_id": ["4356600729335592909"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajgw.12026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zXdB9EfBdTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
