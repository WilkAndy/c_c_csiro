The ATP analog, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate rapidly inhibited CO2-dependent oxygen evolution by isolated pea chloroplasts. Both \u03b1, \u03b2- and \u03b2, \u03b3-methylene adenosine triphosphate also inhibited oxygen evolution. The inhibition was relieved by ATP but only partially relieved by 3-phosphoglycerate. Oxygen evolution with 3-phosphoglycerate as substrate was inhibited by adenylyl-imidodiphosphate to a lesser extent than CO2-dependent oxygen evolution. The concentration of adenylyl-imidodiphosphate required for 50% inhibition of CO2-dependent oxygen evolution was 50 \u03bcM.2. Although non-cyclic photophosphorylation by broken chloroplasts was not significantly affected by adenylyl-imidodiphosphate, electron transport in the absence of ADP was inhibited by adenylyl-imidodiphosphate to the same extent as by ATP, suggesting binding of the ATP analog to the coupling factor of phosphorylation.3.
