Half-maximum stimulation occurred with 10 to 20 watts per square meter of red light. Preillumination of chloroplasts enhanced uptake in a subsequent dark period. The light effect was abolished by DCMU and also by uncoupling agents such as nigericin and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone.Arsenate and phlorizin only inhibited glycerate uptake to the extent that metabolism in the chloroplast was decreased by insufficient ATP. The concentration of glycerate accumulated in the chloroplast stroma was not significantly decreased. Chloroplasts isolated from young pea shoots (Pisum sativum, L. cv Massey Gem) were depleted of ATP by incubation with inorganic pyrophosphate or with ATP analogs. These treatments also decreased metabolism of glycerate but the actual concentration of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14188275547726317385", "cites_id": ["14188275547726317385"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/75/2/425/6079689", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SYeWHXDh5sQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 5, "1986": 5, "1987": 5, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
