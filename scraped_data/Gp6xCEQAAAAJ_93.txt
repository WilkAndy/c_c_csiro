The subcellular localization of this activity has been reinvestigated by differential centrifugation of spinach leaf homogenates. The fraction sedimenting at 1,200g comprised mostly intact chloroplasts and contained more than half the chlorophyll but only 5% of the 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase activity present in the homogenate. The fraction of the homogenate pelleting at 5,000g contained broken chloroplasts and had considerable 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase activity. Further purification of the 1,200g pellet fraction on a Percoll step gradient yielded greater than 95% intact chloroplasts, yet the phosphatase activity was reduced more than 15-fold on a chlorophyll basis by this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7637830687455724676", "cites_id": ["7637830687455724676"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/70/3/645/6078732", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hERgFIsG_2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 2, "1985": 2, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
