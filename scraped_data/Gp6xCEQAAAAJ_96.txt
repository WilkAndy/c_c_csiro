Photoinhibitibn (illumination for 8 min with 4000 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1 light in the absence of bicarbonate) decreased the subsequently measured rate of CO2 fixation. Individual compounds were differently affected: the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) pool was drastically lowered, while that of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) was increased, suggesting that photoinhibition causes a limitation in RuBP regeneration. An increase in FBP and decrease in RuBP were not observed during photosynthesis in low light at rates of CO2 fixation comparable to those in photoinhibited chloroplasts. This indicates that changes of the metabolite pools induced by photoinhibition were not due solely to decreased rates of electron transport.
