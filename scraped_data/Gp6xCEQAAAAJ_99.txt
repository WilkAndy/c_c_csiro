In this assay, the production of UDP is coupled to NADH oxidation by the enzymes nucleoside-5\u2032-diphosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. The assay could not be used with crude extracts, but was found suitable for use with partially purified sucrose phosphate synthetase from the leaves of spinach, wheat, and maize. It has obvious advantages for kinetic studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "Gp6xCEQAAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14665807662369246854", "cites_id": ["14665807662369246854"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003269780904911", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ho64u11qh8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 2, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
