The 1997/98 episode, often referred to as \u2018the climate event of the twentieth century\u2019,, and the 1982/83 extreme El Ni\u00f1o, featured a pronounced eastward extension of the west Pacific warm pool and development of atmospheric convection, and hence a huge rainfall increase, in the usually cold and dry equatorial eastern Pacific. Such a massive reorganization of atmospheric convection, which we define as an extreme El Ni\u00f1o, severely disrupted global weather patterns, affecting ecosystems,, agriculture, tropical cyclones, drought, bushfires, floods and other extreme weather events worldwide,,,. Potential future changes in such extreme El Ni\u00f1o occurrences could have profound socio-economic consequences. Here we present climate modelling evidence for a doubling in the occurrences in the future in response to greenhouse \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 2043, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10087494616749829681", "cites_id": ["10087494616749829681"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2100", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Me4Jeej6_YsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 46, "2015": 154, "2016": 160, "2017": 241, "2018": 292, "2019": 284, "2020": 265, "2021": 281, "2022": 205, "2023": 87}}
