The widely accepted but poorly quantified importance of these currents\u2014in processes such as the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Indonesian Throughflow\u2014has triggered renewed interest. Ongoing efforts are seeking to understand the heat and mass balances of the equatorial Pacific, and possible changes associated with greenhouse-gas-induced climate change. Only a concerted international effort will close the observational, theoretical and technical gaps currently limiting a robust answer to these elusive questions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 475, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4693847558126552042", "cites_id": ["4693847558126552042"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14504", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6sP3K3zlI0EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 33, "2017": 45, "2018": 41, "2019": 62, "2020": 67, "2021": 90, "2022": 94, "2023": 34}}
