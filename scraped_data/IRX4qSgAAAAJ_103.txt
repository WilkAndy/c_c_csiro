Such soil conservation measures and climate variability have had considerable impacts on annual streamflow from these catchments. However, much less is known about changes in groundwater storage as the period of direct groundwater storage measurements is too short to reliably infer groundwater storage trends. For this study, annual values of groundwater storage from 38 catchments in the Loess Plateau were estimated from daily streamflow records based on groundwater flow theory. It was found that over the period of record (viz. 1955\u20132010), statistically significant (p < 0.1) downward trends have been identified in 20 selected catchments with an average reduction of \u22120.0299 mm per year, mostly located \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4936543514926981509", "cites_id": ["4936543514926981509"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415007465", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hSF7ASwggkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
