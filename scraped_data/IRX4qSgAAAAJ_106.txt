During this season, the highest recorded positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) value was measured, adding weight to an association of a positive SAM with anomalously low SWWA winter rainfall (SWR), and vice\u2010versa. However, such a SAM\u2010SWR teleconnection has been recently questioned. Using observational data in the post\u20101979 satellite era, it is shown that such a SAM influence does exist. This coherence is confirmed with 1150 years of modelled 20th century SWR anomalies and SAM values from 23 climate models, showing that a nonlinear impact operates: the influence from a negative SAM is greater than that from a positive SAM. This explains why a small positive shift in the SAM can cause a large SWR reduction, as has been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=675738762685944315", "cites_id": ["675738762685944315"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011GL047943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-5HbDtO0YAkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
