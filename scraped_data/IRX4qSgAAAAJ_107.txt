The PDO exerts a substantial influence on marine ecosystems, fisheries and agriculture\u2013. Through modulating global mean temperature, the phase shift of the PDO at the end of the twentieth century is suggested to be an influential factor in the recent surface warming hiatus,. Determining the predictability of the PDO in a warming climate is therefore of great importance. By analysing future climate under different emission scenarios simulated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (ref. ), we show that the prediction lead time and the associated amplitude of the PDO decrease sharply under greenhouse warming conditions. This decrease is largely attributable to a warming-induced intensification of oceanic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:L1USKYWJimsC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12410514844665624724", "cites_id": ["12410514844665624724"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0663-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lLgBXH8BO6wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 14, "2022": 21, "2023": 11}}
