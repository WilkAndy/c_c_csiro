ENSO events tend to have a centre\u2014corresponding to the location of the maximum SST anomaly\u2014in either the central equatorial Pacific (5\u00b0 S\u20135\u00b0 N, 160\u00b0 E\u2013150\u00b0 W) or the eastern equatorial Pacific (5\u00b0 S\u20135\u00b0 N, 150\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 W); these two distinct types of ENSO event are referred to as the CP-ENSO and EP-ENSO regimes, respectively. How the ENSO may change under future greenhouse warming is unknown, owing to a lack of inter-model agreement over the response of SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific to such warming. Here we find a robust increase in future EP-ENSO SST variability among CMIP5 climate models that simulate the two distinct ENSO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 436, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17303483780844040386", "cites_id": ["17303483780844040386"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0776-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wjDxJdJSIvAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 57, "2020": 99, "2021": 107, "2022": 122, "2023": 39}}
