The cause(s) of this decline remain unclear. This study examines the interaction between remote large-scale climate modes and an atmospheric phenomenon known as the subtropical ridge (STR) at the local scale. A focus is placed on the utility of using the STR as a bridge for understanding how these remote climate drivers influence SEA rainfall through a response in local atmospheric conditions. Using observational data since 1979, it is found that a strong seasonality exists in the impact of the STR on SEA rainfall. In  austral autumn, because SEA rainfall is poorly correlated with the STR intensity (STRI) and STR position (STRP) on an interannual basis, it follows that most of the autumn rainfall reduction cannot be explained by the STRI changes in this season \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16962968034570523404", "cites_id": ["16962968034570523404"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/24/23/2011jcli4149.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DNPhxI2RaOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
