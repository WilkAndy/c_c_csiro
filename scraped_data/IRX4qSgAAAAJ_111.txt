Given that aerosol\u2010induced cooling is greater in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), do aerosols induce a greater impact on NH oceanic heat content? Sea level rise over the past 50 years has shown little hemispheric differentiation. Using a set of global climate model experiments forced with and without anthropogenic aerosols, we show that increasing aerosols in the 20th century induce a pan\u2010oceanic heat redistribution. This leads to a reduction in the SH oceanic heat content comparable to that in the NH oceans. The process includes a strengthening of the northward cross\u2010equatorial heat transport in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with the majority taking place in the Atlantic Ocean via the most effective pathway: the globally interconnected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9021901491674430971", "cites_id": ["9021901491674430971"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006GL027513", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-z3SSZs7NH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
