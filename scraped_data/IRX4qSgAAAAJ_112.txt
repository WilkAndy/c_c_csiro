Although the growth of the EEIO cold anomalies involves forcing by equatorial nonlinear advection, unique to the 2019 pIOD is an air\u2010sea heat flux that was a forcing to the EEIO cold anomalies, rather than a damping as in previous extreme events. This unique thermodynamic forcing is due to a large latent cooling, which is supported by an unusually strong wind speed contributed by a large southerly anomaly as part of a long\u2010term trend. The wind trend is underpinned by a mean state SST change featuring slower warming off Sumatra\u2010Java. Given that a similar SST trend pattern is projected under greenhouse warming, the likelihood of such thermodynamical forcing operating more frequently in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9652898816758325865", "cites_id": ["9652898816758325865"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088615", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aSKroVT89YUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 21, "2022": 20, "2023": 5}}
