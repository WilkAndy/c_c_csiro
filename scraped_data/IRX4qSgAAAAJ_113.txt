In its sixth assessment, the IPCC reports no systematic change in ENSO SST variability under any emission scenarios considered. However, comparison between the 20th and 21st century shows a robust increase in century-long ENSO SST variability under four IPCC plausible emission scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=212450667595529719", "cites_id": ["212450667595529719"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01282-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:931TrsHG8gIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 24, "2023": 25}}
