The seesaw pattern is postulated to be linked to a super El Ni\u00f1o and the Arctic Oscillation (AO). During the mature phase of El Ni\u00f1o in December 2015, the weakened East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and the associated low-level southerly wind anomaly reduced planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, favoring strong haze formation. This circulation pattern was completely reversed in the following month, in part due to a sudden phase change of the AO from positive to negative and the beginning of a decay of the El Ni\u00f1o, which enhanced the southward shift of the upper tropospheric jet from December to January relative to climatology, leading to an enhanced EAWM and substantially lower haze formation. This sub-seasonal change in circulation is also robustly found in 1982\u20131983 and 1997\u20131998, implicative of a general physical mechanism dynamically linked to El Ni\u00f1o and the AO. Numerical experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model were used to test the modulation of the meteorological conditions on haze formation. With the same emission, simulations for three super El Ni\u00f1o periods (1983, 1997 and 2015) robustly show higher PM concentrations under the mature phase of the super El Ni\u00f1o, but substantially lower PM concentrations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5721097920505831055", "cites_id": ["5721097920505831055"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/565/2019/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j975PD9sZU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 11, "2021": 12, "2022": 15, "2023": 10}}
