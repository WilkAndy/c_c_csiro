For example, the maximum warm anomalies of El Ni\u00f1o, which occur in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, are larger than the maximum cold anomalies of La Ni\u00f1a, which are centred in the equatorial central Pacific Ocean\u2013. The associated atmospheric nonlinear thermal damping cools the equatorial Pacific during El Ni\u00f1o but warms it during La Ni\u00f1a,. Under greenhouse warming, climate models project an increase in the frequency of strong El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, but the change differs vastly across models, which is partially attributed to internal variability\u2013. Here we show that like a butterfly effect, an infinitesimal random perturbation to identical initial conditions induces vastly different initial ENSO variability, which systematically affects its response to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8488202514124516843", "cites_id": ["8488202514124516843"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2641-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6y340zYnzHUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 15, "2022": 15, "2023": 14}}
