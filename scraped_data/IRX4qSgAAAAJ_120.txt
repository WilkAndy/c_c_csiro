We examine the robustness of the amount of energy that leaves the Pacific via each of the pathway using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation with the Parallel Ocean Program (SODA\u2010POP) reanalysis and a multi\u2010century coupled model control experiment. We find that in the pre\u20101980 period, little ENSO signal is transmitted to the Indian Ocean and does not involve the subtropical NP pathway. Such multidecadal variability is periodically produced by the climate model. Examinations reveal that when ENSO is weak as determined by Ni\u00f1o3.4, their meridional extent is narrow, the associated discharge\u2010recharge does not involve the subtropical NP pathway; further, weak ENSO events have a low signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio, making the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10139117660595340975", "cites_id": ["10139117660595340975"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007GL029528", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r8as_8phtYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 10, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
