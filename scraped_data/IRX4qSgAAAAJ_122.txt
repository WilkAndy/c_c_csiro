Several mechanisms have been proposed for this asymmetry, but because of a lack of observations the role of various processes remains contentious. Using Argo profiles and other newly available data, the authors provide an observation-based assessment of the IOD skewness. First, the role of a nonlinear dynamical heating process is reaffirmed, which reinforces IODE cold anomalies but damps IODE warm anomalies. This reinforcing effect is greater than the damping effect, further contributing to the skewness. Second, the existence of a thermocline\u2013temperature feedback asymmetry, whereby IODE cold anomalies induced by a shoaling thermocline are greater than warm anomalies associated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7864945476686019226", "cites_id": ["7864945476686019226"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/9/jcli-d-12-00483.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mnqvoz3mJW0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
