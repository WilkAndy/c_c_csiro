It is suggested that this interaction mechanism is important in maintaining this phenomenon in both the model and the real atmosphere\u2013ocean but is not strong enough to initiate it. Through use of a simple model consisting of a zonally periodic midlatitude beta plane with a uniform mean north\u2013south temperature gradient, a barotropic atmosphere, and a two-layer ocean with an inactive lower layer, the stability of uniform zonal flow to small perturbations was analyzed. The perturbation equations describe the velocity and temperature fields in both the atmospheric and oceanic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8410584144059863722", "cites_id": ["8410584144059863722"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/13/11/1520-0442_2000_013_1831_aoaiim_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=abstract-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qpI4xLdluHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
