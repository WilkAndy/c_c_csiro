In most of the experiments the surface wind stress is set to zero. The surface thermohaline forcing features a strong relaxation of surface temperature and salinity towards observed values. The ocean circulation resulting from the assimilation of surface thermohaline fields depends heavily upon the various parameterizations of vertical mixing processes. Consistent with previous studies, a greater vertical diffusivity results in a greater meridional overturning stream function and a greater meridional heat transport. The vertical structure of stratification is particularly well reproduced if the vertical diffusivity is set to be buoyancy dependent.
