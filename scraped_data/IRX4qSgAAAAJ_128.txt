By strengthening of the Walker circulation, an Atlantic Ni\u00f1o favors a Pacific La Ni\u00f1a, which matures in boreal winter, providing a precursory memory for El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) predictability. How this Atlantic impact responds to greenhouse warming is unclear. Here, we show that greenhouse warming leads to a weakened influence from the Atlantic Ni\u00f1o/Ni\u00f1a on the Pacific ENSO. In response to anomalous equatorial Atlantic heating, ascending over the equatorial Atlantic is weaker due to an increased tropospheric stability in the mean climate, resulting in a weaker impact on the Pacific Ocean. Thus, as greenhouse warming continues, Pacific ENSO is projected to be less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14651141643033419245", "cites_id": ["14651141643033419245"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.aax4111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7Z3wArNPU8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 16, "2022": 13, "2023": 1}}
