El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is spawned in the tropical Pacific, is the most prominent and well-known year-to-year variation on Earth. Its reach is global, and its impacts on society and the environment are legion. Because ENSO is so strong, it can excite other modes of climate variability in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans by altering the general circulation of the atmosphere. However, ocean-atmosphere interactions internal to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are capable of generating distinct modes of climate variability as well. Whether the Atlantic and Indian Oceans can feed back onto Pacific climate has been an ongoing matter of debate. We are now beginning to realize that the tropics, as a whole, are a tightly interconnected system, with strong feedbacks from the Indian and Atlantic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 413, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4441744630458788717", "cites_id": ["4441744630458788717"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aav4236", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bat-QTU_pD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 28, "2020": 89, "2021": 126, "2022": 113, "2023": 53}}
