Both of the parameterizations use a bulk formula: one assumes an atmosphere of infinite heat capacity and the other assumes an atmosphere of no heat capacity. These experiments show that the behavior, the stability, and the response to external perturbations of the oceanic thermohaline circulation depend heavily upon the way in which the heat flux is parameterized and upon the associated thermal capacity of the atmosphere to which the ocean is coupled. With an infinite heat capacity atmosphere the ocean's thermohaline circulation is very sensitive to perturbations in freshwater flux. In contrast, with the alternative scheme the ocean's thermohaline circulation is stable.
