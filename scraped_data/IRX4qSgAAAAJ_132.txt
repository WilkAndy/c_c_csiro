An arbitrary threshold value of boreal winter total rainfall (e.g., 5 mm d\u22121) in the east equatorial Pacific was used by previous studies to capture this feature. Under greenhouse warming, the frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o events is projected to increase, so is the mean east equatorial Pacific rainfall. Is the projected frequency increase a consequence of the mean rainfall increase? We show that the projection is not significantly influenced by the increased mean rainfall. Instead, the increased frequency accounts for approximately 50% of the mean rainfall increase. Using upward atmospheric vertical velocity for defining extreme El Ni\u00f1o reaffirms the conclusion that the increased frequency results from increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16754059524498443812", "cites_id": ["16754059524498443812"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL075635", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JM56515ggugJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 12, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
