Forcing of Antarctic ozone depletion dominated the observed trends during the depletion period (1979\u20132005), but Antarctic ozone is projected to recover by the middle of the 21st century. The recovery provides a mechanism for offsetting the impact from increasing GHG emissions. To what extent will the recovery of ozone mitigate SH atmosphere and ocean circulation trends expected from increasing GHGs? We examine climate model output from the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) emission scenario experiments, submitted to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5.
