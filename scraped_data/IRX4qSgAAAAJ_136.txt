These zonal SPCZ (zSPCZ) events coincided with an El Ni\u00f1o of different magnitude and spatial pattern, in which strong anomalous warming reduced the off\u2010equatorial\u2010to\u2010equatorial meridional sea surface temperature (SST) gradient near the dateline, enabling convection to shift equatorward. It is not known, given the short observational record, how and whether different types of El Ni\u00f1o are associated with zSPCZ events. Using perturbed physics ensembles experiments in which SST biases are reduced, we find that zSPCZ events are concurrent with notable eastern Pacific (EP) warming. Central Pacific warming alone is rarely able to produce a swing, even as the climate warms under a CO2 increase scenario. Only El Ni\u00f1o events with strong EP warming can shift the convective zone.
