We examine contributions by modes of SST variability in the global mean SST based on a new version (version 3) of global sea-ice and SST (GISST3). Besides a trend mode, the dominant modes are El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), interhemispheric oscillation, and North Pacific oscillation. Statistics over the period of 1880\u20131997 show that excluding a warming trend the fluctuation on interannual (IA) and decadal-interdecadal (DID) time scales is dominated by IA ENSO and DID ENSO-like variability. However, the contribution by IA ENSO cycles experiences significant fluctuations, and there appears to be strong modulations by ENSO-like variability on DID or longer time scales: during several decade-long periods, when DID ENSO-like variability raises the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16932774875873285802", "cites_id": ["16932774875873285802"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09307575&AN=16117036&h=Wg%2BBqXoBa1kjTRWBzPb%2BYhOjYrDBTUtswR8HuZfdwRbpXBt72IMHfPBZuAEc%2BeDf4mw0GBXghPDTjsAI1YYJGw%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qhYWMglN_eoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
