Is the simulation of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) relevant to these variations? We demonstrate that inter\u2010model variations of this future warming are consistent with how well models simulate historical IOD properties; models with a stronger IOD amplitude systematically produce a slower eastern IO warming rate with greater future rainfall changes in IOD\u2010affected regions. These models also produce a stronger Bjerknes\u2010like positive feedback, involving sea surface temperatures (SSTs), winds and a shoaling thermocline in the eastern IO. As warming proceeds, models with a stronger positive feedback induce a greater response to warming\u2010induced changes such as easterly trends associated with the Walker circulation, generating a smaller warming in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15959215213551159392", "cites_id": ["15959215213551159392"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010GL046242", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YAi6Ya6Fet0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
