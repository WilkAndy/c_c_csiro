In most existing coupled models that employ flux adjustments, the southern high latitudes, in particular, are still affected by some climate drift. In the CSIRO coupled model, within 100 years following coupling, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) intensifies by about 30 Sv (Sv \u2261 10             6             m             3             s             \u22121             ). This happens despite the use of flux adjustments. Many other model fields such as sea ice, surface albedo, and heat fluxes of the coupled system also experience drift from the precoupled spinup states. It is therefore important to study the processes that give rise to these drifts.           The primary cause of drift in the CSIRO model is due to changes in the pattern of convection in the Southern Ocean relative to the spinup steady state.
