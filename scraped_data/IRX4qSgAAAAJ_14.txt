It was scientifically exciting since, due to the short observational record, our knowledge of an extreme El Ni\u00f1o has been based only on the 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 events. The 2015/2016 El Ni\u00f1o was marked by many environmental disasters that are consistent with what is expected for an extreme El Ni\u00f1o. Considering the dramatic impacts of extreme El Ni\u00f1o, and the risk of a potential increase in frequency of ENSO extremes under greenhouse warming, it is timely to evaluate how the recent event fits into our understanding of ENSO extremes. Here we provide a review of ENSO, its nature and dynamics, and through analysis of various observed key variables, we outline the processes that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 362, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2214361526741844813", "cites_id": ["2214361526741844813"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017RG000560", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TUO9jRP-uh4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 22, "2019": 56, "2020": 79, "2021": 101, "2022": 72, "2023": 29}}
