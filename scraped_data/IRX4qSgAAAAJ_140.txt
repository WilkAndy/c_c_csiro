Unlike the canonical IOD, sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the west central tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) dominated the strong zonal SST gradient as cooling off Sumatra\u2010Java was weak. Over the southeastern TIO, deeper thermocline has suppressed the upwelling cooling since 2012. Such deepened thermocline related to a low\u2010frequency adjustment and curtailed cool anomalies in the 2015 positive IOD but favored warm anomalies in the 2016 negative IOD. Based on statistical analyses, ocean assimilation data confirm that an IOD\u2010like pattern exists in the TIO on decadal timescale. During a negative decadal IOD\u2010like phase, thermocline is deeper in the southeastern TIO; the thermocline\u2010SST feedback is unfavorable for positive IOD occurrence and intensity, but conducive to negative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=126271137865554192", "cites_id": ["126271137865554192"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL076003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EFncTe6awAEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
