Simulation of these relationships in Phase Five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project has not been fully assessed, nor is their impact on the response of ISMR to greenhouse warming. Here we show that the majority of models simulate an unrealistic present-day IOD-ISMR correlation due to an overly strong control by ENSO. As such, a positive IOD is associated with an ISMR reduction in the simulated present-day climate. This unrealistic present-day correlation is relevant to future ISMR projection, inducing an underestimation in the projected ISMR increase. Thus uncertainties in ISMR projection can be in part induced by present-day simulation of ENSO, the IOD, their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14921491880253089983", "cites_id": ["14921491880253089983"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05225-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v2hcwc7JE88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
