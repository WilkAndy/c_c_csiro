It is the strongest year\u2010to\u2010year climate variation on the planet, with environmental and societal consequences felt worldwide. ENSO warm events (El Ni\u00f1o) and cold events (La Ni\u00f1a) are occurring in the context of a global climate system that is rapidly changing through human activities that have raised heat\u2010trapping greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to historically unprecedented levels. As a result, the planet has warmed, and it will continue to warm at a rate dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions. This raises questions about whether climate change has affected the ENSO cycle already, whether it will in the future, and if so, how. Here, we briefly describe ENSO and its impacts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:mKu_rENv82IC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9974275763043248134", "cites_id": ["9974275763043248134"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119548164.ch1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Bij74_W-a4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 13, "2023": 12}}
