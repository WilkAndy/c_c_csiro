A question arises as to whether the heat and salt gain from the south Indian Ocean plays a significant role in determining the thermohaline circulation associated with the NADW formation. Many low-resolution ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) for coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean studies fail to produce an Agulhas leakage. The consequence of this missing leakage in these climate models remains unclear. This study examines the role played by the Agulhas leakage in the compensating process for the NADW outflow, and assesses the feasibility of low-resolution ocean climate models. The authors do this in a series of numerical experiments using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7729796315549843720", "cites_id": ["7729796315549843720"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/25/2/1520-0485_1995_025_0226_cftnoi_2_0_co_2.xml?tab_body=abstract-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CMF4dsvARWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
