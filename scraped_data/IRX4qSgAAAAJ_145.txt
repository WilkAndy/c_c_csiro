Two feedbacks have been suggested as the cause of positive IOD skewness, a positive Bjerknes feedback and a negative SST-cloud-radiation (SCR) feedback, but their relative importance is debated. Using inter-model statistics, we show that the most important process for IOD skewness is an asymmetry in the thermocline feedback, whereby SSTAs respond to thermocline depth anomalies more strongly during the positive phase than negative phase. This asymmetric thermocline feedback drives IOD skewness despite positive IODs receiving greater damping from the SCR feedback. In response to global warming, although the thermocline feedback strengthens, its asymmetry between positive and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11444271289707047720", "cites_id": ["11444271289707047720"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06034", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KKswiBo40p4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
