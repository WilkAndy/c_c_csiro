As a result, under a light microscope, when compared to a model group, the corilagin group showed smaller granulomas, less liver cell denaturation and less inflammatory cell infiltration, and the connective tissues were significantly decreased. By Masson staining, the liver sections from the corilagin group showed less collagen distributed around granulomas, decreased liver fibrosis in the portal tracts and less formed interlobular tissue. The expression of hydroxyproline, IL-13 in liver and GATA3 in spleen in the model group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (P<0.05 or 0.01), while the level of hydroxyproline, IL-13 and GATA3 in the corilagin group were significantly lower than that in the model group (P<0.05).
