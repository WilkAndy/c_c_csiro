However, since the 1980s, El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s influence has been decreasing, accompanied by a strengthening in the IOD\u2019s influence on southern Australia but a reversal in the IOD\u2019s influence on the Indian subcontinent. The dynamics are not fully understood. Here we show that a post-1980 weakening in the ENSO-IOD coherence plays a key role. During the pre-1980 high coherence, ENSO drives both the IOD and regional rainfall, and the IOD\u2019s influence cannot manifest itself. During the post-1980 weak coherence, a positive IOD leads to increased Indian rainfall, offsetting the impact from El Ni\u00f1o. Likewise, the post-1980 weak ENSO-IOD coherence means that El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s pathway for influencing southern Australia cannot fully operate, and as positive IOD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2363497212772326129", "cites_id": ["2363497212772326129"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep31767", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8ZrrUjHUzCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
