This mechanism is independent from the El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and tends to induce the IOD before its canonical peak season. The joint effects of this mechanism and ENSO may explain different lifetimes and strengths of the IOD. During its positive phase, development of sea surface temperature cold anomalies commences in the southern Indian Ocean, accompanied by an anomalous subtropical high system and anomalous southeasterly winds. The eastward movement of these anomalies enhances the monsoon off Sumatra\u2010Java during May\u2013August, leading to an early positive IOD onset. The pressure variability in the subtropical area is related with the Southern Annular Mode, suggesting a teleconnection between high\u2010latitude and midlatitude climate that can further affect the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4382054523869535276", "cites_id": ["4382054523869535276"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088648", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LByjUV8v0DwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
