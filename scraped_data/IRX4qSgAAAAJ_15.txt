Here we analyse the outputs of a series of global warming experiments from the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model. We show that although for the zonal wind stress change the maximum is located at approximately 60\u00b0S, in terms of the change in surface wind stress curl, the maximum is situated at approximately 48\u00b0S. This change in the wind stress curl causes a spin\u2010up of the entire southern midlatitude ocean circulation including a southward strengthening of the subtropical gyres, particularly the East Australia Current (EAC). The intensified EAC generates a warming rate in the Tasman Sea that is the greatest in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) with significant implications for sea level rise \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 360, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11194467370930175525", "cites_id": ["11194467370930175525"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005GL024701", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JX7-VcO8WpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 6, "2007": 21, "2008": 17, "2009": 25, "2010": 19, "2011": 23, "2012": 25, "2013": 28, "2014": 21, "2015": 18, "2016": 29, "2017": 21, "2018": 20, "2019": 16, "2020": 26, "2021": 15, "2022": 18, "2023": 10}}
