This study investigates the sensitivity of rainfall characteristics to resolution in a coupled regional climate model configuration, in particular focusing on processes that modulate the diurnal cycle. Model biases are resolution dependent. Increasing resolution from 3/4\u00b0 to 1/4\u00b0 improves the mean state sea surface temperature and precipitation biases. However, at higher resolutions (1/12\u00b0) rainfall becomes too strong in most areas. Daily maximum rainfall is simulated about 2\u20134 h earlier than in observations over both the land and the ocean, with only small improvements over high topography at higher resolution. We develop a technique to examine cross-coastal processes associated with the rainfall diurnal cycle along all coastlines. This is used to investigate the sensitivity of the diurnal cycle to resolution and to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7135823872815887844", "cites_id": ["7135823872815887844"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3317-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5HXxTgGKB2MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
