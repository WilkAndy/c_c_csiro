The present study addresses how the IOBM and the SAM modulate the impact of ENSO on Australia. The authors show that the modulating effect of the SAM is limited; in particular, the SAM does not modify the ENSO teleconnection pattern. However, the IOBM extends ENSO-induced convection anomalies westward over northern Australia and over the eastern Indian Ocean, whereby extending the ENSO tropical teleconnection to the northwest of Australia. The IOBM also generates an equivalent-barotropic Rossby wave train through convection anomalies over northern Australia. The wave train shares an anomaly center over the Tasman Sea latitudes with the Pacific\u2013South American (PSA) pattern, shifting the anomaly center of the PSA pattern to within a closer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=986434385940907383", "cites_id": ["986434385940907383"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/9/jcli-d-12-00458.1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dwU9ANmEsA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
