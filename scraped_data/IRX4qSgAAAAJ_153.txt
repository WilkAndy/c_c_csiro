The associated dynamics have not been fully explored. Using 20th century climate model experiments, we test if the shoaling thermocline is attributable to a transmission from the Pacific, where a similar shoaling occurs, and whether it is climate change\u2010induced. A 22\u2010model average produces no such signal. An average of a subset of models that better simulate El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its transmission produces the right direction of the IO thermocline trends. The shoaling in this subset average, taken as anthropogenically induced, is far weaker than the observed, suggesting a significant multidecadal variability component in the observed changes. The Pacific contribution increases with a stronger model ENSO amplitude and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13987864429813987265", "cites_id": ["13987864429813987265"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008GL034174", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wXdiiZbgHsIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
