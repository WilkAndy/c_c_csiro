ObjectivesThe goal of SPICE is to observe, simulate, and understand the role of the southwest Pacific Ocean circulation in (a) the large-scale, low-frequency modulation of climate from the Tasman Sea to the equator, and (b) the generation of local climate signatures whose diagnosis will aid regional sustainable development. This goal will be realized through four specific efforts, which are discussed in detail in this Scientific Plan:1. Analysis of the southwest Pacific role in global coupled models; 2. Development of an observational program to survey air-sea fluxes and currents in the Coral, Solomon, and Tasman Seas, and their inflows and outflows, with special attention to the strong boundary currents and jets; 3. Combination of these observations with focused modeling efforts to devise a sustained monitoring program to adequately sample the timevariability of the currents and their heat and mass transports; 4. Using remotely and locally sampled meteorological fields, and the ocean analysis, determination of the air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes and water mass transformations that occur in the region, and their effects on the local and global climate. A focus here may be the design of a process study to observe, model, and understand the South Pacific Convergence Zone."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8302824397515675268", "cites_id": ["8302824397515675268"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/46331/1/111_SPICEscienceplan.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hFZensyOOXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
