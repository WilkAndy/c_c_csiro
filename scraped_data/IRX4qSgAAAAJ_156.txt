To this end, we take 50 years from 19 climate models submitted for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment (AR4) to provide a 950\u2010year realization. Only six models produce a total of nine pIOD\u2010La Ni\u00f1a pairs, with one occurrence of three consecutive pIOD events. The rarity is not due to an overly strong model El Ni\u00f1o\u2010pIOD coherence. Two models produce the 2006\u20132007 sequence of one pIOD with an El Ni\u00f1o followed by a pIOD in a La Ni\u00f1a year, however, no models simulate the observed mechanism. Although the triggering processes vary between models, a commonality is that the trigger resides in the ocean, highlighting the importance of subsurface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8687751358039606047", "cites_id": ["8687751358039606047"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009GL037982", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H0PemNQXkXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
