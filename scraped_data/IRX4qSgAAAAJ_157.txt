Here we investigate this issue using the simulations of the NCAR Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Project focusing on strong El Ni\u00f1o events of the Eastern Pacific (EP) that can be associated to flooding in Northern and Central Peru. It is shown that, in the warmer climate, the duration of strong EP El Ni\u00f1o events peaking in boreal winter is extended by two months, which results in significantly more events peaking in February\u2013March\u2013April (FMA), the season when the climatological Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is at its southernmost location. This larger persistence of strong EP events is interpreted as resulting from both a stronger recharge process and a more effective thermocline feedback in the eastern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17203561619714803872", "cites_id": ["17203561619714803872"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-019-05036-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oAilDiVUv-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
