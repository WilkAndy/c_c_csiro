No matter the different appeance, they are based on the same dynamical sophistication: geostrophy, hydrostatic, and potential density (\u03f1) conservation (Davis, 1978). The current inverse methods are all based on two conservation principles: potential density and potential vorticity (q=f\u2202\u03f1/\u2202z) and require \u03b2-turning. Thus, two necessary conditions can be incorporated into any inverse methods: (1) non-coincidence of potential density and potential vorticity surfaces and (2) existence of vertical turning of the velocity (\u03b2-turning). This can be done using the P-Vector, a unit vector in the direction of \u25bd\u03f1\u00d7\u25bdq (Chu, 1994, 1995). The first necessary condition becomes the existence of the P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15748047913107145330", "cites_id": ["15748047913107145330"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02751694", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ckKV5iNOjNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
