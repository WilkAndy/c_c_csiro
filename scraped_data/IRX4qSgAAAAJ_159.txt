In summer, upwelling is known to occur and this is concentrated on the Xiamen-Shantou coast, rather than along the length of the Strait. This feature is readily reproduced by the model and the concentration is shown to be dependent upon the bottom topography. The winter condition is more complex because the upwelling is observed to occur in mid-shelf. This feature is only reproduced when the Kuroshio Current is introduced into the model, travelling north-eastwards in opposition to the seasonal wind, and interacting with the bottom topography. Given a north-east monsoon wind averaging 7 m s\u22121, considered appropriate for the Strait, a Kuroshio Current of minimum strength of one knot is required to reproduce the mid-shelf upwelling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14095060377353010882", "cites_id": ["14095060377353010882"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272771488900091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wj7P_7u2m8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
