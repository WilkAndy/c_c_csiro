ENSO exerts its impacts on remote regions of the globe through atmospheric teleconnections, affecting extreme weather events worldwide. However, these teleconnections are inherently nonlinear and sensitive to ENSO SST anomaly patterns and amplitudes. In addition, teleconnections are modulated by variability in the oceanic and atmopsheric mean state outside the tropics and by land and sea ice extent. The character of ENSO as well as the ocean mean state have changed since the 1990s, which might be due to either natural variability or anthropogenic forcing, or their combined influences. This has resulted in changes in ENSO atmospheric teleconnections in terms of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 321, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8652480933120818705", "cites_id": ["8652480933120818705"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017rg000568", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Eb6B3JDJE3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 11, "2019": 50, "2020": 69, "2021": 74, "2022": 80, "2023": 32}}
