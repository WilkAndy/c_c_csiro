Most of this decrease occurs at the 26.8\u201326.9 kg m\u22123 density range which forms southwest of Australia, while a slight volume increase occurs at 26.6\u201326.8 kg m\u22123. Further analysis indicates that the weakening of the Mascarene High and westerly winds in the SIO reduces the evaporation\u2010precipitation, surface heat flux, and Ekman pumping and shoals the mixed layer southwest of Australia, which leads to a volume decrease at 26.8\u201326.9 kg m\u22123 in approximately 3 years. West of 90\u00b0E, the parameters exhibit the opposite change, leading to a volume increase at 26.6\u201326.8 kg m\u22123. This result suggests that surface winds play an important role in the variability of the SIO SAMW volume during the Argo \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9965730217418180913", "cites_id": ["9965730217418180913"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020gl087830", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MUmWANViTYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
