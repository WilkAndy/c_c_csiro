Studies have suggested that the cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific may be partly induced by warming in the North Atlantic. However, it remains unknown how stable this inter-tropical teleconnection will be under global warming. Here we show that the inter-tropical teleconnection from the tropical Atlantic to Pacific weakens substantially as the CO 2 concentration increases. This reduced impact is related to the El Ni\u00f1o-like warming of the tropical Pacific mean state, which leads to limited seasonal migration of the Pacific inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and weakened ocean heat transport. A fast decay of the tropical Atlantic SST anomalies in a warmer climate also contributes to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12329668498076729343", "cites_id": ["12329668498076729343"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/srep20078.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:__8vcizIG6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
