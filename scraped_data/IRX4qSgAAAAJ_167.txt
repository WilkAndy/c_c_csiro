Positive blocking events occurring at 130\u00b0\u2013140\u00b0E increase the likelihood of cutoff low pressure systems developing that generate significant rainfall totals across SEA. In mid to late austral autumn (April\u2013May), blocking is coherent with negative IOD events. During this season, a negative IOD event and blocking are associated with warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean and a blocking high pressure cell south of Australia. An anomalous cyclonic pressure center over southern Australia directs tropical moisture flux anomalies to the region. Despite this, only a small portion of a negative IOD's impact on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16344837544614240774", "cites_id": ["16344837544614240774"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/19/jcli-d-12-00781.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BiIz7iWH1OIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
