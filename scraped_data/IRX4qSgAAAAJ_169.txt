Modulated by El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation, NTA warm anomalies tend to induce La Ni\u00f1a events, droughts in Northeast Brazil, increased frequency of extreme hurricanes, and phytoplankton blooms in the Guinea Dome. Future changes of NTA variability could have profound socioeconomic impacts yet remain unknown. Here, we reveal a robust intensification of NTA variability under greenhouse warming. This intensification mainly arises from strengthening of ENSO-forced Pacific-North American pattern and tropospheric temperature anomalies, as a consequence of an eastward shift of ENSO-induced equatorial Pacific convection and of increased ENSO variability, which enhances ENSO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5208088535496502668", "cites_id": ["5208088535496502668"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.abg9690", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jK0N7e3YRkgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
