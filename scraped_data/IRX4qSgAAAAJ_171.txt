However, questions remain as to the robustness of strong El Ni\u00f1o events in forcing regional climate variability. The strong 1982, 1997 and 2015 El Ni\u00f1o events were of similar type and strength, but in eastern Australia they were associated with differing spring rainfall anomaly magnitudes and patterns. To understand these differences, we first determined the most important processes for teleconnecting the El Ni\u00f1o signal to east Australian spring rainfall using historical relationships with winds and sea level pressure. Then, using a 60-member atmospheric model ensemble, we estimated the influence of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on Australian atmospheric circulation and rainfall during these three El Ni\u00f1o events relative to internal variability. We found that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=547303009951479085", "cites_id": ["547303009951479085"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-019-04732-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LfWoFDBpmAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
