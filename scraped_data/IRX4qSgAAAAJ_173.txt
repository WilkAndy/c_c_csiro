It is divided into two parts: the first part describing how the assessment system is constructed with a set of results describing the driest, median and wettest scenarios based on the range of available climate scenarios. The second part describes a risk assessment, where techniques developed by CSIRO are applied to assess the most likely outcomes based on the range of regional climate change assessed from a suite of climate models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14419167633681422148", "cites_id": ["14419167633681422148"], "pub_url": "https://vises.org.au/documents/2005-Cai-et-al-Climage-change-in-QLD.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RBdkGpEsG8gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
