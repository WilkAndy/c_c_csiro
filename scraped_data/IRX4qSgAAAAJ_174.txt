Although an El Ni\u00f1o typically induces a positive SC rainfall anomaly during these months, the unprecedented rainfall increase cannot be explained by the strong El Ni\u00f1o of 2015/2016, and the dynamics is unclear. Here we show that a nonlinear meridional moisture advection contributes substantially to the unprecedented rainfall increase. During cooler months of 2015, the meridional flow anomaly over the South China Sea region, which acts on an El Ni\u00f1o\u2010induced anomalous meridional moisture gradient, is particularly large and is supported by an anomalous zonal sea surface temperature gradient over the northwestern Pacific, which recorded its largest value in 2015 since 1950. Our study highlights, for the first time, the importance of the nonlinear process \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15473766148696919826", "cites_id": ["15473766148696919826"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL077446", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ek-LJlTcvdYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
