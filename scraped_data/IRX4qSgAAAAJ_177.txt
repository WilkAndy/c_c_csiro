Severe particulate pollution days, with daily mean PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 150\u2009\u03bcg\u2009m\u22123, occurred frequently in North China, especially during the boreal winters of 2013\u20132019. Severe particulate pollution generally occurs under conducive weather patterns characterized by a stable atmosphere with weak winds, under which air pollutants emitted at the surface by human activities would accumulate. The occurrence of conducive weather patterns has been attributed to variations in numerous climate factors such as Arctic sea-ice cover, sea surface temperature and atmospheric teleconnections, but the dominant climate drivers remain unclear. Here, we show that the East Atlantic\u2013West Russia teleconnection pattern and the Victoria mode of sea surface temperature anomalies are the top two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18059263498768083880", "cites_id": ["18059263498768083880"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00933-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qOs_VXhkn_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 11}}
