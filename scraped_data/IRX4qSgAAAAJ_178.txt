The pIOD displays strong inter\u2010event differences, ranging from an extreme event dominated by westward\u2010extended strong cold anomalies along the equator, to a moderate event with weakened cooling confined to region off Sumatra\u2010Java. Representation of the extreme pIOD varies vastly across ocean temperature products. Here we show that products generated in a system explicitly involving subsurface oceanic processes capture the nonlinear dynamics of the extreme pIOD, i.e., the equatorial nonlinear zonal and vertical advection, and systematically produce a more realistic extreme pIOD. Thus, our study identifies ocean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4390699140228567264", "cites_id": ["4390699140228567264"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL089396", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4NDv6Jrl7jwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
