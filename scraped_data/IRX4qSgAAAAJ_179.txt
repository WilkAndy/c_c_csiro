Model simulations suggest that anthropogenic aerosols can also force circulation changes, including delaying the weakening of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, altering the interhemispheric sea surface temperature gradient, and inducing a pan\u2010oceanic heat redistribution. The extent to which aerosols from different regions contribute to these oceanic changes is currently unknown. Using specifically designed 20th century coupled climate model experiments that separate Asian and non\u2010Asian aerosol impacts, it is shown that the non\u2010Asian aerosol component, predominantly sulfate aerosols, accounts for much of the simulated aerosol\u2010induced oceanic changes. These include delaying the weakening of the global \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12861871080287586330", "cites_id": ["12861871080287586330"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/grl.50587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GkhpN5qLfrIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
