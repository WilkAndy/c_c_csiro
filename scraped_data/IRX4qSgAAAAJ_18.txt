Indeed, throughout SA, precipitation and temperature exhibit a substantial, yet regionally diverse, relationship with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). For example, El Ni\u00f1o is typically accompanied by drought in the Amazon and north-eastern SA, but flooding in the tropical west coast and south-eastern SA, with marked socio-economic effects. In this Review, we synthesize the understanding of ENSO teleconnections to SA. Recent efforts have sought improved understanding of ocean\u2013atmosphere processes that govern the impact, inter-event and decadal variability, and responses to anthropogenic warming. ENSO\u2019s impacts have been found to vary markedly, affected not only by ENSO diversity, but also by modes of variability within \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:1yWc8FF-_SYC", "num_citations": 307, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4301688859990549485", "cites_id": ["4301688859990549485"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0040-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7eP9ETqrsjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 26, "2021": 97, "2022": 131, "2023": 48}}
