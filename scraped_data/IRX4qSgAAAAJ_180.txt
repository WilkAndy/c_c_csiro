However, an asymmetry exists in the relationship between SST and heat content: positive SST anomalies related to El Ni\u00f1o are stronger than negative SST anomalies related to La Ni\u00f1a for the same magnitude (but opposite sign) heat content anomaly. In this study, we analyse a multi\u2010century simulation using the CSIRO Mark 3 coupled climate model to show that a similar asymmetry exists in some decades but not in others. This non\u2010stationarity appears to be a consequence of modulations by a mode of multidecadal variability which affects the temperature of upwelled water and the efficiency with which upwelling generates SST anomalies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7043001766810545037", "cites_id": ["7043001766810545037"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003GL018714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jeswn8rEvWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
