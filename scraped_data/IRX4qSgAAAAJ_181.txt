The imposed freshening lasts for 5 yr with a total salt deficit equivalent to about eight times the observed Great Salinity Anomaly during the late 1960s and early 1970s.The thermohaline circulation associated with North Atlantic Deep Water Formation (NADWF) initially weakens, but it recovers within 20 yr of the imposed freshening being removed. The effect of the weakened NADWF is gradually transmitted from high latitudes to the entire Atlantic Ocean. The response at the equator lags that at 62\u00b0N by about 10 yr. In the midlatitude (from 30\u00b0 to 58\u00b0N) region, the lag causes a warming during the initial weakening and a cooling during the recovery. Changes in the thermohaline circulation significantly modify the large-scale North Atlantic circulation.
