Initially, the thermal forcing condition is that proposed by Haney, that is, restoring the model surface temperature to a climatology. The restoring condition represents a strong damping. When a steady state is reached, the thermal damping is switched to a weaker one, but the atmosphere-ocean heat exchange is adjusted so that at the moment of the switch the heat flux is identical to that prior to the switch. It is found that interdecadal oscillations and climate drift occur as a result of the switch, regardless of the forcing condition for salinity. The cause for the variability and drift can be traced to the spinup. During the spinup, the surface climatology of the model ocean is forcefully \u201cnudged\u201d toward that of the climatology, regardless of whether or not the internal dynamics of the model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6889014730181805633", "cites_id": ["6889014730181805633"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/9/11/1520-0442_1996_009_2821_ocdaio_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QYbrxGWyml8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
