How the precursory NPMM forcing on ENSO responds to greenhouse warming remains unknown. Here, using climate model ensembles under high-emissions warming scenarios, we find an enhanced future impact on ENSO by the NPMM. This is manifested by increased sensitivity of boreal-winter equatorial Pacific winds and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to the NPMM three seasons before. The enhanced NPMM impact translates into an increased frequency of NPMM that leads to an extreme El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a. Under greenhouse warming, higher background SSTs cause a nonlinear evaporation\u2013SST relationship to more effectively induce surface wind anomalies in the equatorial western Pacific, conducive to ENSO \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7183488188257943789", "cites_id": ["7183488188257943789"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01139-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7UBUjXLgsGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
