Understanding the response of the IOD to a warmer climate has been largely limited to studies of individual coupled general circulation models or multi-model ensembles. This has provided valuable insight into the IOD\u2019s projected response to increasing greenhouse gases but has limitations in accounting for the role of internal climate variability. Using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), the IOD is examined in thirty-five present-day and future simulations to determine how internal variability influences properties of the IOD and their response to a warmer climate. Despite small perturbations in the initial conditions as the only difference between ensemble members \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12467607001797584627", "cites_id": ["12467607001797584627"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31842-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:82ZRDYPWBa0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 3}}
