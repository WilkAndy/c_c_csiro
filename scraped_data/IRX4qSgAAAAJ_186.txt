Are these oceanic responses manifested in the SH atmospheric circulation? We demonstrate that as a result of the poleward shift, maximum sea surface temperature (SST) gradients, midlatitude storms and the westerly jet shift southward, intensifying the trend of the southern annular mode (SAM). Because the response of the atmospheric circulation to the underlying oceanic anomalies is equivalent barotropic, a poleward shift and intensification in zonal wind and vertical velocities are generated from the atmosphere\u2010ocean interface to the middle troposphere. These atmospheric circulation responses, in turn, reinforce the ocean circulation changes.
