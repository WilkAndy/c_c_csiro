In one scenario, denoted IS92a, the atmospheric CO2 increases such that it reaches doubling after 128 years. In the other, the CO2 increases at 1% per year compounding (doubling after 70\u2005y). As the CO2 increases in both scenarios, the top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation increases giving enhanced cooling of the coupled system, while the outgoing short wave radiation decreases contributing to a warming of the system. The latter overcompensates the former leading to a global mean net radiative heat gain. The distribution of this heat gain produces the well-known interhemispheric asymmetry in warming, despite a decrease in the sea ice around Antarctica in this model. It is found that the volume \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18326642652489977298", "cites_id": ["18326642652489977298"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003820050237", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0g0wy2RQVf4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
