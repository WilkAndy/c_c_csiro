Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) cover ~22% of the global ocean but account for 95% of global fisheries catches. Yet how climate change affects MHWs over LMEs remains unknown because such LMEs are confined to the coast where low-resolution climate models are known to have biases. Here, using a high-resolution Earth system model and applying a \u2018future threshold\u2019 that considers MHWs as anomalous warming above the long-term mean warming of sea surface temperatures, we find that future intensity and annual days of MHWs over the majority of the LMEs remain higher than in the present-day climate. Better resolution of ocean mesoscale eddies enables simulation of more realistic MHWs than low-resolution models. These increases in MHWs under global warming pose a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=813830399482387715", "cites_id": ["813830399482387715"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01266-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:A92PvG9OSwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 10}}
