On the one hand, it represents the product of a complex interaction between the atmosphere and ocean on a rotating earth, and, on the other, it has great practical implications in both climate modification and in its ability to inject nutrients into the surface layers. The latter feature is particularly true of limited sections of the southern coastal zone of Australia. For the greater part of each year this vast zone experiences a persistent west to east current, trapped on the shelf in the characteristic southern hemisphere downwelling condition.                      1                    It is not surprising then, that the coastal waters of much of this region have often been termed a biological desert. This unfavorable condition seems to be relieved intermittently during the summer period, when the latitudinal shift of zonal barometric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9271173728873484541", "cites_id": ["9271173728873484541"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351074698-5/layered-models-coastal-upwelling-case-study-south-australian-region-cai-wenju-schahinger-lennon", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_RBwuGLTqYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1}}
