However, SEA experienced near average rainfall during the similar El Ni\u00f1o of 1997\u20131998. Using an ensemble of atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) forced with observed SSTs, we demonstrate that the different September\u2013November rainfall during the 1982 and 1997 events is primarily explained by differences in SST forcing from outside the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. The AGCMs reproduce an observed relationship between SEA rainfall and SSTs to the northeast of Australia. Significantly, cooler northeast Australian SSTs during 1982\u20131983 shifted the rainfall distribution, making a rainfall deficit more likely (relative to the situation in 1997\u20131998). However, stochastic atmospheric processes can modulate the El Ni\u00f1o and regional SST influence, and the use of an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2619803590144754246", "cites_id": ["2619803590144754246"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL066319", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RgLfI3xpWyQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
