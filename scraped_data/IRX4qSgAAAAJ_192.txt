These extreme pIODs are characterised by a westward extension of cold sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) which push the downstream atmospheric convergence further west. This induces severe drought and flooding in the surrounding countries, but the processes involved in this projected increase have not been fully examined. Here we conduct a detailed heat budget analysis of 19 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and show that nonlinear zonal and vertical heat advection are important for reinforcing extreme pIODs. Under greenhouse warming, these nonlinear processes do not change significantly in amplitude, but the frequency of occurrences surpassing a threshold increases. This is due to the projected weakening of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8442115886175509710", "cites_id": ["8442115886175509710"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zlwslKtrKHUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
