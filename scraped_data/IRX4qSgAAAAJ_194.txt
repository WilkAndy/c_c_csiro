A switch from Haney BCs to mixed BCs often causes the model North Atlantic Deep Water Formation (NADWF) to either collapse or intensify. Recently, Tziperman et al. found that the collapse was due to an unrealistic freshwater flux field diagnosed from a spinup using a too short relaxation timescale for salinity. They replaced the unrealistic freshwater flux with a more realistic freshwater flux diagnosed from a spinup using a longer relaxation timescale for salinity and found that NADWF stabilized. In this study, the author shows that mixed BCs are not suitable for studying the stability of the present ocean climate, regardless whether a realistic freshwater flux is realistic or not.
