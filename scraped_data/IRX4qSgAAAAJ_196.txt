The 1982/83 and 1997/98 \u201csuper\u2013El Ni\u00f1o\u201d events pose a challenge to this understanding. The 1997/98 event was dubbed \u201cthe climate event of the twentieth century\u201d for its extraordinary magnitude and global-scale destructive effects. Modeling studies over the last 2 years have led to further insights into extreme El Ni\u00f1os and have found that their frequency is projected to increase significantly under greenhouse warming.In boreal spring of 2014, the tropical Pacific was primed for an El Ni\u00f1o, when most forecast agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology elevated their El Ni\u00f1o probability to more than 60%. A remarkable increase in warm water volume with a series of westerly wind bursts in boreal spring alerted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15611264588130508748", "cites_id": ["15611264588130508748"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26225047", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zF8nTm5aptgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
