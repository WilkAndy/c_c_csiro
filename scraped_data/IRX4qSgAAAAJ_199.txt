However, its projected warming is highly uncertain and varies substantially across climate models. Here, using outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six models, we show that Southern Ocean warming during the twenty-first century is linked to the change in amplitude of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Models simulating a larger increase in ENSO amplitude systematically produce a slower Southern Ocean warming; conversely, a smaller increase in ENSO amplitude sees a stronger warming. The asymmetry in amplitude and teleconnection between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a produce cumulative surface wind anomalies over the southern high latitudes, impacting Southern Ocean heat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13382318709600043402", "cites_id": ["13382318709600043402"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01398-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ikHGvPaLt7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 12}}
