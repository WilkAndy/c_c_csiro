Here we examine the relative importance of rising temperature and decreasing rainfall over its catchment, the Murray Darling Basin (MDB). Although annual\u2010total inflow is more sensitive to rainfall over the southern MDB, where rainfall since 2001, has been the lowest on record, this alone can not explain the observed inflow decline. A relationship exists between inflow variations and fluctuations of temperature not associated with rainfall in the austral winter and spring: a rise of 1\u00b0C leads to an approximate 15% reduction in the climatological annual inflow. Our results provide strong evidence that rising temperatures due to the enhanced greenhouse effect have a strong impact on southern Australia's water resources, in addition to any reduction in rainfall, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 260, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13712921080459157248", "cites_id": ["13712921080459157248"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008GL033390", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AN-7iREVTr4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 29, "2010": 25, "2011": 36, "2012": 24, "2013": 26, "2014": 13, "2015": 16, "2016": 17, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 15, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
