Establishment of atmospheric convection in the climatologically cold and dry EP region provides a major source of the nonlinearity, but its role in the relationship between CP\u2010 and EP\u2010ENSO variability and their long\u2010term change remain unclear. By constructing a nonlinear two\u2010box recharge\u2010oscillator model, here we show that nonlinear atmospheric convection operates to boost strong EP El Ni\u00f1o, strong CP La Ni\u00f1a, and evolution in tandem of variability and skewness of CP\u2010 and EP\u2010ENSO. Further, the observed coherent long\u2010term increase in frequency of strong EP El Ni\u00f1o, strong CP La Ni\u00f1a, and variability of the two\u2010type ENSO over the past decades is facilitated by a corresponding increase in the nonlinear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=263664563746680772", "cites_id": ["263664563746680772"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088784", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xK_6FYa5qAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
