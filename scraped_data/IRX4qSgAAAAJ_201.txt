It features a sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly gradient, 12 defined by the dipole mode index (DMI), the difference of area-averaged SST anomaly between 13 the western tropical IO (50 E-70 E, 10 N-10 S) and the southeastern tropical IO (90 E-110 E, 14 Eq.-10 S). The IOD event tends to develop and mature in the boreal summer and fall seasons. 15 When a positive IOD (pIOD) occurs, SST warms up in the west and cools down in the east, which 16 sets up an east-west pressure gradient. The atmosphere hence responds to the anomalous SST 17 gradient. Anomalous easterly winds prevail along the equator driven by the zonal pressure 18 gradient, causing low sea level anomaly (SLA) in the eastern tropical IO. Rainless weather 19 dominates over the Maritime Continent due to a weakened convection (Fig. 1a). Anomalies of an 20 opposing polarity are generated during a negative IOD event. 21 The IOD has profound impacts on regional climate. It could change the summer monsoon 22 rainfall in China, which affects millions of people [3]. For example, during a pIOD, the summer 23 rainfall is enhanced in southern China but weakened in northern China. Therefore, to reduce 24 damage from flood and drought, it is important to understand mechanisms behind the IOD. 25 In year 2017, the DMI was above one standard deviation from April to August (Figs. 1b-c), 26\u00a9 2018 published by Elsevier.
