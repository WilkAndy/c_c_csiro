To a large extent, the synergy affects the effectiveness of anthropogenic emission control, thereby reshaping the O3-NOx-VOC empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA) diagram. Focusing on the ozone pollution period of June 2017 in the North China Plain, we design almost 500 numerical experiments using regional air quality model Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) that revealed an interesting synergic effect, defined as the contribution of biogenic emissions to ozone concentrations concomitant with a reduction in anthropogenic emissions. A quasi-EKMA diagram is constructed to delineate the contribution of biogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5621117893481869047", "cites_id": ["5621117893481869047"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972106798X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9y6UMfE4Ak4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
