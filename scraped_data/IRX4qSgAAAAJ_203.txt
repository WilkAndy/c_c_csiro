Determining the time of emergence of climate change signals from the natural variability is critical for mitigation strategies and adaptation planning. Here, using a multimodel ensemble, we find that the annual-mean sea surface temperature (SST) signal has already emerged across much of the tropical Pacific, appearing last in the east. The signal of a wetter annual-mean rainfall in the east is expected to emerge by mid-century, with some sensitivity to emission scenario. However, the ENSO-related rainfall variability signal is projected to emerge by about 2040 regardless of emission scenario, about 30\u2009years earlier than ENSO-related SST variability signal at about 2070. Our results are instructive for the detection of climate change signals and reinforce the rapidly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15351133617433737532", "cites_id": ["15351133617433737532"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01301-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PPmx9rAuCtUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 7}}
