Establishment of atmospheric convection leads to a nonlinear response of zonal winds to SST, but its relative importance to nonlinear oceanic feedbacks remains unclear. Using a recharge oscillator model modified to incorporate various nonlinearities estimated from observations, we show that the nonlinear wind response to SST alone can induce a nonlinear response of the thermocline to winds and that of SST to the thermocline, as winds affect the growth of SST and damping of thermocline anomalies through the recharge/discharge process. Oceanic nonlinear feedbacks enhance the simulated ENSO asymmetries only when the nonlinear atmospheric feedback is present \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3295777554598546728", "cites_id": ["3295777554598546728"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KE2NYDn0vC0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
