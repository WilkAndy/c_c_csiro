During the period of increasing greenhouse forcing, the ocean mixed layer warms rapidly. After the forcing stabilizes, the deeper ocean continues to warm the surface (the slow response). We show that ENSO rainfall variability over the tropical Pacific intensifies in both periods but the rate of increase per degree global mean surface temperature (GMST) warming is larger for the slow response because of greater relative warming in the base state as the mean upwelling changes from a damping to a driver of the surface warming. Our results have important implications for climate extremes under GMST stabilization that the Paris Agreement calls for. To stabilize GMST, the fast surface cooling offsets the slow warming from the prior greenhouse gas increase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14132856526729862726", "cites_id": ["14132856526729862726"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL081414", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Rl5LySH-IcQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
