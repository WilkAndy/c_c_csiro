The three climate scenarios are historical climate, recent climate, and future climate. The climate scenarios have 77 years of daily climate data at 0.05 x 0.05 (~ 5 km x 5 km) resolution grid cells across northern Australia. This report documents the data sources and methods implemented to develop the three climate scenarios, being historical climate (Scenario A), recent climate (Scenario B), and future climate (Scenario C). It also provides key climate characteristics of the three scenarios that allow water resource managers to better understand the current and projected climate of the systems they manage. The historical climate scenario (Scenario A) is the baseline against which other scenarios are compared. Scenario A is a 77-year record of daily rainfall and evapotranspiration data from 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8240548537412539039", "cites_id": ["8240548537412539039"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP113200&sb=RECENT&n=4&rpp=10&page=44&tr=5675&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n9LWBjxPXHIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
