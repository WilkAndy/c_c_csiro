The current classification of El Ni\u00f1o does not distinguish the strong from the moderate El Ni\u00f1o events, making it difficult to project future change of El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s intensity. Here we classify 33 El Ni\u00f1o events from 1901 to 2017 by cluster analysis of the onset and amplification processes, and the resultant 4 types of El Ni\u00f1o distinguish the strong from the moderate events and the onset from successive events. The 3 categories of El Ni\u00f1o onset exhibit distinct development mechanisms. We find El Ni\u00f1o onset regime has changed from eastern Pacific origin to western Pacific origin with more frequent occurrence of extreme events since the 1970s. This regime change is hypothesized to arise from a background warming in the western Pacific and the associated increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 250, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3168546574039620829", "cites_id": ["3168546574039620829"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1911130116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3ZzpR1Lw-CsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 44, "2021": 87, "2022": 81, "2023": 31}}
