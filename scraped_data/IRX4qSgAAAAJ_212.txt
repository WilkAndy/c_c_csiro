Such positive WPSH anomalies can be induced by central Pacific (CP) cold sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies of an incipient La Ni\u00f1a and warm anomalies in the Indian and/or the tropical Atlantic Ocean, both promoting anticyclonic anomalies over the northwestern Pacific region. How variability of the WPSH, its extremity, and the associated mechanisms might respond to greenhouse warming remains elusive. Using outputs from 32 of the latest climate models, here we show an increase in WPSH variability translating into a 73% increase in frequency of strong WPSH events under a business-as-usual emission scenario, supported by a strong intermodel \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4940238188564817479", "cites_id": ["4940238188564817479"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2120335119", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R6Y5P3VAj0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 8}}
