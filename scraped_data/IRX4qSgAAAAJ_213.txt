These events are generally attributed to the instability of basin-scale air\u2013sea interactions in the equatorial Pacific. However, the role of sub-basin-scale processes in the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation life cycle remains unknown due to the scarcity of observations and coarse resolution of climate models. Here, using a long-term high-resolution global climate simulation, we find that equatorial ocean eddies with horizontal wavelengths less than several hundred kilometres substantially inhibit the growth of La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o events. These submesoscale eddies are regulated by the intensity of Pacific cold-tongue temperature fronts. The eddies generate an anomalous surface cooling tendency during El Ni\u00f1o by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6765888275873337875", "cites_id": ["6765888275873337875"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00890-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ExJpKYpD5V0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
