Though many studies investigated ocean\u2010atmosphere couplings responsible for its large magnitude, the dynamics that govern the unique structure of the event remain elusive. Here we show that a local ocean\u2010atmosphere feedback among convection\u2010induced surface winds, oceanic upwelling and sea surface temperature in the far\u2010eastern Pacific, resulted in a boreal summer cooling tendency along the South American coast. It canceled warming in the far\u2010eastern equatorial Pacific that would otherwise develop, leading to the distinctive anomaly pattern of the 2015/2016 El Ni\u00f1o. These processes were initially triggered by the leftover anomalous warm sea surface temperature and positive moist static energy over the northeastern tropical Pacific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=616930416121895059", "cites_id": ["616930416121895059"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019gl085681", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k1gU4PHGjwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
