This cooling has been previously attributed to an anthropogenic aerosol-induced strengthening of the global ocean conveyor, which transfers heat from the subtropical gyre latitudes toward the North Atlantic. From the mid-1990s the sub-thermocline southern Indian Ocean experienced a rapid temperature trend reversal. Here we show, using climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, that the late twentieth century sub-thermocline cooling of the southern Indian Ocean was primarily driven by increasing anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases. The models simulate a slow-down in the sub-thermocline cooling followed by a rapid warming towards the mid twenty-first century. The simulated evolution of the Indian Ocean temperature trend is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11718152126165969384", "cites_id": ["11718152126165969384"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02245", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Gkc-EU9n6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
