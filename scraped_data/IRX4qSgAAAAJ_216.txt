The transit in the Coral Sea is potentially of great importance to tropical climate prediction because changes in either the temperature or the amount of water arriving at the equator have the capability to modulate El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle and thereby produce basin-scale climate feedbacks. The southern fate of thermocline waters is, comparably, of major in uence on Australia and New Zealand\u2019s climate; its seasonal and interannual evolution in uences air-sea heat ux and atmospheric conditions, and it participates in the combined South Indian and Pacific Ocean \u201csupergyre.\u201d Substantial changes in this circulation have been observed over the past 50 years and continue in global climate projections. The subtropical gyre has been spinning up in recent years with possible consequences for ENSO modulation and for the East Australian Current (EAC), whose in uence has moved south, dramatically affecting the climate and biodiversity of Tasmania. Despite its apparent importance to the climate system, few observations are available to diagnose the processes and pathways of transport through the complicated geography of the southwest Pacific. The South Pacific Convergence Zone is poorly documented; the region is remote, and the large temporal variability and strong narrow currents in complex bathymetry pose serious challenges to an observing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11480226171389216104", "cites_id": ["11480226171389216104"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/65402/1/133_SPICEscience_imp_plan.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aAXMxuD0UZ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
