The complex processes that govern ENSO and its impacts have generated intense research over the past decades, reviewed in previous chapters: a better understanding of how ENSO responds to anthropogenic climate change requires effort in resolving how ENSO responds to and interacts with a multitude of factors such as weather\u2010scale phenomena, volcanic eruptions, orbital forcing, etc. This chapter highlights some key unresolved issues in ENSO, supplemented by analysis of paleoclimate data and past and future state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art climate model simulations. First, paleo\u2010ENSO reconstructions indicate a weakening of ENSO variability accompanying a weaker seasonal cycle, albeit lacking a clear orbital signal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9919601906993678244", "cites_id": ["9919601906993678244"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119548164.ch21", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pEely2CBqYkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
