One protruding feature of the WPO is the warm pool, the world\u2019s warmest open ocean surface water spanning the northern and southern tropical WPO. The warm pool modulates global and regional climate systems, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Asian and Australian monsoon. The other feature is the Western Boundary Current (WBC) system, which consists of the Kuroshio and the East Australian Current, and, uniquely, two equatorward low-latitude WBCs, the Mindanao Current in the North Pacific, and Gulf of Papua Current/New Guinea Coastal Current system in the South. These two features are closely linked; a recharge or discharge of the warm pool triggers a response of the WBCs, and variability of the WBCs in turn modulates the evolution of the warm pool."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12690386646950903748", "cites_id": ["12690386646950903748"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janet-Sprintall/publication/274967821_Introduction_to_special_section_on_Western_Pacific_Ocean_Circulation_and_Climate_Introduction_to_WPOCC_SS/links/5a8b5dfba6fdcc6b1a43d30e/Introduction-to-special-section-on-Western-Pacific-Ocean-Circulation-and-Climate-Introduction-to-WPOCC-SS.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xH_eOWtPHbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
