However, the causes of this polar amplification are still debated. Some studies highlight the importance of surface-albedo feedback\u2013, while others find larger contributions from longwave feedbacks,,, with changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat transport also thought to play a role\u2013. Here, we determine the causes of polar amplification using climate model simulations in which CO2 forcing is prescribed in distinct geographical regions, with the linear sum of climate responses to regional forcings replicating the response to global forcing. The degree of polar amplification depends strongly on the location of CO2 forcing. In particular, polar amplification is found to be dominated by forcing in the polar regions, specifically through positive local lapse-rate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 247, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3864343796993553358", "cites_id": ["3864343796993553358"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0339-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zvPIjTXooDUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 21, "2020": 49, "2021": 77, "2022": 69, "2023": 27}}
