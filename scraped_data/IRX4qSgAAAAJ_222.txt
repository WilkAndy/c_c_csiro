Understanding the eastern Pacific (EP) and central Pacific (CP) El Ni\u00f1o response to a warmer climate is paramount, yet the role of internal climate variability in modulating their response is not clear. Using large ensembles, we find that internal variability generates a spread in the standard deviation and skewness of these two El Ni\u00f1o types that is similar to the spread of 17 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that realistically simulate ENSO diversity. Based on 40 Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) and 99 Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) members, unforced variability can explain more than 90% of the historical EP and CP El Ni\u00f1o standard deviation and all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:VN7nJs4JPk0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3972590328693151231", "cites_id": ["3972590328693151231"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/6/JCLI-D-20-0232.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_1XoM9t5ITcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
