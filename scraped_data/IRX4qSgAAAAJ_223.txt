Given the cooling effect associated with increasing anthropogenic aerosols and natural forcing (i.e., volcanic aerosols), we examine their respective roles in the simulated global OHC trend and the associated ocean temperature structure, using targeted experiments from two models, designed to separate the individual impacts of these forcing components. We show that it is more likely that the indirect effect of aerosols, not volcanic aerosols alone, is the reason for the bulk of weaker modelled OHC trends. Further, anthropogenic aerosols are essential for simulating the structure of the observed temperature changes, including a concentrated cooling in the Southern Hemisphere subtropical latitudes, consistent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2670164134317714684", "cites_id": ["2670164134317714684"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010GL044399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_Oz-DSJUDiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
