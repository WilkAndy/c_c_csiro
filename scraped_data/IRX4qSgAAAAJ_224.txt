Specifically, the results and conclusions discussed in Figures 2c, 3c and 3d of their study are wrong.[2] The SSH observations used by LKF are comprised of 15 individual station records of varying length and have non\u2010uniform spatial distribution. The spatial coverage of SSH observations is sparse, with each station having a different period of record (see Table 1 of LKF). Many of the SSH records are less than 25 years in length. Some periods are represented by records from relatively few stations, while other periods are represented by more. The stations in the LKF analysis are spread over a wide geographical area with differing amounts of cloudiness and daylength. Simple arithmetic averages of available SSH observations will include significant inhomogeneities, and have the potential to induce a spurious trend. In LKF, the trend is simply due to an inclusion of longer SSH sites, situated further north, over time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=124371375006928670", "cites_id": ["124371375006928670"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Cowan/publication/248815667_Comment_on_On_the_recent_warming_in_the_Murray-Darling_Basin_Land_surface_interactions_misunderstood''_by_Lockart_et_al/links/0c96052af834da0f3e000000/Comment-on-On-the-recent-warming-in-the-Murray-Darling-Basin-Land-surface-interactions-misunderstood-by-Lockart-et-al.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hs-DSxvbuQEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 2}}
