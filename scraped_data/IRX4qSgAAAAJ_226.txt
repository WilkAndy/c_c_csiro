During 1980\u201398, warm SSTs induce positive precipitation and low pressure in the WTP. The associated enhanced convection dampens the initial warm SSTs by reflecting incoming solar radiation. The reduced incoming solar radiation into the ocean leads to a SST cooling tendency. In contrast, the associated southwesterly wind anomalies reduce oceanic mixing by decreasing the mean wind, contributing to an SST warming tendency, though relatively small. Therefore, the cloud\u2013radiation effect is a dominant process of the negative SST tendency. By contrast, during 1999\u20132014, although an SST cooling tendency is similarly induced by warm SST \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3666612880910009798", "cites_id": ["3666612880910009798"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/32/13/jcli-d-17-0737.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xkWDF_1s4jIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
