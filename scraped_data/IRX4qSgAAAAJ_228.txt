It is found that an enhanced westerly wind stress anomaly over the equatorial Pacific basin, usually associated with a meridional swing of South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), precedes the occurrence of the second peak. As the equatorial thermocline slope balances with the zonally integrated zonal\u2010wind stress, the westerly wind stress anomaly induces deepened thermocline and suppresses upwelling in the eastern Pacific for the double\u2010peak cases. On the other hand, enhanced latent heat release and reduced shortwave radiation cause a pause in warming between the two peaks. As a result, a strong El Ni\u00f1o, usually \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12692692942096864244", "cites_id": ["12692692942096864244"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/grl.50697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9JPKaPuAJbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
