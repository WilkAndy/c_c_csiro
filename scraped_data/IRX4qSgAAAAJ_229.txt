This issue is particularly relevant for Australia, where a highly variable climate, often characterised by severe floods and drought, is strongly influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), north-south variations in the midlatitude high-pressure belt position (Pittock, 1973), and, possibly, Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) variations (eg, Nicholls, 1989). A change in the properties of such modes may result in significant changes to Australian rainfall variability. Further, global warming signals may project onto these modes, contributing to secular trends in rainfall climatology. Trends towards lower rainfall in some regions suggested by global climate models would compound with rising temperatures and potential evaporation to exacerbate the strain on future water resources.Several of the above aspects have been examined using the CSIRO Mark 2 model, including whether the Pacific warming pattern is El Ni\u00f1o-like or La Ni\u00f1a-like (Cai and Whetton, 2000; 2001) and whether an observed rising trend in mean sea level pressure (MSLP) at southern midlatitudes (Cai et al., 2003a) can be at least partially attributed to global warming. The Mark 2 model studies are, however, limited by low resolution of the model and the fact that the model ENSO is too weak, with an amplitude of about one third of the observed. Thus the issue of ENSO response to climate change could not be addressed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3165515343169587230", "cites_id": ["3165515343169587230"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/30841115/ex28.pdf#page=8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hgis2G4r7isJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
