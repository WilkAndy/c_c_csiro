However, the pathway to these targets,,,,, and the impacts of a 1.5\u2009\u00b0C and 2\u2009\u00b0C warming on extreme El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events\u2014which severely influence weather patterns, agriculture, ecosystems, public health and economies,,,,,,,,,\u2014is little known. Here, by analysing climate models participating in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project\u2019s Phase 5 (CMIP5; ref. ) under a most likely emission scenario,, we demonstrate that extreme El Ni\u00f1o frequency increases linearly with the GMT towards a doubling at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C warming. This increasing frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o events continues for up to a century after GMT has stabilized, underpinned by an oceanic thermocline deepening that sustains faster warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific than the off \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 216, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14897472960765620522", "cites_id": ["14897472960765620522"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KvFrRbp0vs4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 39, "2019": 42, "2020": 49, "2021": 36, "2022": 28, "2023": 10}}
