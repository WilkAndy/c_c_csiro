How the Atlantic Ni\u00f1o/Ni\u00f1a sea surface temperature (SST) variability may change under greenhouse warming remains unclear. Here we find a robust suppression in future Atlantic Ni\u00f1o/Ni\u00f1a variability in models that simulate a reasonable mean climatology of the equatorial Atlantic. Under greenhouse warming, the equatorial Atlantic atmosphere becomes more stable, reducing sensitivity of the equatorial zonal winds to the zonal SST gradient; further, weakened trade winds lead to a deepened thermocline in the east, reducing SST sensitivity to thermocline anomalies. These changes feed into Bjerknes feedback to cause suppression in Atlantic Ni\u00f1o/Ni\u00f1a SST variability. These findings are in stark contrast to the Pacific and the Indian Ocean where El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a SST variability and strong \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5783135212187874932", "cites_id": ["5783135212187874932"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01444-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dPaCytXSQVAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
