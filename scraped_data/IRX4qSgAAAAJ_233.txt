This study demonstrates that dominant mode of subtropical SA sea surface temperature (SST) variability during the boreal winter, referred to as the South Atlantic Subtropical Dipole (SASD), contributes to occurrence of an El Ni\u00f1o a year later. During a positive SASD, low\u2010tropospheric anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the mid\u2010latitude SA reduce convective activities over southeastern South America. The low\u2010tropospheric divergence anomalies associated with the reduced convection attenuate the occurrence of South American Low\u2010Level Jet, and moisture supply is directed along the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The increased precipitation over the SACZ leads to an anomalous surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8121025667651265397", "cites_id": ["8121025667651265397"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL093338", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:deMuVNGts3AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
