Focusing on the midlatitude oceanic frontal zones, this study identifies a fingerprint of South Atlantic (SA) variability in the Antarctic summer sea ice. The interaction between spring SA sea surface temperature (SST) and summer storm\u2010track activity modulates the hemispheric atmospheric circulation, which in turn alters Antarctic summer sea ice concentration (SIC) through thermal and wind\u2010driven forcing. Specifically, warm SST anomalies in the western SA frontal zone, corresponding to the strengthened SST front, cause the increased SIC in the eastern Ross Sea via anomalous cold air advection and offshore drift of sea ice. The opposite effect (i.e., warm air advection and onshore ice drift) results in the decreased SIC in the northwestern Weddell Sea. The findings also imply a potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3181157599871580289", "cites_id": ["3181157599871580289"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL090810", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gTjhivu9JSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
