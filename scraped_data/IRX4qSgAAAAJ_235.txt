This weakened inter\u2010monsoon link was earlier attributed to a complete breakdown of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) links with the ASMR. We now find that this weakening was associated with strengthening of low\u2010level westerlies and an increase in local low\u2010level convergence in the northern Australia associated with the warm phase of the AMO during this period. This increased background convergence resulted in relatively enhanced ASMR during the El Ni\u00f1o summers during this period."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10105545262910055980", "cites_id": ["10105545262910055980"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.5722", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LKZiCeAbPowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
