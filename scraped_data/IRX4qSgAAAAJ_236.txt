The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and the tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV) are two dominant modes of tropical Pacific decadal variability that can interact with high\u2010frequency activities. Using a 500 year control integration from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model, we find that the difference in mean state between the low\u2010frequency and high\u2010frequency CP El Ni\u00f1o periods is similar to the decadal background condition concurrently contributed by a negative IPO and a positive TPDV. This decadal state features strengthened trade winds west of the International Date Line and anomalous cool sea surface temperatures across the central tropical Pacific. As such, positive zonal advection feedback is difficult to be generated over the central to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18179114525904102178", "cites_id": ["18179114525904102178"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL073846", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ImOoH1gwSfwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
