SPICE was designed to measure and monitor the ocean circulation, and to validate and improve numerical models.South Pacific thermocline waters are transported in the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC), from the subtropical gyre centre toward the southwest Pacific Oceancreating a major circulation pathway that redistributes water from the subtropics to the equator and to the southern ocean (Figure 1). The transit in the Coral, Solomon and Tasman Seas is potentially of great importance to the climate system. Changes in either the temperature or the amount of water arriving at the equator have the capability to modulate the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and produce basin-scale climate feedbacks. The southward thermocline pathways are, comparably, of major influence on Australia and New Zealand areas, affecting climate and biodiversity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4634560767497930019", "cites_id": ["4634560767497930019"], "pub_url": "https://www.documentation.ird.fr/hor/fdi:010058557", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IwWtjHZEUUAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
