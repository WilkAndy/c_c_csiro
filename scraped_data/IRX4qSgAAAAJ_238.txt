The shelf model is depth-integrated while the outer ocean has two layers of different water properties. It is assumed that the cold water comes from the bottom layer of the ocean model. When the shelf slope is of exponential form in the cross-shore distance, an analytical solution is obtainable. The two-layered ocean contains both barotropic and baroclinic modes, and allows an initial along-shore current in either layer. The shelf and the ocean are then coupled through continuity in both the surface elevation and cross-shore transport.The shelf width significantly affects the upwelling rate, with a smaller rate for a greater width. The upwelling rate is found to be directly proportional to the proximity of the cold water to the shelf head. Upwelling near the shelf break is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6658625553521282339", "cites_id": ["6658625553521282339"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771483710619", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I435eakwaFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
