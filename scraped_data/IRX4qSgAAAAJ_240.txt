The Fourier spectrum of the wind field over the western tropical Pacific is characterised by a large variety of peaks distributed from intra-seasonal to decadal time scales, suggesting that WWBs could be a result of nonlinear interactions on these time scales. Using a combination of observations and simulations with 15 coupled models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we demonstrate that the main drivers initiating WWBs are quantifiable physical processes rather than atmospheric stochastic signals. In this study, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) from the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA) is used to decompose daily zonal winds over the western equatorial Pacific into seasonal, interannual and decadal components.
