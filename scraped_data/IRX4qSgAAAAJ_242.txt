Initially the model is spun up with surface temperature and salinity relaxed to Levitus [1982] climatologies. The forcing condition for salinity is then switched to a diagnosed flux, while that for temperature is provided by a restoration with a timescale of either 30 days (strong relaxation) or 300 days (weak relaxation). The present\u2010day ocean climate is obtained under these two sets of thermohaline conditions. Under the strong restoration, the modeled North Atlantic Deep Water Formation (NADWF) settles to an intensified state. Under the weak relaxation, the model solution hardly differs from that of the spin\u2010up. The ocean states are then \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2233891592160445704", "cites_id": ["2233891592160445704"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95JC03137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CIV0QZFgAB8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
