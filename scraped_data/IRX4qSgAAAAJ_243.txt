The surface thermohaline forcing conditions are a Haney restoration, a Schopf zero heat capacity (ZHC) boundary condition, or a heat flux condition for temperature; and a Haney restoration or an equivalent salt flux for salinity. Only under a Haney restoring condition on temperature and a flux condition on salinity (hereafter referred to as restoring-flux conditions), does a positive feedback process develop as a result of the restoring condition on temperature, causing a rapid transition of the modelled North Atlantic Deep Water Formation (NADWF) to an intensified state. Among all the sets of surface boundary conditions tested in the present study, only under a set \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16000702068845465923", "cites_id": ["16000702068845465923"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/007966119500016X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q1FkmsHpDd4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
