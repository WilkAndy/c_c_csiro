It can experience an interannual extreme swing, moving hundreds of kilometres northwards during boreal spring, causing severe droughts in central-eastern Amazon and floods in northern South America. How its interannual variability will respond to global warming remains unknown. Here using state-of-the-art climate models under a high-emission scenario, we project a more-than-doubling increase of extreme northward swings. This increase from one event per 20.4 years in the twentieth century to one per 9.3 years in the twenty-first century is underpinned by a mean state change of sea surface temperature, with faster warming north of the Equator. The warming differential facilitates the increased frequency of extreme \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=94492693823780530", "cites_id": ["94492693823780530"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01445-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:snY8uZq0TwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
