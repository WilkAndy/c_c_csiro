However, the extent to which it benefits El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulation remains unknown. Here, comprehensive information on the sensitivity of ENSO performance to various resolutions is provided, based on a multi\u2010model and multi\u2010resolution ensemble of global coupled models. Overall, the reduced model biases of the equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) and precipitation mean state in higher\u2010resolution models may be attributed to increased oceanic resolution, and thus, better resolved eddy\u2010driven heat transport. ENSO spatial patterns were reproduced clearer in the eddy\u2010present models, likely due to the improved mean state and associated surface thermodynamic feedback. However, increasing atmospheric resolution alone deteriorates ENSO asymmetry, which may be due to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8745184431285007597", "cites_id": ["8745184431285007597"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL096932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7fQEAugiXXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
