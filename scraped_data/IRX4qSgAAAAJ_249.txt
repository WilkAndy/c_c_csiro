Therefore, it is a critical question how often such extreme El Ni\u00f1o will take place in the future. Although many climate models tend to simulate more frequency extreme El Ni\u00f1o under the greenhouse warming, there is a large intermodel diversity, with a range as large as the multimodel averaged change. The cause for this intermodel uncertainty is not known. Here we show that the north tropical Atlantic (NTA) mean precipitation plays a significant role in controlling changes in the extreme El Ni\u00f1o frequency under global warming; that is, much frequent extreme El Ni\u00f1o events under the greenhouse warming are simulated in the models whose climatological precipitation over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=130366707872078701", "cites_id": ["130366707872078701"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bZtAgdQnzwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
