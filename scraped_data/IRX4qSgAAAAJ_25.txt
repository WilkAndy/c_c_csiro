However, its response during the subsequent CO 2 stabilization period has not been explored. In this study, it is shown that the upward trend of the AAO reverses during such a stabilization period. This evolution of an upward trend and a subsequent reversal is present in each ensemble of three greenhouse simulations using three versions of the CSIRO Mark 2 coupled climate model. The evolution is shown to be linked with that of surface temperature, which also displays a corresponding trend and reversal, incorporating the well-known feature of interhemispheric warming asymmetry with smaller warming in the Southern Hemisphere (smaller as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 206, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17592340393567815987", "cites_id": ["17592340393567815987"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/16/10/1520-0442_2003_016_1525_trotao_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M4ldNmGMJPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 24, "2007": 23, "2008": 14, "2009": 18, "2010": 14, "2011": 10, "2012": 10, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
