These different states are associated with different patterns (the location and the penetration depth) of oceanic convection. Small changes in the thermal forcing conditions can push the system into an oscillatory regime. Once in this regime, oscillations appear to proceed as internal processes. One important implication of these results is that the present\u2010day ocean climate may not recover fully if the atmospheric CO2 level, after doubling, is lowered to the present\u2010day level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14990583441342817090", "cites_id": ["14990583441342817090"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49712455214", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QmMXZTdACdAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
