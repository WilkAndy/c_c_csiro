In this paper, the different zonal extents and the associated high\u2010latitude fresh water supplies of the Pacific and the Atlantic when under a zonally uniform fresh water flux forcing are examined, as a possible cause for the asymmetry. A series of numerical experiments using the Bryan\u2013Cox\u2013Semtner ocean general circulation model is performed. In order to achieve a true independence, the model configuration and the model forcing are so constructed that zonal extent is the only built\u2010in difference between the two oceans. Three configurations are used. They are (a) an idealized Atlantic Ocean (narrow zonal extent) alone, (b) an idealized Pacific Ocean (wider zonal extent) alone, and (c) a connected Pacific\u2013Atlantic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14415013135216929996", "cites_id": ["14415013135216929996"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49712454708", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zOwxjRJqDMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
