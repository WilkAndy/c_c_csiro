The oscillation is tantalizing in that it occurs under a relatively strong thermal damping (26.3 W m\u22122 K\u22121). Examinations involving a two\u2010dimensional OGCM, a simple thermal \u2018flip\u2013flop\u2019 model, and a three\u2010dimensional OGCM with and without the nonlinear effect of temperature in the state equation of sea water demonstrate that the oscillation is not driven by mechanisms such as the so\u2010called convective oscillator, or the advective overshooting oscillator. Instead, the oscillation is associated with the propagation of modelled long Rossby\u2010waves with westward phase velocity. It is found that the north\u2013south basin extent of the OGCM is an important factor; a larger north\u2013south basin extent is conducive to the generation of thermal wind flows crucial for initiating the propagation of disturbances.
