A projected increase in El Ni\u00f1o variability has been found to slow future mid-latitude Southern Ocean warming but how this impacts the Antarctic shelf ocean is unknown. Here we show that a projected increase in El Ni\u00f1o variability accelerates Antarctic shelf ocean warming, hastening ice shelf/sheet melt but slowing sea ice reduction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7484514378989489031", "cites_id": ["7484514378989489031"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01610-x", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
