Some studies report that Arctic warming may simultaneously induce a widespread cooling over Eurasia and frequent cold events over North America, especially during boreal winter. In contrast, other studies suggest a seesaw pattern of extreme temperature events with cold weather over East Asia accompanied by warm weather in North America on sub-seasonal time scales. It is unclear whether a systematic linkage in surface air temperature (SAT) exists between the two continents, let alone their interaction with Arctic sea ice. Here, we reveal a dipole pattern of SAT in boreal winter featuring a cooling (warming) in the Eurasian continent accompanied by a warming (cooling) in the North American continent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16788850610262930909", "cites_id": ["16788850610262930909"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac9ecd/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3XXSy636_egJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
