The ADP is superimposed on the long\u2010term climatic trends, modulating the response of the mean climate to external forcing by modifying the signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio. The response of the ADP to greenhouse warming is unknown. Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models that capture main characteristics of the ADP, we find a robust reduction in variability of ADP under greenhouse warming. The warming\u2010induced sea ice loss limits the magnitude of ADP SAT variability through surface albedo feedback. The El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are two main triggering mechanisms of the ADP on interannual time scale. In a warmer climate, decreased variability of the SAM contributes to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12858088760391754273", "cites_id": ["12858088760391754273"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL094863", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IeKXPZobcbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
