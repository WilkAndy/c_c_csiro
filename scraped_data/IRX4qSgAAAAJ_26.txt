Is there a systematic pIOD linkage beyond these two natural disasters? We show that out of 21 significant bushfires seasons since 1950, 11 were preceded by a pIOD. During Victoria's wet season, particularly spring, a pIOD contributes to lower rainfall and higher temperatures exacerbating the dry conditions and increasing the fuel load leading into summer. Consequently, pIODs are effective in preconditioning Victoria for bushfires, more so than El Ni\u00f1o events, as seen in the impact on soil moisture on interannual time scales and in multi\u2010decadal changes since the 1950s. Given that the recent increase in pIOD occurrences is consistent with what is expected from global warming \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 203, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3497443851241965402", "cites_id": ["3497443851241965402"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009GL039902", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WscmB6dqiTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 11, "2012": 6, "2013": 11, "2014": 13, "2015": 18, "2016": 9, "2017": 11, "2018": 17, "2019": 11, "2020": 24, "2021": 37, "2022": 23, "2023": 6}}
