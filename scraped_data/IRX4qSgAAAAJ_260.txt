One type is characterized by a quick transition from an El Ni\u00f1o event into a La Ni\u00f1a event in the following winter, and the other type involves a slow decay to an almost neutral state or a continuous El Ni\u00f1o event. While both the Indian and the Atlantic Oceans contribute to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s transition processes, we further find that sea surface temperature (SST) conditions in the eastern subtropical North Pacific and the associated surface wind anomalies play important roles in determining the different types of El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s transition processes through atmosphere\u2013ocean coupled processes. In particular, northeasterly wind anomalies in the central subtropical North Pacific during the early spring, which is in consequence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17470112235426948493", "cites_id": ["17470112235426948493"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-020-05530-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jSXUeoROcvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
