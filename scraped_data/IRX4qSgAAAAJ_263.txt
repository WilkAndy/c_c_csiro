In an attempt to provide some guidance, twelve dynamical downscaling simulations have been performed using the CSIRO Conformal-cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) for the South East Queensland (SEQ) region. Changes in exceptional rainfall, temperature and evaporation events have been projected. In addition, a drought index was derived from these data using a modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8012158520900747774", "cites_id": ["8012158520900747774"], "pub_url": "http://www.urbanwateralliance.org.au/publications/UWSRA-tr62.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_oFoernnMG8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
