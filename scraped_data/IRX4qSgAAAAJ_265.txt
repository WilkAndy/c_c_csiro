He proposed an \u201cIsland Rule\u201d and used it in conjunction with the Sverdrup relationship such that given a set of surface wind-stress field, global wind-driven circulation can be determined. We have applied this Island Rule model to monthly surface wind stress fields from NCEP (Kalnay et al., 1996) reanalysis and ERA40 (Uppala, et al., 2005) reanalysis to generate the wind-driven circulation history in terms of barotropic stream function and steric height. This dataset is now available to serve the global Earth system research community for climate model validation purposes and for description of variations and trends of the wind-driven ocean circulation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18109763349661758073", "cites_id": ["18109763349661758073"], "pub_url": "https://research.usq.edu.au/item/9y01z/a-dataset-of-the-wind-driven-global-ocean-circulation-for-climate-research", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eTL6HtHNUvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
