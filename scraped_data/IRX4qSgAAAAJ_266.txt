Because of the lack of observations, descriptions of the detailed circulation pathways have been difficult, and have been provided in terms of conceptual schemes 3, 4. Here, we establish the first quantitative, global three-dimensional picture of the THC using a Lagrangian reconstruction, which integrates hundreds of thousands of water parcel trajectories in a global ocean general circulation model. The resulting pattern enlightens the crucial role of the wind action in structuring the return flow to the North Atlantic. In particular, it reveals a strong link with the three subtropical gyres of the Southern Hemisphere (SH), which merge into a large three-ocean wide cell, referred to as the SH \u201csupergyre\u201d. Because the THC pathways connect different regions of air-sea interaction, variations in their structure may influence the water masses they convey, and their associated heat and fresh-water transport."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1438455527272717331", "cites_id": ["1438455527272717331"], "pub_url": "https://corpora.tika.apache.org/base/docs/govdocs1/228/228092.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E5xJSK5r9hMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
