Owing to its strong rainfall gradient, a small displacement in the position of the SPCZ causes drastic changes to hydroclimatic conditions and the frequency of extreme weather events\u2014such as droughts, floods and tropical cyclones\u2014experienced by vulnerable island countries in the region,,,,,,. The SPCZ position varies from its climatological mean location with the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), moving a few degrees northward during moderate El Ni\u00f1o events and southward during La Ni\u00f1a events,,. During strong El Ni\u00f1o events, however, the SPCZ undergoes an extreme swing\u2014by up to ten degrees of latitude toward the Equator\u2014and collapses to a more zonally oriented structure with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=985596514366659721", "cites_id": ["985596514366659721"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11358", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iRyw0s6KrQ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 18, "2014": 22, "2015": 30, "2016": 18, "2017": 21, "2018": 19, "2019": 12, "2020": 17, "2021": 27, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
