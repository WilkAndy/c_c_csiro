The projected IWC weakening has previously been attributed to slower warming in the east than the west, that is, to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)-like warming pattern. However, such a warming pattern can also be induced by IWC weakening. As a result, the cause-and-effect relationship cannot be easily determined, and the projected change is poorly constrained and highly uncertain. Here, using a suite of coupled climate model simulations under a high-emission scenario, we find that the IWC slowdown is accompanied by not only a positive IOD-like warming pattern but also anomalous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6024931700049923956", "cites_id": ["6024931700049923956"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-022-00242-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dE93sXXbnFMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
