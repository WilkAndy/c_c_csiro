We examine the diversity of surface temperature (Ts) anomalies related to weak, moderate and strong ENSO events in North America (NA) for present and future climates forced under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios in CMIP6 climate models. When ENSO intensity is weaker, the NA Ts anomalies are more sensitive/variable to different SSP scenarios than moderate and strong ENSO. The NA Ts anomalies are more sensitive to the impacts of ENSO intensity under a sustainable climate change scenario, compared to the high SSP scenario. We discuss why the diversity of ENSO\u2010related Ts response projections differs in the combination of ENSO intensity and climate change scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3693360254761918922", "cites_id": ["3693360254761918922"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL096135", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ymGhXJVzQTMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
