The robustness of a CP El Ni\u00f1o preconditioning a strong pIOD has not been investigated. Here, we show that March\u2010April\u2010May (MAM) easterly anomalies over the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) induced by a preceding CP El Ni\u00f1o drive a thermocline shallowing conducive to an early equatorial EIO cooling. However, the same winds also generate off\u2010equatorial downwelling Rossby waves in the southern EIO, which reflect as downwelling Kelvin waves, able to weaken the initial anomalies. Furthermore, zonal winds in June\u2010July\u2010August (JJA) can either be beneficial or unfavorable for the developing pIOD. Only when the equatorial easterlies, EIO cooling, and thermocline shallowing are sufficiently amplified by JJA does a strong pIOD occur. Despite this, a multi\u2010century model simulation suggests that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8064437695097442084", "cites_id": ["8064437695097442084"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL092223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JI-NQVuj6m8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
