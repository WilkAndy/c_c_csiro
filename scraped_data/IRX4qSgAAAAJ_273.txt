To connect the dots between drought prediction, monitoring, and decision making, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Climate Symposium 2013 was held with the theme of regional cooperation on drought prediction science for disaster preparedness and management (www. apcc21. org/eng/acts/pastsym/japcc0202_viw. jsp? symp_yy= 2013). The event was organized by the APEC Climate Center and the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics, with financial support from the APEC Secretariat."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3593983049336527938", "cites_id": ["3593983049336527938"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/96/4/bams-d-14-00049.1.xml?tab_body=pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qpx6qIpk4DEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2}}
