The 1998/99 extreme La Ni\u00f1a that followed the 1997/98 super El Ni\u00f1o event (6McPhaden), switched extreme El Ni\u00f1o-induced severe droughts to devastating floods in western Pacific countries, and El Ni\u00f1o-induced catastrophic floods to severe drought in southwest of US (4Bell1999; 7Hoerling&Kumar2003). Recent discoveries have revealed robust changes in El Ni\u00f1o under greenhouse warming 8Cai2014; 9Power2013; 10Santoso2013), including an increased frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o, but how La Ni\u00f1a events will change in a warming climate are yet to be examined. Here we present climate modelling evidence for a statistically significant increase in the frequency of extreme La Ni\u00f1a of up to a near doubling when considering the more extreme events. Approximately 75% of the increase occurs in the year following an extreme El Ni\u00f1o, thus projecting more frequent climatic swings of opposite extremes from one year to the next, analogous to the 1997-1999 extreme episodes. We estimate these changes by aggregating results from climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 (CMIP5) multi-model databases (11Taylor2013). During an extreme La Ni\u00f1a, coldest sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies develop in the central Pacific (12Takahashi \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4341969438674382500", "cites_id": ["4341969438674382500"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4341969438674382500&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pO7JITPGQTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
