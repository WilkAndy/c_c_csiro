The Climate and Water project within the Urban Water Security Research Alliance has been focusing on these issues, including:(i) what causes drought and floods in the SEQ region;(ii) how the properties of drought (intensity, duration and frequency) may change in a warming climate, in addition to forcing by multidecadal variability; and (iii) how best to translate global projections of climate change (rainfall and other hydrological fields) into future water availability information. Here we provide a brief synthesis, showing that in terms of rainfall, the fluctuations that we experienced can be accounted for by multidecadal variability in the Pacific Ocean and its modulation on the regional rainfall teleconnection with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. Further, we show that while the direction of future rainfall change remains uncertain, the impact of rising temperature will increase the risk of longer-lasting and deeper droughts in the future, with significant implication for inflows into dams and water resource security. This is manifested through an increase in the proportion of SEQ experiencing exceptionally hot conditions, and a similar increase in the incidence of potential evaporation extremes and in the proportional area experiencing severe water balance deficit. The implications for extreme floods are yet to be examined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:PYBJJbyH-FwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18382521182256978019", "cites_id": ["18382521182256978019"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18382521182256978019&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y1iF2J7VG_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
