If these trends were to continue, there would be important implications for future water availability. An exception is north-west Australia, where rainfall has been increasing. Climate modelling science is now at a stage where it is increasingly possible to assess the relative importance of various forcing components in driving the observed rainfall trend, and to project the future direction of rainfall changes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6276963155296434534", "cites_id": ["6276963155296434534"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/2007/caiwj_a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zrmoo7tAHFcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2}}
