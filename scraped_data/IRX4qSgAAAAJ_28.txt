Through an automatic tracking scheme, the cyclones and anticyclones associated with HWs affecting Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth are tracked at both the surface and upper levels, producing for the first time a synoptic climatology that reveals the broader connections associated with these extreme phenomena. The results show that a couplet (or pressure dipole) formed by transient cyclones and anticyclones can reinforce the HW similarly to what is observed in cold surges (CS), with an obvious opposite polarity. Our results show that there is a large degree of mobility in the synoptic signature associated with the passage of the upper level ridges before they reach Australia and the blocking is established, with HW-associated surface anticyclones often initiating over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=317722215416155733", "cites_id": ["317722215416155733"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-011-1016-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VU4h66vGaAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 13, "2015": 17, "2016": 18, "2017": 23, "2018": 12, "2019": 20, "2020": 23, "2021": 22, "2022": 26, "2023": 11}}
