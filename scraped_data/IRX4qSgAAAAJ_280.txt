El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO), as the dominant remote forcing, triggers Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o/Ni\u00f1a. However, how this teleconnection will respond to greenhouse warming is unclear. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel simulations, we find a weakened ENSO\u2010Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o/Ni\u00f1a teleconnection under greenhouse warming, which manifests as weakened atmospheric teleconnection from La Ni\u00f1a to Ningaloo Ni\u00f1o. Such weakened teleconnection can be linked to the tropical Pacific mean state changes including an El Ni\u00f1o\u2010like warming pattern and more stable atmosphere in the future climate, both suppressing the atmospheric convection in the western tropical Pacific, leading to a weaker Matsuno\u2010Gill response in the southeastern Indian Ocean.
