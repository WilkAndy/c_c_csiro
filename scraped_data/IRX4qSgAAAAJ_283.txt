Positive IOD events are associated with devastating floods over parts of East Africa and India, while Australia and Indonesia experience dry conditions. Under greenhouse warming, climate models project a weakening of the positive IOD skewness, but their simulation of present\u2010day skewness is too weak. Here we show that this bias and the projected skewness change are related to the simulation of the climatological zonal wind in the central equatorial Indian Ocean. In particular, models with overly weak present\u2010day westerlies, which is a common model bias, generate overly weak present\u2010day skewness and a smaller projected reduction in skewness. Improving the ability of models in simulating stronger westerly winds may lead to stronger present\u2010day \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5534404000810155706", "cites_id": ["5534404000810155706"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL071208", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uj7Kvx0nzkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
