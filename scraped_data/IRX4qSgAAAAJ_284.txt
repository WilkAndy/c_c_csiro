Discussion sessions focused on model evaluation and metrics and on envisioning future observations as part of the Tropical Pacific Observing System 2020 (TPOS 2020) initiative. The workshop made clear that there is a rich set of observed atmospheric and oceanic phenomena associated with ENSO. The importance of wind variability and of equatorial Pacific clouds and their seasonally modulated feedbacks with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were highlighted in several presentations. For example, the SST\u2013wind relationship exhibits marked nonlinearities, with the central equatorial Pacific trade winds having a greater sensitivity to strong El Ni\u00f1os than to either La Ni\u00f1as or moderate El Ni\u00f1os. The seasonally and ENSO-modulated advective warming effects of tropical instability waves on the equatorial Pacific cold tongue were also highlighted. The initial equatorial heat content has traditionally been viewed as an essential precursor for ENSO events. However, a presentation showed that coupled model simulations could spontaneously generate ENSO events without subsurface precursors or largescale wind triggers, albeit with reduced amplitude.On the other hand, the interplay between westerly wind events and the initial subsurface conditions, whether recharged or in a neutral state, appears to contribute to ENSO diversity by influencing the location of the event along the equator. Intraseasonal atmospheric variability (both westerly and easterly wind events and the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation) was also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7324322487276590388", "cites_id": ["7324322487276590388"], "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/29731", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NNWGCn84pWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
