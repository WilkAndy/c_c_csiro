They typically occur during the southern rainy season from April-September. The temperature of this Throughflow surface water is strongly linked to an ocean-atmosphere feedback cycle known as the EI Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A transition from an EI Nifio (which typically brings dry conditions to much ofeastern Australia) to a La Nifia (wetter conditions across eastern Australia) tends to be conducive to late autumn rainfall across northern Victoria, south-west New South Wales and eastern South Australia. From the mid-1970s onwards t'here have tended to be more EI Nifio events than La Nifias, which have also been more protracted in terms of duration. What this means is that the western Pacific Ocean, which is linked to late autumn rainfall across SEA, has tended be more El Nifio-like, and spending less time transitioning to La Nina-like \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11519075984058786490", "cites_id": ["11519075984058786490"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/ielapa.200809445", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uqKOqpP6258J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
