We show that both types feature a strong asymmetry between impacts of La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o in austral autumn (March\u2013May); the La Ni\u00f1a\u2010Australian rainfall teleconnection is statistically significant, whereas the El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Australian rainfall relationship is not. A La Ni\u00f1a Modoki cold anomaly near the Dateline is effective in shifting convection westward, causing an autumn rainfall increase over northwestern Australia extending to the northern Murray\u2010Darling Basin, rather than over the east as in a conventional La Ni\u00f1a. During an El Ni\u00f1o Modoki, the tendency for lower Australian rainfall is far weaker. The asymmetry explains the strong inter\u2010ENSO variations in rainfall anomalies, including 1983, when a strong El Ni\u00f1o residual was associated with a wet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15723286743846148605", "cites_id": ["15723286743846148605"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009GL037885", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_dmO7PxVNNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 11, "2013": 13, "2014": 15, "2015": 21, "2016": 17, "2017": 20, "2018": 14, "2019": 23, "2020": 17, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 1}}
