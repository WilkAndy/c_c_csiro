The transit in the Coral Sea is potentially of great importance to tropical climate prediction because changes in either the temperature or the amount of water arriving at the equator have the capability to modulate the ENSO cycle and thereby produce basin-scale climate feedbacks. The Southwest Pacific is a region of complex ocean circulation. The South Equatorial Current is split in strong zonal jets upon encountering the island archipelago. Those jets partition on the Australian eastern boundary to feed the East Australian Current for the southern branch and the North Queensland Current and eventually the Equatorial Undercurrent for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9378271886010438283", "cites_id": ["9378271886010438283"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFMOS41B0537G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i1KvlJdQJoIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
