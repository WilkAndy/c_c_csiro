By contrast, oscillations induced by thermal forcing remain largely unexplored. In this study, the generation of persistent thermal oscillations in the Bryan\u2013Cox\u2013Semtner model is described.Initially the model is spun up by restoring surface temperature and salinity in the model to prescribed climatologies. When a steady state is reached, switching to mixed boundary\u2010conditions leads to a collapse in the modelled thermohaline circulation. Such a collapse suggests that the freshwater forcing is too strong. A reduction in the forcing of the freshwater flux then prevents the collapse, but no persistent oscillation occurs.
