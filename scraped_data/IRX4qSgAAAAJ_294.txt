Figure 1, taken from Delworth et al.(1993), shows that changes in the surface buoyancy flux play only a weak role in the oscillation, with the changes in the surface heat flux acting to oppose the contribution from poleward heat transport, but with the latter dominating the total. Figure 1 suggests it should be possible to produce a similar oscillation in an ocean-only model driven by constant surface flux fields."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12973717168940273473", "cites_id": ["12973717168940273473"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NH0QAQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA73&dq=info:QU8SBwfnC7QJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qdoRyWyGFZ&sig=Bo91JGZ6KnurJMwP32RaSxsSd9k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QU8SBwfnC7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1}}
