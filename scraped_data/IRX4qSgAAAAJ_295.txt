The interface between the first layer and the second layer is held at a constant height, and across this interface mixing is allowed. The thickness of the first layer is almost constant subject to free surface changes. In comparison with the conventional layered model, the new model has a longer integration time, enabling examinations of the late stage of an upwelling event. It also allows a temperature signal to be transmitted through the first layer, producing a more realistic and complete simulation. When the model is applied to the Bonney coast upwelling system, it not only assesses the role played by the thermodynamics but also resolves, for the first time, the relaxation phase of a well-observed upwelling episode off the Bonney coast. Sea level and current reversals are found to be poor indicators of upwelling termination."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15902086044461897979", "cites_id": ["15902086044461897979"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771405800812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-xjZKwGPr9wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1}}
