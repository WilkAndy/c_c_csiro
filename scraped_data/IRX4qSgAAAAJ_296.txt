Over 90% of the land ice mass loss occurred around a limited area in West Antarctica, accompanied by a rapid surface warming rate about three times the global mean. In contrast, surface warming and glacier mass loss around East Antarctica are not significant, until the decades since 2000 when several individual stations show that the temperature trends might have reversed. The asymmetric climate changes between East- and West- Antarctica are largely attributable to the inter-decadal variabilities over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans through tropical-polar teleconnections, leaving open the question of whether the post-2000 phase shift of the lower-latitude decadal variability causes a flip of the asymmetric Antarctic changes. Here, by synthesizing 26 in-situ observations and six reanalysis datasets using a statistical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acd8d4/meta", "cites_per_year": {}}
