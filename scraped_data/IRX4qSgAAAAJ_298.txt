However, after 2000, the warming over several stations in the Antarctic Peninsula slowed down, whereas the South Pole experienced fast warming. These reversed SAT trends show strong regionality and seasonality, together with large uncertainty and disagreement among different observational and reanalysis datasets, which makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the multi-decadal Antarctic SAT trend and its reversal. In this study, we use the Combined Maximum Covariance Analysis (CMCA) method to extract the most coherent modes of the Antarctic SAT trends among six reanalysis datasets and 26 station-based observations. Further analysis shows that the reversals of the SAT trends before and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-023-06825-4", "cites_per_year": {}}
