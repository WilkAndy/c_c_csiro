A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming. A key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern Pacific sea surface temperature, but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing. Here we show that a pronounced strengthening in Pacific trade winds over the past two decades\u2014unprecedented in observations/reanalysis data and not captured by climate models\u2014is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical Pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake. The extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the Pacific shallow overturning \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 1325, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2330953553937653471", "cites_id": ["2330953553937653471"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:315jSug1WSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 74, "2015": 193, "2016": 139, "2017": 190, "2018": 153, "2019": 163, "2020": 124, "2021": 131, "2022": 104, "2023": 34}}
