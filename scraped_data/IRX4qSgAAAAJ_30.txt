In this study, daily rainfall over five geographically dispersed and homogenized weather stations within SWWA are analyzed. A peak over threshold method from the extreme value theory is used to model daily rainfall above a given threshold. The Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Pittitt (change point) test was applied to detect changes in annual, winter (May\u2013October), and summer (November\u2013April) maximum daily rainfall. Change points for winter extreme daily rainfall were found around 1965, based on different individual stations, with the extreme daily rainfall reduced since then. To demonstrate the degree of change in the winter extreme daily rainfall, at 1965 the data were stratified, and generalized Pareto \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3559003225023094073", "cites_id": ["3559003225023094073"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/18/6/jcli-3296.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OZ34pZMeZDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 10, "2008": 4, "2009": 13, "2010": 13, "2011": 11, "2012": 9, "2013": 19, "2014": 21, "2015": 14, "2016": 13, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
