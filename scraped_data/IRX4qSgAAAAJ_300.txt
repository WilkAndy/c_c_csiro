Its interannual variation contributes the most to ENSO amplitude. Thus, understanding the predictability of the WCEP interannual wind is of great importance for better predictions of ENSO. Here we show that the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) and the South Pacific Oscillation (SPO) alternate in fueling this interannual wind from late boreal winter to austral winter in the presence of background trade winds in different hemispheres. During the boreal winter-spring, the NPO registers footprints in the tropics by benefiting from the Pacific meridional mode and modulating the northwestern Pacific intertropical convergence zone (NITCZ). However, as austral winter approaches, the SPO takes over the role of the NPO in maintaining the anomalous NITCZ \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:RJOyoaXV5v8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/aop/JCLI-D-22-0461.1/JCLI-D-22-0461.1.xml", "cites_per_year": {}}
