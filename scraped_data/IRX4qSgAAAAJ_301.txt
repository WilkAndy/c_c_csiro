Although it is recognized that mesoscale eddies with scales of ~40\u2013300\u2009km greatly contribute to the EHT, the role of submesoscale eddies with scales of ~1\u201340\u2009km remains unclear. Here, using two state-of-the-art high-resolution simulations (resolutions of 1/48\u00b0 and 1/24\u00b0), we find that submesoscale eddies significantly enhance the total poleward EHT in the Southern Ocean with an enhancement percentage reaching 19\u201348% in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current band. By comparing the eddy energy budgets between the two simulations, we detect that the primary role of submesoscale eddies is to strengthen mesoscale eddies (and thus their heat transport capability) through \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36991-2", "cites_per_year": {}}
