However, quantifying the impact on global economy has been a challenge and has so far focused on tangible loss such as reduced agriculture outputs and infrastructure damage. Elusive are issues to what extent the impact affects the macroeconomy, how long the impact lasts, and how the impact may change in a warming climate. Using a smooth nonlinear climate-economy model fitted with historical data, here we find a damaging impact from El Ni\u00f1o in which acceleration of impact lasts for three years after an initial shock, with a total effect an order of magnitude greater than previous estimates; impact from La Ni\u00f1a is not symmetric and far weaker. We attribute a loss of US $2.1 T and US $4.0 T in global economy to the 1997-98 and 2015-16 El Ni\u00f1o \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:2ywjKiB__4kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-1022.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
