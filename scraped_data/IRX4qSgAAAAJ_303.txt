Its positive phase, characterized by anomalously warm western TIO and anomalously cold southeastern TIO, is usually stronger than its negative phase, namely a positively skewed IOD. Here, we investigate causes for the IOD asymmetry using a prototype IOD model, of which physical processes include both linear and nonlinear feedback processes, El Nino\u2019s asymmetric impact, and a state-dependent noise. Parameters for the model were empirically obtained using various reanalysis SST data sets. The results reveal that the leading cause of IOD asymmetry without accounting seasonality is a local nonlinear process, and secondly the state-dependent noise, the direct effect by the positively skewed ENSO and its nonlinear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-2165.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
