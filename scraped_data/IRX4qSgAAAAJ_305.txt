Large marine ecosystems (LMEs) cover~ 22% of the global ocean but account for 95% of global fisheries catches. Yet how climate change affects MHWs over LMEs remains unknown because such LMEs are confined to the coast where low-resolution climate models are known to have biases. Here, using a high-resolution Earth system model that resolves ocean mesoscale eddies and improves the capability to reproduce MHWs compared with the coarse-resolution models, we apply a\" future threshold\" that considers MHWs as anomalous warming above the evolving long-term warming and find that the future intensity and annual days of MHWs over the majority of the LMEs remain higher than in the present-day climate. These increases in MHWs suggest that even if species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:isU91gLudPYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFMGC23C..03G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
