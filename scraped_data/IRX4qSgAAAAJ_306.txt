Yet their response to greenhouse warming and feedback on the mean\u2010state change remain unknown. Using a long\u2010term high\u2010resolution climate simulation under a high carbon emission scenario, we show that submesoscale eddies in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific weaken, leading to an \u223c50% reduction in their upward heat flux at the end of the 21st century, compared to its mid\u201020th century level. This reduction is caused by an intensified stratification and a weakened cold tongue thermal front associated with a projected El Ni\u00f1o\u2010like warming pattern. The reduced vertical submesoscale eddy heat flux plays an important role in the anomalous heat budget of the surface layer over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific under greenhouse warming, acting as negative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022GL100533", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nbx62tDJbfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
