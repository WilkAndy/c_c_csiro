Here, using a set of CO2 ramp-up and\u2013down ensemble experiments, we show that frequency and maximum intensity of CEE events increase further in the ramp-down period from the ramp-up period. Such changes in CEE are associated with the southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and intensi ed nonlinear rainfall response to SST change in the ramp-down period. The increasing frequency of CEE has substantial impacts on regional abnormal events and contributed considerably to regional mean climate changes to the CO2 forcings."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1938270/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DrPhrBjtnMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
