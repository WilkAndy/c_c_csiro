Here we present a seven-year lag response in South Australia (SA) precipitation to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in a positive Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) phase (1979-1998). This teleconnection between a positive SAM phase and increased SA precipitation, and vice-versa, statistically consists of three sequential steps: a 27-season lag positive correlation between sea subsurface potential temperature (SSPT) to the south of SA and SAM; a zero-season lag positive correlation between sea surface temperature (SST) and SSPT; and a 2-season positive lag correlation between SA precipitation and SST. Physically, this teleconnection seems to be associated with a supergyre circulation of the Southern Hemisphere Oceans, which transfers SAM signal via subsurface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFMGC25E0714G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
