It shows that the coupling between storm-track anomalies and SSTAs is most prominent in austral summer (January\u2013March, JFM). Firstly, large cold SSTAs in the western South Indian Ocean (SIO), corresponding to the strengthened SST front on the equator side, substantially intensify the storm-track activity manifested by the increased low-level poleward transient eddy heat flux over the entire SH. The coherent intensification of the atmospheric baroclinicity and the subtropical jet associated with such strengthened SST front provides baroclinic energy for the growth of synoptic eddies. Further, the intensified storm-track activity induces large cold \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-020-05503-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TylUbI0iUIAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
