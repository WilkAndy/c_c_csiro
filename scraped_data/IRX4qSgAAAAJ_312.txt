During an extreme positive IOD (pIOD), the impact includes floods in the East African countries, stronger-than-normal Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR), and droughts in Indonesia and southeastern Australia. Some extreme pIOD events occur concurrently with an El Ni\u00f1o, which exerts a generally opposite impact on the ISMR, with an extreme pIOD tending to increase ISMR whereas an El Ni\u00f1o tends to decrease ISMR. Here we show that under greenhouse warming the frequency of extreme pIOD increases substantially, whereas that of moderate pIOD decreases moderately. Therefore, a higher frequency of extreme ISMR is projected even if the impact on ISMR does not change, but the impact of extreme pIOD on the ISMR also intensifies. Thus, more frequent and more extreme ISMR as a result of the response \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128224021000107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h8pfnCkz5lkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
