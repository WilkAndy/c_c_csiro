Here we provide a review of progress on this topic and an update in light of recent advances. Climate models have produced widely diverging results based on the traditional sea surface temperature (SST) metrics of ENSO. Steering away from these static measures, but more carefully examining the underlying processes and the associated key physical characteristics of ENSO, a clearer picture begins to emerge. Due to the nonlinear response of the atmosphere to SSTs, climate models project an increase in ENSO driven precipitation. Such a response tends to be robust owing to the relatively strong intermodel agreement in projected changes of the Pacific mean climate, marked by equatorially enhanced warming and weakened Walker Circulation.
