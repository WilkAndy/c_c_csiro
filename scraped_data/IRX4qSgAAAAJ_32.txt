Robust projected changes in certain aspects of ENSO have been recently established,,. However, there is as yet no consensus on the change in the magnitude of the associated sea surface temperature (SST) variability,,, commonly used to represent ENSO amplitude,, despite its strong effects on marine ecosystems and rainfall worldwide,,,,. Here we show that the response of ENSO SST amplitude is time-varying, with an increasing trend in ENSO amplitude before 2040, followed by a decreasing trend thereafter. We attribute the previous lack of consensus to an expectation that the trend in ENSO amplitude over the entire twenty-first century is unidirectional, and to unrealistic model dynamics of tropical Pacific SST \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13176930947576669394", "cites_id": ["13176930947576669394"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2326", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0qQo6OHc3bYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 13, "2016": 13, "2017": 29, "2018": 20, "2019": 24, "2020": 21, "2021": 23, "2022": 21, "2023": 8}}
