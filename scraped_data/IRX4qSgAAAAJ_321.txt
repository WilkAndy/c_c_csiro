The complex processes that govern ENSO and its impacts have generated intense research over the past decades, reviewed in previous chapters: a better understanding of how ENSO responds to anthropogenic climate change requires effort in resolving how ENSO responds to and interacts with a multitude of factors such as weather\u2010scale phenomena, volcanic eruptions, orbital forcing, etc. This chapter highlights some key unresolved issues in ENSO, supplemented by analysis of paleoclimate data and past and future state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art climate model simulations. First, paleo\u2010ENSO reconstructions indicate a  weakening of ENSO variability accompanying a weaker seasonal cycle, albeit lacking a clear orbital signal. This apparent positive correlation between changes in the magnitude of the seasonal cycle and ENSO amplitude seems to hold in future greenhouse\u2010gas forcing scenarios. Yet the mechanisms behind this relationship remain unclear, as accelerated paleoclimate model simulations under orbital forcing show the opposite relationship, in accordance with the idea of frequency entrainment in nonlinear oscillatory systems. These results underscore another prominent unresolved question: is ENSO a nonlinear system exhibiting regime\u2010like behavior (internally generated or in response to external forcing), or is ENSO a stochastically forced linear system whose behavior is modulated by noise? The  community\u2019s efforts to answer this question face the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pr.ibs.re.kr/handle/8788114/12110", "cites_per_year": {}}
