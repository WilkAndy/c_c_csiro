This event had significant impact on regional and global climate. The Earth's surface experienced its warmest year on record at the time in 1998, and regions surrounding the Pacific experienced extreme weather events, such as droughts in Indonesia and floods in Peru. In eastern Australia during spring (September-November), less rainfall than average would typically be expected during an El Ni\u00f1o event, this was seen during the 1982 and 2015 strong El Ni\u00f1o events. In 1997 however, near average east Australian spring rainfall was observed. Explanations for the comparatively unusual rainfall in 1997 range from stochastic weather events, to the remoteness of the peak sea surface temperature anomalies to Australia. In this study, we show our current understanding of how the 1997 El Nino event influenced east Australian spring rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:MhiOAD_qIWkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMGC31D1223V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
