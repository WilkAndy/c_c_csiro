Its reach is global, and it can force climate variations of the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans by perturbing the global atmospheric circulation. Less appreciated is how the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans affect the Pacific. Especially noteworthy is the multidecadal Atlantic warming that began in the late 1990s, because recent research suggests that it has influenced Indo-Pacific climate, the character of the ENSO cycle, and the hiatus in global surface warming. Discovery of these pantropical interactions provides a pathway forward for improving predictions of climate variability in the current climate and for refining projections of future climate under different anthropogenic forcing scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMOS24A..02C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
