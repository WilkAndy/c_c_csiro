By analyzing a large number of observational data such as PM 2.5 in China from 2014-2016, we investigated the spatial and temporal distributions of haze in China, and identified two major pollution areas during winter season, ie, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ) area and the Northeast of China. The 3-year winter seasonal mean PM 2.5 concentrations over these two regions reach 100\u03bcg/m 3 or more, exceeding the air quality standard. Favorable meteorological condition is a key factor driving the haze pollution, and atmospheric stagnation has been commonly used as a major meteorological factor leading to severe haze. However, we found that the standard atmospheric stagnation index only partly explains the occurrence of haze in Beijing. This study further investigates the meteorological mechanism over the JJJ and found climate variability such as El \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.A21E..10G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
