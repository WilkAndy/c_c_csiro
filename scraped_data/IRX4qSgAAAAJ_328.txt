The causes of this polar amplification (PA) are still debated. While some studies highlight the importance of the surface-albedo feedback, others find larger contributions from longwave feedbacks, specifically the local lapse-rate and Planck feedbacks. Additionally, changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat transport are thought to play a role. Here we perform a full hierarchy of climate model simulations-AGCM experiments, slab ocean model experiments, and fully coupled experiments-with CO2 forcing prescribed in distinct geographical regions to determine the causes of PA. The sum of climate responses to regional forcings approximates well the response to global forcing, thus permitting an attribution of polar warming to local and remote processes.
