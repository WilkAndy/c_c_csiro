Occasionally, the warm and cold phases of ENSO, the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, can grow into unusually strong events, elevating the likelihood of severe weather events and causing extreme climatic conditions. Modeling studies have projected an increased frequency of such ENSO extremes under greenhouse warming. However, our knowledge of ENSO extremes at the time had been based on events prior to the emergence of the strong 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o which exhibited distinct characteristics from the previous extreme El Ni\u00f1o events. On that regards, how does the 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o offer a new perspective?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMGC42D..05S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
