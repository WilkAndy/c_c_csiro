This article presents a synthesis of current understanding of meteorological drought, with a focus on the large-scale controls on precipitation afforded by sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, land surface feedbacks, and radiative forcings. The synthesis is primarily based on regionally focused articles submitted to the Global Drought Information System (GDIS) collection together with new results from a suite of atmospheric general circulation model experiments intended to integrate those studies into a coherent view of drought worldwide. On interannual time scales, the preeminence of ENSO as a driver of meteorological drought throughout much of the Americas, eastern Asia, Australia, and the Maritime Continent is now well established, whereas in other regions (e.g., Europe \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 172, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14551366563009550084", "cites_id": ["14551366563009550084"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/29/11/jcli-d-15-0452.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BFeu6MrW8MkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 18, "2018": 25, "2019": 20, "2020": 37, "2021": 23, "2022": 34, "2023": 11}}
