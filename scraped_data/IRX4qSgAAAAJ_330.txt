Three strong El Ni\u00f1o events occurred during the 1979-2015 period, the 1982-1983, 1997-1998 and 2015-2016 events, but not all of them were associated with a clear springtime rainfall deficit in eastern Australia. Although spring of 1982 showed an expected significant rainfall deficit over a large portion of eastern Australia, the spring of 1997 resulted in near average rainfall, with 2015 showing only slightly less than average spring rainfall. By many metrics, the El Ni\u00f1o of 1997 is considered to be the strongest in our analysis period, but this did not translate to a strong east Australian teleconnection. It has been speculated that the spring rainfall received during 1997 was the result of atmospheric processes unrelated to sea surface temperatures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..2011618V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
