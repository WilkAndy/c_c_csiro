Studies have suggested that the cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacificmay be partly induced by warming in the North Atlantic. However, it remains unknown how stablethis inter-tropical teleconnection will be under global warming. Here we show that the inter-tropicalteleconnection from the tropical Atlantic to Pacific weakens substantially as the CO2 concentrationincreases. This reduced impact is related to the El Ni\u00f1o-like warming of the tropical Pacific mean state, which leads to limited seasonal migration of the Pacific inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) andweakened ocean heat transport. A fast decay of the tropical Atlantic SST anomalies in a warmer climatealso contributes to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.A43D0266J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
