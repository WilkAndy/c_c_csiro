On shorter timescales, however, modes of natural climate variability in the Pacific, such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can impact regional sea level variability and extremes with considerable impacts on coastal ecosystems and island nations. How these shorter-term sea level fluctuations will change in association with a projected increase in extreme El Ni\u00f1o and its atmospheric variability remains unknown. Using present-generation coupled climate models forced with increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations and subtracting the effect of global mean sea level rise, we find that climate change will enhance El Ni\u00f1o-related sea level extremes, especially in the tropical southwestern Pacific, where very low sea level events, locally known as Taimasa which means foul-smelling tide, are projected to double in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUOSEC33B..07W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
