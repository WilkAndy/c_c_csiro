The rise of ENSO, signified by large changes in ocean and atmospheric circulations, occurs through a suite of Bjerknes coupled feedback processes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Observations over recent decades have seen some peculiar behaviour of ENSO that has challenged our scientific understanding of this remarkable phenomenon. 1982 and 1997 saw the strongest El Nino events in modern records, uniquely characterised by eastward propagating sea surface temperature anomalies, a behaviour not seen during moderate events and La Nina. The impacts were severe, causing multi billion dollars in damages, thousands of human lives lost, and destruction of marine habitats. The 1997 El Nino was followed by an exceptionally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.4935S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
