Despite considerable progress in our understanding of the impact of climate change on many of the processes that contribute to ENSO variability, it is not yet possible to say whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped, or if the frequency of events will change in the coming decades (Vecchi & Wittenberg 2010, Collins et al. 2010). As changes in ENSO have the potential to be one of the largest manifestations of anthropogenic climate change, this status has profound impacts on the reliability of regional attribution of climate variability and change.One major reason for our lack of understanding is that, as ENSO involves a complex interplay of numerous oceanic and atmospheric processes, accurately modelling this climate phenomenon with Coupled Global Climate Models (CGCMs), and understanding, anticipating, and predicting its behaviour on seasonal to decadal and longer time scales still pose formidable challenges (Guilyardi et al. 2009a, Wittenberg 2009)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 164, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5049291452261570812", "cites_id": ["5049291452261570812"], "pub_url": "https://cobblab.eas.gatech.edu/Guilyardi12.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_Jh309KvEkYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 18, "2014": 30, "2015": 24, "2016": 18, "2017": 16, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 14, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
