The state of ocean and atmospheric circulations, and thus climate variability, is dependent upon changes in the ITF which impact on heat and salt balance across the Indo-Pacific oceans. Understanding its variability and link with major drivers of Indo-Pacific climate variability however remains elusive due to limited direct observational data. A multi-model ensemble approach is needed to help bridge this gap. Using 20 models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project fifth instalment (CMIP5), and an ocean reanalysis as a reference, we find that local processes in the Indian Ocean side play a more dominant role on ITF variability than the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This is corroborated by the high inter-model correlation between the variability amplitude of the ITF and that of the zonal winds south of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.5033S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
