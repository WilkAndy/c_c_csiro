Results The observed SST anomalies in the WTP reveal the 2014 record high has occurred in conjunction with a long-term warming in this region since the 1950s. The ALL_P1 ensemble mean and range are consistent with the observed changes with similar trends (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2a), whereas none of CTL_P0 and NAT_P1 trends exceeds the observed trend in the WTP (0.62 C 62 years\u20131), whereas it is 100% exceeded in GHG_P1. Thus, the modeled fraction of risk of the SST trend in the WTP that is attributable to anthropogenic forcing is 100%(FAR= 1) considering a negligible influence of natural forcing. In the NEP, multi-decadal variability results in no significant observed long-term trend, however an increasing long-term trend is simulated more in experiments that include anthropogenic forcings. FAR values for NEP SST trends range from 0.80-0.84, providing evidence that there is about 5 times increase in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE06293935", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_kxoLxJMyXEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
