The 1982/83 and 1997/98 \u201csuper\u2013El Ni\u00f1o\u201d events pose a challenge to this understanding. The 1997/98 event was dubbed \u201cthe climate event of the twentieth century\u201d for its extraordinary magnitude and global-scale destructive effects. Modeling studies over the last 2 years have led to further insights into extreme El Ni\u00f1os and have found that their frequency is projected to increase significantly under greenhouse warming.In boreal spring of 2014, the tropical Pacific was primed for an El Ni\u00f1o, when most forecast agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology elevated their El Ni\u00f1o probability to more than 60%. A remarkable increase in warm water volume with a series of westerly wind bursts in boreal spring alerted ENSO experts to the possibility of a strong event, one which some thought could be the first extreme El Ni\u00f1o since 1997, generating news headlines worldwide. However, while the equatorial Pacific remained anomalously warm, the expected super\u2013El Ni\u00f1o did not materialize. That failed expectation may, in part, be a reflection of our incomplete knowledge of extreme El Ni\u00f1o and its predictability or perhaps the very nature of the ENSO system itself. Against this backdrop of progress, uncertainties, and ensuing greenhouse warming, it is timely to ask\u2014what is the current state of understanding of ENSO diversity, extremes, impacts, and teleconnections? It is for this reason that ENSO researchers gathered in Sydney, Australia, earlier this year \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/43096943.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
