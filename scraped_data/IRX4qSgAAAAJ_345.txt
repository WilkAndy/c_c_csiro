The warming pattern is well captured by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models forced with long-lived greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. While greenhouse gases and aerosols generate offsetting warming and cooling patterns in the Indian Ocean, much less is known about their influence on IOD properties, particularly the negative sea surface temperature (SST) skewness in the eastern IOD (IODE) region. Using single forcing runs from nine CMIP5 models, we show that the SST negative skewness is more enhanced under aerosols than for greenhouse gases and is controlled by the SST response to thermocline variations. This coupling shows substantial asymmetry between warm and cool IODE conditions in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.A51M..05C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
