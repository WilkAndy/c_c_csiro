Such extreme events (referred to in Samoa as' taimasa') expose shallow reefs, thereby damaging associated coastal ecosystems and contributing to the formation of'flat topped coral heads' often referred to as microatolls. We show that during the termination of strong El Ni\u00f1o events, a southward movement of weak trade winds prolongs extreme low sea levels in the southwestern Pacific. Whereas future sea levels are projected to gradually rise, recent modeling evidence suggests that the frequency of strong El Ni\u00f1o events (which alter local trade winds and sea level) is very likely to increase with greenhouse warming. Such changes could exacerbate El Ni\u00f1o-related sea level drops, especially in the tropical southwestern Pacific.
