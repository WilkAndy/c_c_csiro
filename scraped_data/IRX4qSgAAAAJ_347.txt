During strong El Nino events the SPCZ collapses onto the equator which enhances drought conditions for many South Pacific Islands. Resulting wind stress curl changes in turn cause massive sea-level drops of about to 30 cm ('Taimasa'events-Samoan for smelly reef), which further impact Island communities. These so-called zonal SPCZ events emerge through the nonlinear interaction between ENSO and the annual cycle (combination mode). Their effect on zonal equatorial winds has been identified as one of the key terminators for strong El Nino events and as an important seasonal modulator for ENSO. Recent modeling studies have demonstrated that the number of zonal SPCZ events may nearly double in response to greenhouse warming \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.A11B3015T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
