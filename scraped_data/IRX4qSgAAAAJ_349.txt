The key objectives are to understand the Southwest Pacific Ocean circulation and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) dynamics, as well as their influence on regional and basin-scale climate patterns. South Pacific thermocline waters are transported in the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) toward Australia and Papua-New Guinea (Figure 1). On its way, the SEC encounters the numerous islands and straits of the Southwest Pacific and forms boundary currents and jets that eventually redistribute"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.clivar.org/sites/default/files/documents/pan-clivar/pan_clivar_reports/SPICE_for_CLIVAR.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pQHD-dTqSrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
