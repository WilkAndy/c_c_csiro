This cooling has been previously attributed to an anthropogenic aerosol-induced strengthening of the global ocean conveyor, which transfers heat from the subtropical gyre latitudes toward the North Atlantic. From the mid-1990s the sub-thermocline IO experienced a rapid temperature trend reversal. In the context of understanding the causes of the sub-thermocline temperature changes, we use a suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models forced with natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings and as well as individual forcing runs. We use these to:(i) examine whether the sub-thermocline cooling and/or rapid warming of the tropical/subtropical IO is anthropogenic or naturally forced; and (ii) assess future projections of the sub-thermocline \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFMGC51B0954C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
