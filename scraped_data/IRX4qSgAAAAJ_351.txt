Understanding the dynamics is important for seasonal prediction and climate projections, but the role of meridional circulation anomalies remains unclear. Here, we show that the zonal structure of rainfall anomalies results from two processes: despite a weak westward extension of the oceanic tropical convergence zone, anomalously high rainfall over east Africa is driven locally rather than a westward shift of the atmospheric convection from the east; further, northward contraction of the warm water pool over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean region (EEIO), generating changes in the meridional SST gradient, controls the northward retreat of the atmospheric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFMOS41B1823W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
