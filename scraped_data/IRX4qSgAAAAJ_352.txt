The strongest El Ni\u00f1o events in modern record (1982/83 and 1997/98), as characterised most apparently by eastward anomaly propagation, generated drastically different global climatic teleconnections with far-reaching and costly impacts. The cause of this propagation asymmetry, which is most apparent in the post-1976 period, is currently unknown, demonstrating a gap in our understanding of ENSO dynamics. Here we show that this asymmetry arises from the fact that the westward flowing current along the equatorial Pacific is enhanced during La Ni\u00f1a but reversed during extreme El Ni\u00f1o events. We diagnose this mechanism through a heat budget analysis utilising \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.6698S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
