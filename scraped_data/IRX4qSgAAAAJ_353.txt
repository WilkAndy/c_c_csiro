The cause of this asymmetry has not been previously examined. In this study, heat budget analysis conducted using a reanalysis product which spans the 1959-2006 period reveals a mechanism that can give rise to this asymmetry. The asymmetry, which is more apparent in the post-1976 period, is shown to arise from the fact that the westward flowing equatorial Pacific background current is enhanced during La Ni\u00f1a and weakened during El Ni\u00f1o events. This favours more prominent westward advection of anomalous sea surface temperature during La Ni\u00f1a than during El Ni\u00f1o. During the extreme 1982 and 1997 El Ni\u00f1o events the zonal current anomalies are sufficiently strong to reverse the westward background current. Thus, both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFMOS53A1956S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
