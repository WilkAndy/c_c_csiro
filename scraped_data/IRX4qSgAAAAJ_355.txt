Recent studies suggest that the magnitude of the Agulhas Leakage is determined by the strength of the Agulhas current and the latitudinal position of maximum zonal wind stress or zero wind stress curl. Using outputs from 19 CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, two factors mentioned above are verified. In the 20th century, wind stress curl in the Indian Ocean shifts poleward and its strength south of Africa increases but decreases in east coast of Africa. As a result of the change in the wind stress curl, the supergyre circulation shifts southward and strengthens, but the Agulhas Current decreases. Aggregated over the 19 models, there is a good relationship between the global warming rate, especially the warming rate in the Indian Ocean, and the size of the modelled Agulhas leakage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFMOS33C1830W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
