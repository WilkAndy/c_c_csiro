The BJ stability index depends on the basic mean state, the atmosphere's sensitivity to sea surface temperature and the ocean's sensitivity to wind forcing. A positive BJ stability index indicates a growth of ENSO stability while a negative BJ stability index signifies the rate of decay with negative contributions coming from damping by mean advection and air-sea heat fluxes while positive contributions from the zonal advective, Ekman pumping and thermocline feedback. Here we employ the BJ stability index to investigate ENSO variability over multi-decadal time scales in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark version 3.0 L (CSIRO Mk3L) coupled general circulation model and assess the sensitivity of ENSO to changes in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFMOS53A1950B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
