This is particularly so in austral spring, when a strong relationship exists between the IOD and ENSO. ENSO is known to influence global climate via tropical and extratropical responses to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. These anomalies induce an equatorially trapped baroclinic response in the atmosphere, generating anomalous vertical motions in the tropical Pacific. These vertical motions cause convection and pressure responses, manifested as the Southern Oscillation. The convection leads to anomalous divergence in the upper troposphere, which acts as a source of Rossby waves. These waves are equivalent-barotropic and propagate into the higher latitudes over the Pacific Ocean and South America \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFMOS43G..02V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
