This year's conference included a workshop on Indo\u2010Pacific climate variability and change that focused on interactions between the two ocean basins, their teleconnections, and how these might change in the future. There were 16 presentations by participants, which are now available at http://www.greenhouse2011.com/page.aspx?docid=11. Several talks at the workshop identified feedback mechanisms that control the development and structure of climate modes, using both observations and Coupled Model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011EO310004", "cites_per_year": {}}
