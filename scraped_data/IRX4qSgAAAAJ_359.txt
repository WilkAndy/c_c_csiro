Comparisons are made for different latitude bands, timescales, and temperature variables, using information from a multi-model archive and a variety of observational datasets. Our focus is on temperature changes in the lower troposphere (TLT), the mid-to upper troposphere (TMT), and at the sea surface (SST). For SST, TLT, and TMT, trend comparisons over the satellite era (1979 to 2009) always yield closest agreement in mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. There are pronounced discrepancies in the tropics and in the Southern Hemisphere: in both regions, the multi-model average warming is consistently larger than observed. At high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the observed tropospheric warming exceeds multi-model average trends. The similarity in the latitudinal structure of this discrepancy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFMNG23D..02S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
