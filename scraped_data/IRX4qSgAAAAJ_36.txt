Of particular interest is the global ocean circulation associated with the Atlantic meridional overturning (AMOC). Because observations are sparse, the detailed global structure of the AMOC remains poorly understood, particularly the pathways along which water returns to the Atlantic to compensate the export of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). Here we provide the first quantitative 3\u2010dimensional global view of the AMOC using a Lagrangian reconstruction which integrates hundred of thousands water particle trajectories in an ocean model. The resulting pattern elucidates the role of the wind in structuring the pathways of the AMOC. In particular, the Lagrangian analysis reveals a strong link with the three subtropical gyres of the southern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 158, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14555666606971574500", "cites_id": ["14555666606971574500"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007GL031583", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5FiO6agdAMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 13, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 13, "2018": 18, "2019": 19, "2020": 5, "2021": 10, "2022": 11, "2023": 8}}
