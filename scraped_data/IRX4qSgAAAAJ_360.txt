This is possibly due to the models overestimating the oceanic cooling influence of the indirect aerosol effect. Volcanic forcing alone cannot account for the weaker modelled OHC trends. The models results support the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosols are critically important for simulating the structure of the observed temperature change in the Southern Hemisphere; this change is strongest in the midlatitude band 35-50 S, and are associated with a Sverdrup-like response to poleward strengthening winds and a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere supergyre of about 1. The heat required for this midlatitude warming is mostly derived from surface heat fluxes from south of 50 S, which is advected northward by enhanced Ekman transport induced by the poleward-strengthening winds. These results may, however, be significantly altered in eddy-resolving models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=d671273b58df990930a0b74222ef903ca4c1d575#page=89", "cites_per_year": {}}
