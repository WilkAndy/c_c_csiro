These consecutive pIODs contributed to the prolonged drought (termed the \u201cBig Dry\u201d) over southeastern Australia (SEA), preceding the devastating \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d bushfires near Melbourne that killed over 170 people and devastated many communities. Is the recent high frequency of pIOD events a consequence of global warming? Is there a linkage between recent major bushfires over SEA and the recent skewness toward more frequent positive events? From available observations and reanalyses, there has been a pIOD frequency increase from about four per 30 years early in the 20th century to about 10 over the last 30 years (Cai et al. 2009a). By contrast, the number of negative Indian Ocean Dipole (nIOD) events (that are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP107106&sb=RECENT&n=7&rpp=50&page=41&tr=5490&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
