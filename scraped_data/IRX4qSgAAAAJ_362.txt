Its intensity and destruction bore many similarities to the \u2018\u2018Ash Wednesday\u2019\u2019bushfires in February 1983, which killed close to 50 people in Victoria and destroyed over 2000 homes. A commonality of these two major bushfire events was that they were both preceded by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) occurrence. Typically, a pIOD is associated with a reduction in rainfall over southeast Australia in the austral spring season, leading to higher temperatures and increasing the fuel load leading into summer (dry season) through lowering soil moisture levels. Since 1950, there have been 16 pIOD events (of which three occurred consecutively in 2006-2008), 11 of which were followed by a major bushfire event (Cai et al. 2009a). pIODs are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP107111&sb=RECENT&n=9&rpp=10&page=231&tr=5468&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
