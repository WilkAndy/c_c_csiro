This has been observed through an increase in the oceanic heat content (OHC) which describes the depth integrated temperature change. The OHC trend displays a maximum value (ie. warming) in the midlatitude band stretching from 35\u00b0-50\u00b0S. However, this warming pattern is unable to be accounted for by changes in local heat fluxes. It is associated with a Sverdrup-like response to poleward strengthening winds and a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere supergyre and Antarctic Circumpolar Current of almost 1\u00b0. The heat required for this midlatitude warming is mostly derived from surface heat fluxes from south of 50\u00b0S, which is advected northward by enhanced Ekman transport induced by the poleward-strengthening winds. These results highlight the relationship between winds and surface heat fluxes in Southern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5603876/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j3lq2ivw7jAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
