This generates a greater poleward shift and intensification of the Agulhas outflow and its retroflection; this process increases the warming rate in the subtropics, and takes heat out of off-equatorial regions generating a cooling. As a result of this poleward shift of the Agulhas, maximum sea surface temperature gradients, mid-latitude storms and the westerly jet shift southward, intensifying the trend of the southern annular mode. These atmospheric circulation responses, in turn, reinforce the ocean circulation changes, constituting an air\u2013sea positive feedback. These results illustrate how northern hemisphere aerosols impact on the southern hemisphere atmospheric circulation trends through a response in ocean circulation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WweaWERxDGMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&dq=info:cyCj-Gybbg4J:scholar.google.com&ots=IWhNSHf3KQ&sig=xn1ois9Iq67mvzwGHkzscOnufgc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cyCj-Gybbg4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
