If this increasing rainfall trend continues, it could be an important future water resource for Australia. However, most climate models, used for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4), project a future rainfall reduction over the region. This means that a substantial reduction has to commence to reverse the current trend. Is such a result believable?  Do models even produce the observed trend and correct teleconnection patterns with known climate drivers?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.usq.edu.au/item/9z9y4/do-ipcc-ar4-models-produce-the-rainfall-increase-over-northwest-australia", "cites_per_year": {}}
