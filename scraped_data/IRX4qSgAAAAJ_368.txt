In terms of zonal sea surface temperature(SST) gradients such a warming pattern is reminiscent of that during a pIOD event, a phase of variability in which the eastern IO is cooler, and the western IO is warmer, than normal. Given that global warming has been proceeding, is there a signature in the mean-circulation that supports such a projection? Are there any consistent changes in the IOD properties? In recent years, there has been an apparent increase in the occurrence of pIOD events. During 2006-2008, the IO experienced an unprecedented occurrence of three consecutive pIOD episodes. These recent events appear to support the notion of multi-decadal fluctuations of IOD properties, and the more recent finding that since 1880 the occurrences of pIOD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5936487586882991876&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
