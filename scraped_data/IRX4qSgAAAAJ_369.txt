Over the short term, these findings do not fundamentally change our approach to managing greater Sydney\u2019s water supply; however they do highlight the importance of:      managing risk by having an appropriate buffer between supply and demand     having an understanding of the likely pressure points on the supply and demand balance in the future      having the ability to respond to changing conditions due to both climate change and climate variability     continuing to improve our knowledge of climate change impacts on greater Sydney\u2019s water supply and incorporating this knowledge into future iterations of the Metropolitan Water Plan.  Findings from the Sydney Water Balance Project also indicate that climate change:      will likely result \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2642365588549321271&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
