We show that the reduction is not simulated by the majority of current climate models forced with climate change, nor in experiments with individual anthropogenic forcing factors.We then examine a possible contribution from natural variability, and find that El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a rainfall-generating mechanism for the region because of an asymmetry in the ENSO impact. The associated La Ni\u00f1a events induce a statistically significant increase in rainfall in SEQ and the stronger the La Ni\u00f1a event, the more the rainfall produced. El Ni\u00f1o events bring reduced rainfall to SEQ. However, there is no statistically significant relationship between the magnitude of the El Ni\u00f1o event and the amount of rainfall reduction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.urbanwateralliance.org.au/publications/UWSRA-tr18.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YnEQdAPScPEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
