The warming penetrates to a depth of 800 m, in contrast to the off-equatorial surface warming which coexists with subsurface cooling. Outputs from two targeted ensemble sets of coupled model experiments, one with and one without increasing anthropogenic aerosols, show that increasing aerosols strengthen the globally interconnected ocean current system associated with the Atlantic overturning, inducing a pan-oceanic heat redistribution. This generates a greater poleward shift and intensification of the Agulhas outflow and its retroflection; the process increases the warming rate in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/b75a743593d7414d9c6f6e274da30d89/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=4998669", "cites_per_year": {}}
