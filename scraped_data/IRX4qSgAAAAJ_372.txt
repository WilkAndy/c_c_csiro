A good measure of the warming is an increase in the oceanic heat content, which displays considerable spatial differences, with a maximum in the 35 S-50 S mid-latitude band. The relative importance of forcings from wind changes and surface heat flux trends are the subject of much debate. Using wind, oceanic temperature and heat flux outputs from multi-model 20th century experiments conducted for the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we show that the fast warming over the 35 S-50 S latitude band is unable to be accounted for by local heat flux changes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/e7a42eacdb8f8d4845d5ba2bc2bdefbd/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=4998669", "cites_per_year": {}}
