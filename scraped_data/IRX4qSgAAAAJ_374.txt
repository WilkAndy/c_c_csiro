In these regions which only occur in the tropics, significant releases of kinetic energy (KE) into the atmosphere from the ocean mixed layer due to convective instability give rise to warm core systems which may develop into intense TCs. The monthly mean histograms of H evaluated from reanalysis and SST data and averaged over the period 1979-2005 for three generation regions (the West Pacific, the Atlantic and the East Pacific) show a remarkable symmetrical pattern in which the standard deviation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-09410-6_6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pCAmBd4WZzUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
