Indeed, in 2006-2007 two consecutive pIOD events occurred in conjunction with a 2007 La Ni\u00f1a event causing wide-spread drought across eastern Australia. Significant improvements have been achieved in the simulation of Indo-Pacific variability, such as the IOD and the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR4). In this paper, we discuss the dynamics behind Australian seasonal rainfall teleconnections associated with two-consecutive pIOD events and with one occurring in a La Ni\u00f1a year, using outputs from IPCC-AR4 climate models. The results show that only six out of 24 models produce at least one such combinations during the latter part of their 20th Century simulation, and that the associated evolution of rainfall anomalies are reasonably simulated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Cowan/publication/255614068_How_well_do_IPCC-AR4_models_simulate_Australian_rainfall_teleconnections_during_two-consecutive_positive_Indian_Ocean_dipole_events/links/02e7e53b9dc9bb6b99000000/How-well-do-IPCC-AR4-models-simulate-Australian-rainfall-teleconnections-during-two-consecutive-positive-Indian-Ocean-dipole-events.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vS_vLj3FnMIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
