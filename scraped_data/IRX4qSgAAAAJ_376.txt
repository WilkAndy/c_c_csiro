As winter comes, the ridge of high-pressure moves northward and passes beyond the southern tip of Western Australia, allowing low-pressure systems to also move northward, bringing rainfall to the region. Interannual variations in this seasonal cycle is controlled by the SAM. A SAM-SWWA relationship exists in winter and not in other seasons. What seems to be happening is that, on average, this ridge of high-pressure is not moving as far north as in earlier decades of the 20th century. The ensemble result from the 71 experiments reveals that anthropogenic forcing"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Upmanu-Lall/publication/222798781_Probabilistic_Multivariate_Forecasting_of_Reservoir_Inflows_using_Independent_Component_Analysis/links/09e4151007fc5cac34000000/Probabilistic-Multivariate-Forecasting-of-Reservoir-Inflows-using-Independent-Component-Analysis.pdf#page=21", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xg9ZKa-sSmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
