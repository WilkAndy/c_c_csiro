The warming penetrates to a depth of 5 800m, in contrast to the off-equatorial surface warming 6 which co-exists with subsurface cooling. We examine the 7 dynamics for this rich structure. Results from the 20th 8 century experiments of the Intergovernmental Panel for 9 Climate Change (IPCC) confirm that the southern sub-10 tropical IO surface-to-800m warming is greater than that 11 in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Outputs from two tar-12 geted ensemble sets of coupled model experiments, one 13 with and one without increasing anthropogenic aerosols, 14 show that increasing aerosols strengthen the global Con-15 veyor, and generate a greater poleward shift and intensi-16 fication of the Agulhas outflow and its retroflection; the 17 process increases the warming rate in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2157386549967299875&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I6UBCqOT8B0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
