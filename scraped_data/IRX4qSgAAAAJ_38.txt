The ongoing drought has placed immense pressure on the limited water resources and a perception that this may be the start of a persistent change from historical conditions. Several studies have suggested that part of the current drought could be associated with global warming, and many global climate model projections for southeast Australia are for a drier future on average. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate a global warming signal from the high natural variability observed over the last two centuries and revealed in palaeo-climate records.Historically, water resources planning have considered past climate variability over different timescales together with impacts of other drivers of water availability. Currently, projections of future climate are highly uncertain and they are best treated as multiple plausible futures.
