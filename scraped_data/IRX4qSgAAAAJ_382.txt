These observations also favor the argument that continental shelves are autotrophic (ie, net production of organic carbon, OC). The US South Atlantic Bight (SAB) contrasts these findings in that it acts as a strong source of CO2 to the atmosphere while simultaneously exporting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the open ocean. We report pCO2, DIC, and alkalinity data from the SAB collected in 8 cruises along a transect from the shore to the shelf break in the central SAB. The shelf-wide net heterotrophy and carbon exports in the SAB are subsidized by the export of OC from the abundant intertidal marshes, which are a sink for atmospheric CO2. It is proposed here that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFMOS22D..03C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
