METHODS: cDNA fragments responding to ischemia and reperfusion in porcine myocardium were isolated by mRNA differential display and then the cDNA library from porcine heart was screened. After cloning, sequencing, and hybridization, the basic characteristics of the gene were analyzed. RESULTS: One cDNA fragment from a novel gene up-regulated by ischemia and reperfusion was identified and cloned subsequently; a novel full-length cDNA containing an open reading frame encoding 608 amino acid was obtained by screening the library. Sequencing results revealed that both DNA and amino acid sequences had no substantial homology to previously described DNA or protein sequences. Northern blot analysis confirmed that this gene expression in ischemia and reperfusion myocardium was significantly increased, and the expression was also able to be detected in normal porcine heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, intestine, brain, and skeletal muscle. Southern blot analysis clearly showed that this novel gene had high evolutional conservation in human beings, pigs, rabbits, and mice. CONCLUSION: The cloned gene is a novel one induced by ischemia and reperfusion, and it may play a very important role in the response to ischemia and reperfusion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/12536481", "cites_per_year": {}}
