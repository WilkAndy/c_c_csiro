No matter the different appearance, they are based on the same dynamical sophistication: geostrophy, hydrostatic, and potential density (\u03c1) conservation (Davis, 1978). The current inverse methods are all based on two conservation principles: potential density and potential vorticity (q= f\u2202 \u03c1/\u2202 z) and require \u03b2-turning. Thus, two necessary conditions can be incorporated into any inverse methods:(1) non-coincidence of potential density and potential vorticity surfaces and (2) existence of vertical turning of the velocity (\u03b2-turning.) This can be done using the P-Vector, a unit vector in the direction of\u2207 \u03c1\u00d7\u2207 q (Chu, 1994, 1995). The first necessary condition becomes the existence of the P-vector, and the second necessary condition leads to the existence of the P-vector turning in the water column. Along this line, we developed the P-vector inverse method with a pre-requirement check-up. The method was verified in this study using the Modular Ocean Model (MOM) from Pacanowski et al.(1991) version of Bryan-Cox-Semtner ocean general circulation model (OGCM), which is based on the work of Bryan (1969). The statistically steady solutions of temperature and salinity from MOM are used as a \u201cno-error data\u201d set for computing absolute geostrophic velocities by the P-vector inverse method. Circulations are similar between the MOM statistically steady solutions and the P-vector solutions.
