Observations of Australian rainfall and cloudiness since 1950 show increases over much of the continent. We show that including anthropogenic aerosol changes in 20th century simulations of a global climate model gives increasing rainfall and cloudiness over Australia during 1951\u20131996, whereas omitting this forcing gives decreasing rainfall and cloudiness. The pattern of increasing rainfall when aerosols are included is strongest over northwestern Australia, in agreement with the observed trends. The strong impact of aerosols is primarily due to the massive Asian aerosol haze, as confirmed by a sensitivity test in which only Asian anthropogenic aerosols are included. The Asian haze alters the meridional temperature and pressure gradients over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5860996146787061868", "cites_id": ["5860996146787061868"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JD007712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bBAtT_FwVlEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 13, "2008": 7, "2009": 18, "2010": 17, "2011": 16, "2012": 17, "2013": 13, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
