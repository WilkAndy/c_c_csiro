Outputs from the SODA-POP reanalysis (Version 1.4. 2), showing correlation between Nino3. 4 and gridpoint D20 at various lags with a 3-month interval. Positive correlations imply deeper depths, and negative lags mean the Nino3. 4 lags. Left column is for the post-1980 and right column for the pre-1980 period. A value of 0.28 indicates statistical significance at 95% confidence level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/49919990/Multidecadal_variability_in_the_transmis20161027-19394-40mgvc.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M7U1igX22O0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
