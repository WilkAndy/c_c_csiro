The robustness of a CP El Ni\u00f1o preconditioning a strong pIOD has not been investigated. Here we show that March-April-May (MAM) easterly anomalies over the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) induced by a preceding CP El Ni\u00f1o drive a thermocline shallowing conducive to an early equatorial EIO cooling. However, the same winds also generate off-equatorial downwelling Rossby waves in the southern EIO, which reflect as downwelling Kelvin waves, able to weaken the initial anomalies. Further, zonal winds in June-July-August (JJA) can either be beneficial or unfavourable for the developing pIOD. Only when the equatorial easterlies, EIO cooling, and thermocline shallowing are sufficiently amplified by JJA does a strong pIOD occur. Despite this, a multi-century model simulation suggests that development \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11454362137683095242&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yu5IKa0R9p4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
