By contrast, there has been an increase over northwest Australia (NWA) in austral summer, which, if continues, could be an important future water resource. If increasing anthropogenic aerosols contribute to the observed increasing summer rainfall trend, then as anthropogenic aerosols are projected to decrease what will the likely impact be on NWA summer rainfall? This study uses outputs from 24 climate models submitted to phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) with a total of 75 experiments to provide a multi-model perspective. The authors find that none of the ensemble averages, either with both the direct and indirect anthropogenic aerosol effect (10 models, 32 experiments), or with only the direct effect (14 models, 43 experiments), simulate the observed NWA rainfall increase. Given this, it follows that a projected rainfall reduction is not due to a projected decline in future aerosol concentrations. The authors show that the projected NWA rainfall reduction is associated with an unrealistic and overly strong NWA rainfall teleconnection with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The unrealistic teleconnection is primarily caused by a model Equatorial Pacific cold tongue that extends too far into the western Pacific, with the ascending branch of the Walker circulation situated too far west, exerting an influence on rainfall over NWA rather than over northeast Australia. Models with a greater present-day ENSO amplitude produce a greater reduction in the Walker \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joachim_Ribbe/publication/273199996_Are_Anthropogenic_Aerosols_Responsible_for_the_Northwest_Australia_Summer_Rainfall_Increase_A_CMIP3_Perspective_and_Implications/links/55cee6cb08aee19936fc5ec4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SMLyQkeWjxMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
