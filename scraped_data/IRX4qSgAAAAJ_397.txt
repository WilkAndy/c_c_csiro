A multiscale analysis is neccessary to account for numerous islands and thin, strong currents that are able to transport large amounts of heat and freshwater rapidely over long distances. Model types include (Figure below) operational (Bluelink, Mercator); global coupled (IPCC-IR4); oceanic forced (OFES/ORCA) and nested models (ROMS)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=e8f2771d2e1bf81394c9481854f9eaf5a692ec49", "cites_per_year": {}}
