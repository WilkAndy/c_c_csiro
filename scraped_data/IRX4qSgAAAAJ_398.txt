We have carried out the 7-month ensemble forecast initiated at the end of January, April, July and October in the 28 years from 1979 to 2006, as a part of the TFSP retrospective seasonal forecast experiment. From the verification of the preliminary 5-member ensemble forecast experiment, it is found that the anomaly correlation of monthly mean SST in Nino3. 4 (Nino3) region is 0.75 (0.69) to 6 months lead. These forecast skills surpass current operational model's skills, and show validity as the ENSO forecast model. SST forecast in the tropical Western Pacific region (130W-150E, 0-15E), in which SSTs influence the northern summer extratropical circulation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6377707617991420371&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:02muu0krglgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
