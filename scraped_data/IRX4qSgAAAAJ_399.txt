The decline is manifest as a reduction of high-intensity extreme rainfall events. There has been vigorous debate as to what is forcing the drying trend, ie, whether it is driven by secular forcings such as increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration or whether it is part of multidecadal variability. Previous results from greenhouse warming experiments suggest that the SWWA rainfall shows a drying trend with an increasing mid-latitude mean sea level pressure (MSLP) under increasing atmospheric CO2, which is expressed as an upward trend of a dominant atmospheric circulation mode of the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). We present our recent results on statistical modeling of winter extreme rainfall over SWWA and its associated changes with the AAO. The possibility of the rainfall reduction being a part of multidecadal variability was discussed by using outputs of the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model in an experiment without CO2 forcing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://archytas.birs.ca/workshops/2010/10w5016/files/SWWA%20rainfall%20extreme%20change%20Yun%20Li%20[Read-Only].pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m3VV8JP2PsMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
