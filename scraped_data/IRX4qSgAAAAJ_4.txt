Under the influence of global warming, the mean climate of the Pacific region will probably undergo significant changes. The tropical easterly trade winds are expected to weaken; surface ocean temperatures are expected to warm fastest near the equator and more slowly farther away; the equatorial thermocline that marks the transition between the wind-mixed upper ocean and deeper layers is expected to shoal; and the temperature gradients across the thermocline are expected to become steeper. Year-to-year ENSO variability is controlled by a delicate balance of amplifying and damping feedbacks, and one or more of the physical processes that are responsible for determining the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1271, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14488479260448595177", "cites_id": ["14488479260448595177"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo868", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Rynxh9rEckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 10, "2011": 53, "2012": 81, "2013": 122, "2014": 125, "2015": 121, "2016": 91, "2017": 114, "2018": 101, "2019": 95, "2020": 116, "2021": 101, "2022": 87, "2023": 38}}
