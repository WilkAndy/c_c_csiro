The tropical teleconnection is understood as the equatorially-trapped, deep baroclinic response to the diabatic (convective) heating anomalies induced by the tropical SST anomalies. The same diabatic heating anomalies that drive the tropical teleconnection also excite equivalent barotropic Rossby wavetrains that propagate into the extratropics. The main direct tropical teleconnection during ENSO is the Southern Oscillation (SO), whose impact on Australian rainfall is argued to be mainly confined to near-tropical portions of eastern Australia. Rainfall is suppressed during El Nino because near-tropical eastern Australia directly experiences sinking motion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12958155324595946160&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sMLgypyd1LMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
