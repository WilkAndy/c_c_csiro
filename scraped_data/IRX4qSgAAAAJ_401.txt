The recent Qingdao Global Ocean Summit offers an effective mechanism for a coherent institutional response to emerging scientific and societal drivers, and for promoting the capacity building in developing economies that is essential for increasing the value and broadening the funding base of the observation system.Approximately 93% of the additional heat associated with global warming is stored in the ocean1, and recent discoveries show that an enhanced heat storage in the subsurface ocean over the past decades contributed to the global surface warming hiatus2-5. These highlight the importance of ocean observations in understanding, monitoring and detecting global climate change. Ocean observations, the \u2018bread and butter\u2019of climate change science, are predominantly conducted by ocean research institutions. However, these endeavors are rarely discussed, let alone organized or coordinated across institutions. Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides an effective mechanism to review and assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information, there is no mechanism for identification of observations that are critically needed, or for coordination of observations that are being made or planned. The absence of such a mechanism represents an impediment to the realization of the full value of the investment in ocean research, and is detrimental to the establishment of a sustainable global ocean observation system.
