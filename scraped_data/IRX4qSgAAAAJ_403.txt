Shown are for a GMT, b ENSO, and c the SAM, using detrended observational data over a 31-year period centred at 1988 (see main text for data sources). The anomalies are calculated by regressing detrended grid-point anomalies onto a detrended index, and then multiplying the one-standard deviation value of the index. Areas confined by the purple contours indicate a statistical significance at the 95% confidence level using Student\u2019s t test."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/f79741c5-bdd6-4d63-8d43-f4aa33e084e5/PubMedCentral/f79741c5-bdd6-4d63-8d43-f4aa33e084e5.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LXO4cgqBFE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
