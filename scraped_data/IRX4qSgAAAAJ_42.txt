The rainfall reduction coincides with a poleward expansion of the tropical belt and subtropical dry zone by around 2\u20133 in the same season. This has raised questions as to whether the regional rainfall reductions are attributable to this poleward expansion. Here we show that the impact of the poleward subtropical dry-zone shift is not longitudinally uniform: a clear shift occurs south of Africa and across southern Australia, but there is no evidence of a poleward shift in the southern Chilean sector. As such, a poleward shift of climatological April-May rainfall can explain most of the southeastern Australia rainfall decline, a small portion of the southern Africa rainfall trend, but not the autumn drying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12147389559753295383", "cites_id": ["12147389559753295383"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/srep00702.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F0Zi6XEylKgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 16, "2015": 8, "2016": 16, "2017": 19, "2018": 18, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 6}}
