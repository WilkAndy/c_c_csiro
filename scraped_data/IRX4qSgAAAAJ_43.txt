In this Review, we synthesize advances in observed and projected changes of multiple aspects of ENSO, including the processes behind such changes. As in previous syntheses, there is an inter-model consensus of an increase in future ENSO rainfall variability. Now, however, it is apparent that models that best capture key ENSO dynamics also tend to project an increase in future ENSO sea surface temperature variability and, thereby, ENSO magnitude under greenhouse warming, as well as an eastward shift and intensification of ENSO-related atmospheric teleconnections \u2014 the Pacific\u2013North American and Pacific\u2013South American patterns. Such projected changes are consistent with palaeoclimate evidence of stronger \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:DkZNVXde3BIC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7175437085966875306", "cites_id": ["7175437085966875306"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00199-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qjo4OQNGlGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 80, "2023": 53}}
