The key objectives are to understand the Southwest Pacific Ocean circulation and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) dynamics, as well as their influence on regional and basin\u2010scale climate patterns. South Pacific thermocline waters are transported in the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) toward Australia and Papua\u2010New Guinea. On its way, the SEC encounters the numerous islands and straits of the Southwest Pacific and forms boundary currents and jets that eventually redistribute water to the equator and high latitudes. The transit in the Coral, Solomon, and Tasman Seas is of great importance to the climate system because changes in either the temperature or the amount of water arriving at the equator have the capability to modulate the El \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7072356861127208255", "cites_id": ["7072356861127208255"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013JC009678", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P61IIBgPJmIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 17, "2016": 18, "2017": 14, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 19, "2021": 7, "2022": 16, "2023": 10}}
