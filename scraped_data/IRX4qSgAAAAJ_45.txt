However, it is not clear whether this impact pathway is symmetric about the positive and negative phases of ENSO and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). It is shown that a strong asymmetry does exist. For ENSO, only the impact from El Ni\u00f1o is conducted through the TIO pathway; the impact from La Ni\u00f1a is delivered through the Pacific\u2013South America pattern. For the IOD, a greater convection anomaly and wave train response occurs during positive IOD (pIOD) events than during negative IOD (nIOD) events. This \u201cimpact asymmetry\u201d is consistent with the positive skewness of the IOD, principally due to a negative skewness of sea surface temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 140, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5509827779136537965", "cites_id": ["5509827779136537965"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/25/18/jcli-d-11-00501.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bUUDPSzXdkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 14, "2018": 18, "2019": 14, "2020": 18, "2021": 13, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
