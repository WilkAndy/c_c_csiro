Despite decades of research, its behaviour continues to challenge scientists. In the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the anomalously cool sea surface temperatures (SSTs) found during La Ni\u00f1a events and the warm waters of modest El Ni\u00f1o events both propagate westwards, as in the seasonal cycle. In contrast, SST anomalies propagate eastwards during extreme El Ni\u00f1o events, prominently in the post-1976 period,,,, spurring unusual weather events worldwide with costly consequences,,,,. The cause of this propagation asymmetry is currently unknown. Here we trace the cause of the asymmetry to the variations in upper ocean currents in the equatorial Pacific, whereby the westward-flowing currents are enhanced during La Ni\u00f1a events but reversed during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 137, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15593787832189737809", "cites_id": ["15593787832189737809"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12683", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UVt6-GlDaNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 14, "2015": 28, "2016": 13, "2017": 18, "2018": 10, "2019": 16, "2020": 11, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 7}}
