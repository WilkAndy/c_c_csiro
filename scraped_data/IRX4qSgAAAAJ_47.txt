Although the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) provides the main source of seasonal climate predictability for many parts of the Earth, the mechanisms of its connection to the East Asian monsoon remain largely elusive. For instance, the traditional Ni\u00f1o3.4 ENSO index only captures precipitation anomalies over East Asia in boreal winter but not during the summer. Here we show that there exists a robust year\u2010round and predictable relationship between ENSO and the Asian monsoon. This connection is revealed by combining equatorial (Ni\u00f1o3.4) and off\u2010equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies (Ni\u00f1o\u2010A index) into a new metric that captures ENSO's various aspects, such as its interaction with the annual cycle and its different flavors.
