In most models, IOD peak\u2010season amplitudes are systematically larger than that of the observed, a bias that deterministically affects climate projections in IOD\u2010affected regions. Understanding the cause of this bias is therefore essential for alleviating model errors and reducing uncertainty in climate projections. Here it is shown that most Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Three (CMIP3) and CMIP5 models produce too strong a Bjerknes feedback in the equatorial Indian Ocean, leading to the IOD bias. The thermocline\u2010sea surface temperature (SST) feedback exerts the strongest influence on the simulated IOD amplitude; models simulating a stronger thermocline\u2010SST feedback systematically generate a greater IOD amplitude \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4712478770103746855", "cites_id": ["4712478770103746855"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/grl.50208", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J4GaP3kWZkEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 16, "2016": 11, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 16, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
