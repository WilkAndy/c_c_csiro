When compared with CMIP3 models, the ENSO amplitudes and the ENSO stability as estimated by the BJ index in the CMIP5 models are more converged around the observed, estimated from the atmosphere and ocean reanalysis data sets. The reduced diversity among models in the simulated ENSO stability can be partly attributed to the reduced spread of the thermocline feedback and Ekman feedback terms among the models. However, a systematic bias persists from CMIP3 to CMIP5. In other words, the majority of the CMIP5 models analyzed in this study still underestimate the zonal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13639528430743024428", "cites_id": ["13639528430743024428"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1833-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LHNHqtdWSb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 17, "2019": 20, "2020": 17, "2021": 16, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
