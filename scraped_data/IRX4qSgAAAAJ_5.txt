Such conditions are accompanied by changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, affecting global climate, marine and terrestrial ecosystems, fisheries and human activities. The alternation of warm El Ni\u00f1o and cold La Ni\u00f1a conditions, referred to as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), represents the strongest year-to-year fluctuation of the global climate system. Here we provide a synopsis of our current understanding of the spatio-temporal complexity of this important climate mode and its influence on the Earth system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 674, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6925808771388453420", "cites_id": ["6925808771388453420"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0252-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LLLkEGJqHWAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 12, "2019": 104, "2020": 155, "2021": 156, "2022": 164, "2023": 79}}
