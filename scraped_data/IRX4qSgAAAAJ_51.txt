However, studies on Australian climate extremes associated with natural climate variability remain limited. This study examines the observed impact of natural climate variability on inter\u2010annual changes in seasonal extremes of rainfall and temperature over Australia during 1957\u20132010. We use non\u2010stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis, where GEV parameters are specified as a linear function of modes of climate variability, and compare results with the case when climate variability is not considered. Results from two station\u2010based observational data sets consistently suggest that extreme responses overall resemble mean responses to climate variability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5921070101120258440", "cites_id": ["5921070101120258440"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/JGRD.50164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iJF1w-LdK1IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 11, "2015": 7, "2016": 15, "2017": 7, "2018": 15, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 20, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
