The regional summer rainfall is affected by the El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, but modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). What does the recent flood tell about the status of the PDO\u2010IPO? Using three lines of supporting evidence it is proposed that the SEQ 2011 austral summer rain constitutes a confirmation of a transition to a negative phase of the PDO\u2010IPO. Firstly, the 2011 summer saw large SEQ rainfall and SOI values that historically occur only in a negative PDO\u2010IPO phase; secondly, there was an associated re\u2010establishment of an ENSO\u2010SEQ rainfall teleconnection; and finally, the decadal\u2010circulation state, particularly the tropical convection, has developed toward a state similar to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8141770144858837104", "cites_id": ["8141770144858837104"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011gl050820", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cBAxT89g_XAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 18, "2014": 17, "2015": 12, "2016": 14, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 13, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
