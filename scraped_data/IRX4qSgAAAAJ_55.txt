The model is based on the GFDL code. Results are presented from a series of model runs where the subsurface mixing parameterization is sequentially upgraded toward a more physical representation. The surface forcing is the same for all principal model runs and features a strong relaxation of surface temperature and salinity toward perpetual wintertime observed values. One model version is rerun with a full annual cycle of surface forcing and verifies that use of the perpetual winter surface relaxation introduces only minor biases in the essential characteristics of the solution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14636183893706909897", "cites_id": ["14636183893706909897"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/24/6/1520-0485_1994_024_1256_soawog_2_0_co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yaixm7QrHssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 6, "1996": 7, "1997": 10, "1998": 8, "1999": 17, "2000": 6, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
