Its response to greenhouse warming has challenged scientists for decades, despite model agreement on projected changes in mean state. Recent studies have provided new insights into the elusive links between changes in ENSO and in the mean state of the Pacific climate. The projected slow-down in Walker circulation is expected to weaken equatorial Pacific Ocean currents, boosting the occurrences of eastward-propagating warm surface anomalies that characterize observed extreme El Ni\u00f1o events. Accelerated equatorial Pacific warming, particularly in the east, is expected to induce extreme rainfall in the eastern equatorial Pacific and extreme equatorward swings of the Pacific convergence zones, both of which are features of extreme El Ni\u00f1o. The frequency of extreme La Ni\u00f1a is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 673, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2907353764868251494", "cites_id": ["2907353764868251494"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2743", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Zt9dZ9j-WCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 8, "2016": 36, "2017": 80, "2018": 95, "2019": 107, "2020": 106, "2021": 113, "2022": 85, "2023": 34}}
