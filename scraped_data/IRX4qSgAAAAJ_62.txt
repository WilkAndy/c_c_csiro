The understanding of SEA autumn rainfall variability, the causes, and associated mechanisms for the autumn reduction remain elusive. As such, a new plausible mechanism for SEA autumn rainfall variability is described, and the dynamics for the reduction are hypothesized. First, there is no recent coherence between SEA autumn rainfall and the southern annular mode, discounting it as a possible driver of the autumn rainfall reduction. Second, weak trends in the subtropical ridge intensity cannot explain the recent autumn rainfall reduction across SEA, even though a significant relationship exists between the ridge and rainfall in April and May. With a collapse in the relationship between the autumn subtropical ridge \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11683834634697839233", "cites_id": ["11683834634697839233"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/1/jcli-d-12-00035.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gRKSV7JRJaIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 11, "2021": 15, "2022": 10, "2023": 5}}
