The latter encompasses significant Asian and non\u2010Asian sources, but their relative roles in forcing historical global and regional monsoon trends are largely unexplored. Using targeted 20th century coupled climate simulations, designed to isolate the impact from anthropogenic aerosols, we show that Asian aerosols induce a weak suppression of global summer monsoon, confined to the East Asian region. The addition of non\u2010Asian aerosols generates an enhancement and broadening of cooler temperatures over Europe and Asia relative to the ambient oceans, supporting stronger northerly flows that further suppress Asian monsoon rainfall. Furthermore, atmospheric convection is directed away from the Asian monsoon regions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16720185285925629022", "cites_id": ["16720185285925629022"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011GL047268", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XmxPIu4HCugJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 16, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
