Modes of variability in the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) field of the following three experiments are examined: 1) a coupled experiment, in which the atmosphere and the ocean are fully coupled, producing El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles and allowing full air\u2013sea interactions; 2) a mixed layer experiment, in which the atmosphere is coupled to an ocean mixed layer heat equation allowing limited air\u2013sea interactions; and 3) a climatology experiment, in which the atmosphere is forced by an observed SST climatology with a fixed annual cycle, allowing no air\u2013sea interactions. It is found that the observed modes are reasonably simulated in all three experiments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6487337717255682976", "cites_id": ["6487337717255682976"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/15/10/1520-0442_2002_015_1159_moivot_2.0.co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oLsET0inB1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 7, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 10, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
