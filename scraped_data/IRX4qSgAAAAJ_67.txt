In spite of various modelling efforts, it remains uncertain how the SPCZ will respond to greenhouse warming. Using a hierarchy of climate models we show that the uncertainty of SPCZ rainfall projections in present-generation climate models can be explained as a result of two competing mechanisms. Higher tropical sea surface temperatures lead to an overall increase of atmospheric moisture and rainfall whereas weaker sea surface temperature gradients dynamically shift the SPCZ northeastward and promote summer drying in areas of the southwest Pacific. On the basis of a multi-model ensemble of 76 greenhouse warming experiments and for moderate tropical warming of 1\u20132\u2009\u00b0C we estimate a 6% decrease of SPCZ rainfall with a multi-model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4386756255648849582", "cites_id": ["4386756255648849582"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1726", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rh4sjpLj4DwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
