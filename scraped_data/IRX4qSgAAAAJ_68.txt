These include the extent to which the ACW is related to El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles and the need to reconcile differences between the observed zonal wavenumber 2 pattern and the wavenumber 3 pattern found in coupled ocean\u2010atmosphere models. In the present study we revisit the sea surface temperature (SST) signal of the observed ACW. We find that the associated SST variations may be decomposed into several empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) that are linearly independent. The first four EOFs describe 84% of the total variance on timescales of 3\u20137 years, and superposition of SST signals of the four EOFs reproduces SST signals of the observed ACW. Given that EOF analysis can only describe standing oscillations, we then employ complex EOF (CEOF) analysis suitable for studying propagating waves.
