They carry warm tropical water to the mid-latitudes and vent large amounts of heat and moisture to the atmosphere along their paths, affecting atmospheric jet streams and mid-latitude storms, as well as ocean carbon uptake,,,. The possibility that these highly energetic currents might change under greenhouse-gas forcing has raised significant concerns,,, but detecting such changes is challenging owing to limited observations. Here, using reconstructed sea surface temperature datasets and century-long ocean and atmosphere reanalysis products, we find that the post-1900 surface ocean warming rate over the path of these currents is two to three times faster than the global mean surface ocean warming rate. The accelerated warming is associated with a synchronous poleward shift and/or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 668, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7195586381305064537", "cites_id": ["7195586381305064537"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1353", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WaxToLDb22MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 14, "2013": 24, "2014": 50, "2015": 52, "2016": 53, "2017": 79, "2018": 56, "2019": 80, "2020": 64, "2021": 81, "2022": 83, "2023": 27}}
