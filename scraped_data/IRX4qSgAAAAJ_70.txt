The present study explores fluctuations of this ENSO-rainfall relationship. It is found that the relationship tends to weaken when the linearly detrended global mean temperature is rising or particularly high, as in the period of 1931-45 period and since the late 1970s. Prior to a weakening, a correlation pattern of increased rainfall during El Ni\u00f1o events is seen first in northwestern Australia, then in eastern and southeastern Australia, and eventually in NE Australia. The 1931-45 period was particularly intriguing, when in terms of rainfall variability over NE Australia, the interannual ENSO-rainfall relationship went through a process of weakening, reversal, and rapid recovery. Features associated with the reversal are therefore examined and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14893456246825051834", "cites_id": ["14893456246825051834"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/d2b011492718424855e1fd579ffbc465/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=54165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:umbULYwvsM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 8, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 6}}
