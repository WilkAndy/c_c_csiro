A greater convection anomaly and an equivalent-barotropic Rossby wave train response occurs during pIOD events than during negative IOD (nIOD) events. Over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and South China Sea (SCS), an associated low-level anomalous anticyclone strengthens the southwesterlies during boreal fall (September, October and November, SON), when a pIOD matures. The increased moisture flux gives rise to the anomalously high rainfall over southern China. During its developing phase (boreal summer, June, July and August, JJA), the influence of a pIOD event on the contemporaneous rainfall over southern China is weak, but a JJA pIOD index is highly correlated with fall rainfall. Therefore, this index can serve as a potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10742902910300673478", "cites_id": ["10742902910300673478"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04943", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xlX7UEd1FpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 25, "2023": 7}}
