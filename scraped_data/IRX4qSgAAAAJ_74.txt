Some of the ENSO discharge/recharge signals transmit into the Indian Ocean, but the pathway is yet to be fully established. This study reveals a previously un\u2010noticed subtropical North Pacific (NP) pathway. NP Rossby waves associated with ENSO impinge on the western boundary and move equatorward along the \u201cray\u2010path\u201d of Kelvin\u2010Munk waves, and reflect as equatorial Kelvin waves. En\u2010route to the equator, the waves are reinforced by wind stress anomalies associated with ENSO. The reflected equatorial Kelvin waves impinge on the Australasian continent and move poleward along the northern western Australia (WA) coast as coastally\u2010trapped waves, radiating Rossby waves into the south Indian Ocean. In this way, some 55% of the total \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14119669350088219052", "cites_id": ["14119669350088219052"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004GL021736", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rJn69XYk88MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 12, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
