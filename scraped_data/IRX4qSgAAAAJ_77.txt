The characteristics and mechanisms of tropical rainfall variations on centennial to decadal scales are, however, still unclear. Here, we reconstruct a replicated stalagmite-based 2,700-y-long, continuous record of rainfall for the deeply convective northern central Indo-Pacific (NCIP) region. Our record reveals decreasing rainfall in the NCIP over the past 2,700 y, similar to other records from the northern tropics. Notable centennial- to decadal-scale dry climate episodes occurred in both the NCIP and the southern central Indo-Pacific (SCIP) during the 20th century [Current Warm Period (CWP)] and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), resembling enhanced El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions. Further, we developed a 2,000-y-long ITCZ shift index record that supports an overall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15266236550787597519", "cites_id": ["15266236550787597519"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1903167116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:z4THSkKR3NMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 21, "2021": 21, "2022": 20, "2023": 9}}
