Using 20th century experiments submitted for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), we show that a 19\u2010model average IOD index over the 1950\u20131999 period yields an upward trend. The associated circulation trends provide a favourable environment for pIOD development, leading to a 17% increase in pIOD frequency compared with the case in which trends are removed. The majority of the increase manifests as a frequency increase in the two\u2010 and three\u2010consecutive events. The circulation trends are in turn consistent with wind changes associated with a weaker Walker circulation in the Pacific and an enhanced land\u2010sea temperature contrast in the Indian Ocean (IO) sector. Our results suggest that although it is difficult to attribute the trigger of the recent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3352449140788130074", "cites_id": ["3352449140788130074"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009GL040163", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GnE9RLtKhi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
