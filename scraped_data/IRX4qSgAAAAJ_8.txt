The 1998\u20131999 extreme La Ni\u00f1a event that followed the 1997\u20131998 extreme El Ni\u00f1o event switched extreme El Ni\u00f1o-induced severe droughts to devastating floods in western Pacific countries, and vice versa in the southwestern United States,. During extreme La Ni\u00f1a events, cold sea surface conditions develop in the central Pacific,, creating an enhanced temperature gradient from the Maritime continent to the central Pacific. Recent studies have revealed robust changes in El Ni\u00f1o characteristics in response to simulated future greenhouse warming,,, but how La Ni\u00f1a will change remains unclear.
