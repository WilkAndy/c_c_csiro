An assessment is provided on 24 climate models that constitute phase 3 of the World Climate Research Programme\u2019s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (WCRP CMIP3), used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).The strength of the ENSO\u2013rainfall teleconnection, defined as the correlation between rainfall and Ni\u00f1o-3.4, is overwhelmingly controlled by the amplitude of ENSO signals relative to stochastic noise, highlighting the importance of realistically simulating this parameter. Because ENSO influences arise from the movement of convergence zones from their mean positions, the well-known equatorial Pacific climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17663400134450961892", "cites_id": ["17663400134450961892"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/22/19/2009jcli2694.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5F2Ja9YAIfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 15, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
