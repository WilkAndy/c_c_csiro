The variability is barotropic in nature with signals in the middle troposphere as well as at the atmosphere\u2013ocean interface. Moreover, there are preferred fixed centers for the strongest anomalies. These features are well reproduced by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation coupled model on various timescales. On the interannual timescale, an index of the modeled wavenumber-3 pattern shows little correlation with the modeled Southern Oscillation index, suggesting that the variability associated with wavenumber-3 anomalies is separate to modeled ENSO-like events. However, the variation of the pattern index is strikingly similar to, and highly correlated with, the modeled oceanic variability.
