The impact is influenced by sea surface temperature (SST), yet models disagree on how pIOD SST may respond to greenhouse warming. Here we find increased SST variability of strong pIOD events, with strong equatorial eastern Indian Ocean cool anomalies, but decreased variability of moderate pIOD events, dominated by western warm anomalies. This opposite response is detected in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) climate models that simulate the two pIOD regimes. Under greenhouse warming, the lower troposphere warms faster than the surface, limiting Ekman pumping that drives the moderate pIOD warm anomalies; however, faster surface warming in the equatorial western region favours atmospheric convection in the west, strengthening \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11757117523963847225", "cites_id": ["11757117523963847225"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00943-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OaJinhisKaMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 19, "2022": 36, "2023": 14}}
