The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming below 2\u2009\u00b0C and ideally below 1.5\u2009\u00b0C in global mean temperature (GMT), but how extreme pIOD will respond to this target is unclear. Here we show that the frequency increases linearly as the warming proceeds, and doubles at 1.5\u2009\u00b0C warming from the pre-industrial level (statistically significant above the 90% confidence level), underscored by a strong intermodel agreement with 11 out of 13 models producing an increase. However, in sharp contrast to a continuous increase in extreme El Ni\u00f1o frequency long after GMT stabilisation, the extreme pIOD frequency peaks as the GMT stabilises. The contrasting response corresponds to a 50% reduction in frequency of an extreme El Ni\u00f1o preceded by an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5696351356097311415", "cites_id": ["5696351356097311415"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03789-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t7L-t2CBDU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 25, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
