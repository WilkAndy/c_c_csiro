Conducive atmospheric conditions are important to affect occurrence of severe haze events, and circulation changes induced by future global climate warming are projected to increase the frequency of such events. However, a potential contribution of an anthropogenic influence to recent most severe haze (December 2015 and January 2013) over eastern China remains unclear. Here we show that the anthropogenic influence, which is estimated by using large ensemble runs with a climate model forced with and without anthropogenic forcings, has already increased the probability of the atmospheric patterns conducive to severe haze by at least 45% in January 2013 and 27% in December 2015, respectively. We further confirm that simulated atmospheric circulation pattern changes induced by anthropogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=275824243629788823", "cites_id": ["275824243629788823"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL076570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l47-LbDs0wMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 18, "2020": 15, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
