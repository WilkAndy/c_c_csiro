During such episodes, levels of fine particulate matter are harmful to human health and the environment, and cause massive disruption to economic activities,,,,,,,,,,,, as occurred in January 2013,,,,. Conducive weather conditions are an important ingredient of severe haze episodes,, and include reduced surface winter northerlies,, weakened northwesterlies in the midtroposphere, and enhanced thermal stability of the lower atmosphere,,,. How such weather conditions may respond to climate change is not clear. Here we project a 50% increase in the frequency and an 80% increase in the persistence of conducive weather conditions similar to those in January 2013, in response to climate change.
