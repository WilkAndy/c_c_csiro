A series of experiments is described in which the flow is driven by wind forcing only, thermohaline forcing only, or both. In a global ocean with topography, the circulation driven by wind alone is strongly influenced by contours of constant potential vorticity, which limit the barotropic transport to relatively small values. With the same geometry, the flow driven by relaxing to observed surface temperature and salinity fields alone contains deep overturning circulation (producing North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW)) and a large barotropic Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) generated by bottom form stress. The ACC is dependent on the overturning circulation, the deep density field and the bottom form stress \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2562537526568101803,2505132415320079390", "cites_id": ["2562537526568101803", "2505132415320079390"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/96JC00669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qyezsk32jyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 9, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 8, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 1}}
