Although major international efforts are underway to provide decadal climate predictions, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the characteristics and causes of TPDV and the accuracy to which it can be simulated and predicted. Here, we critically synthesize what, as of now, is known and not known and provide recommendations to improve our understanding of TPDV and our ability to predict it.TPDV is evident in instrumental records, paleoclimate records over past millennia, and climate models. TPDV can occur spontaneously as \u201cinternal\u201d variability, as is largely the case in the central equatorial Pacific, or in response to \u201cexternal\u201d forcing. Although internal TPDV arises \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7867722728458118271", "cites_id": ["7867722728458118271"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aay9165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f2QD9SLEL20J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 33, "2023": 28}}
