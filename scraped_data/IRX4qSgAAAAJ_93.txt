The dynamics is not fully understood. Here we show that in March\u2013May, westward propagating oceanic Rossby waves, a remnant consequence of the weak 2018 Pacific warm condition, led to anomalous sea surface temperature warming in the southwest tropical Indian Ocean (TIO), inducing deep convection and anomalous easterly winds along the equator, which triggered the initial cooling in the east. In June\u2013August, the easterly wind anomalies continued to evolve through ocean\u2010atmosphere coupling involving Bjerknes feedback and equatorial nonlinear ocean advection, until its maturity in September\u2013November. This study clarifies the contribution of oceanic Rossby waves in the south TIO in different dynamic settings and reveals a new triggering mechanism for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8518594199622620271", "cites_id": ["8518594199622620271"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020gl090079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:b5Q1hkogOHYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 23, "2022": 27, "2023": 12}}
