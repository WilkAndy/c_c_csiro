In recent decades, ASM strength (as represented by precipitation) has been decreasing, but instrumental measurements span only a short period of time. The initiation and the dynamics of the recent trend are unclear. Here for the first time, we use an ensemble of 10 tree ring\u2010width chronologies from the west\u2010central margin of ASM to reconstruct detail of ASM variability back to 1566 CE. The reconstruction captures weak/strong ASM events and also reflects major locust plagues. Notably, we found an unprecedented 80\u2010year trend of decreasing ASM strength within the context of the 448\u2010year reconstruction, which is contrary to what is expected from greenhouse warming. Our coupled climate model shows that increasing anthropogenic sulfate aerosol emissions over the Northern Hemisphere could be the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16982089234423408819", "cites_id": ["16982089234423408819"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019gl082497", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s-jKCS-ArOsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 4, "2020": 17, "2021": 15, "2022": 18, "2023": 9}}
