Although these changes, featuring strong zonal asymmetry, are partially influenced by increasing greenhouse gas emissions and stratospheric ozone depletion, tropical\u2013polar teleconnections are believed to have a role through Rossby wave dynamics. In this Review, we synthesize understanding of tropical teleconnections to the Southern Hemisphere extratropics arising from the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, focusing on the mechanisms and long-term climatic impacts. These teleconnections have contributed to observed Antarctic and Southern Ocean changes, including regional rapid surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17732089373240052052", "cites_id": ["17732089373240052052"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00204-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VMlzGVYJFfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 30, "2023": 31}}
