This is distinct from the eastern Pacific warming pattern during canonical El Ni\u00f1o events. Accordingly, the central-Pacific El Ni\u00f1o exerts distinct impacts on ecosystems, climate and hurricanes worldwide. The increased frequency of the new type of El Ni\u00f1o presents a challenge not only for the understanding of El Ni\u00f1o dynamics and its change but also for the prediction of El Ni\u00f1o and its global impacts at present and future climate. Previous studies have proposed different indices to represent the two types of El Ni\u00f1o for better understanding, prediction and impact assessment. Here, we find that all popularly used indices for the central-Pacific El Ni\u00f1o show a dominant spectral peak at a decadal period with comparatively weak variance at interannual timescales.
