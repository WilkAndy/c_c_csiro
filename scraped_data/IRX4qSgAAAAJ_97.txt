For example, the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) extends its influence on modes of variability in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans, which in turn feed back onto ENSO. Interactions between pairs of modes can alter their strength, periodicity, seasonality, and ultimately their predictability, yet little is known about the role that a third mode plays. Here we examine the interactions and relative influences between pairs of climate modes using ensembles of 100-year partially coupled experiments in an otherwise fully coupled general circulation model. In these experiments, the air\u2013sea interaction over each tropical ocean basin, as well as pairs of ocean basins, is suppressed in turn. We find that Indian Ocean variability has a net damping effect on ENSO and Atlantic Ocean variability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16429614449576665178", "cites_id": ["16429614449576665178"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-016-3199-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WmCkR0u3AeQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 9, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
