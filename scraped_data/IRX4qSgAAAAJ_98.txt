The dynamics for these rainfall changes are not clear. Using outputs from a climate model, we show that a summer rainfall increase is consistent with a large Tasman Sea warming promoting convection, and an upward trend of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) promoting onshore flows; these processes dominate over a rainfall decrease from an El Ni\u00f1o\u2010like warming pattern. In winter, similar effects from a Tasman Sea warming and an upward SAM trend operate along Australia's east coast, however, the rain\u2010reducing impact of an Indian Ocean Dipole\u2010like warming pattern dominates. In both seasons, the upward SAM trend causes a rainfall reduction over southern Australia. Summer rainfall over north\u2010western Australia is projected to decrease, due to an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8726452382075745215", "cites_id": ["8726452382075745215"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007gl032436", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v3P87jSWGnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 13, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
