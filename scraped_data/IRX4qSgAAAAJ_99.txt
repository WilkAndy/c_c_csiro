Here, we investigate the possibility of the rainfall reduction being a part of multidecadal variability using outputs of the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model. We find that multidecadal\u2010long drying trends comparable to the observed exist in an experiment without climate change forcing. The model multidecadal\u2010long rainfall decline manifests as a reduction in high\u2010intensity rainfall events and is accompanied by an upward trend of the southern annular mode (SAM) with an increasing midlatitude mean sea level pressure (MSLP). Thus, multidecadal variability could primarily be responsible for the observed winter rainfall reduction, and could potentially superimpose \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IRX4qSgAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11936637323160667924", "cites_id": ["11936637323160667924"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005GL022712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FEepA2d0p6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 14, "2010": 11, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
