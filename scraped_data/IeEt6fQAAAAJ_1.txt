The objectives of this review are to introduce the key aspects pertaining to nanomaterials in the environment and to discuss what is known concerning their fate, behavior, disposition, and toxicity, with a particular focus on those that make up manufactured nanomaterials. This review critiques existing nanomaterial research in freshwater, marine, and soil environments. It illustrates the paucity of existing research and demonstrates the need for additional research. Environmental scientists are encouraged to base this research on existing studies on colloidal behavior and toxicology. The need for standard reference and testing materials as well as methodology for suspension preparation and testing is also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 3239, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4545894645881375323", "cites_id": ["4545894645881375323"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1897/08-090.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WwocYhhDFj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 65, "2010": 127, "2011": 175, "2012": 224, "2013": 309, "2014": 303, "2015": 281, "2016": 310, "2017": 276, "2018": 260, "2019": 235, "2020": 190, "2021": 201, "2022": 164, "2023": 88}}
