The coating procedure, performed by applying a solution of the polymer to the electrode surface, Is con-venient and fast. Subsequently, mercury Is plated onto the electrode. The thickness of the polymer film Is so low that It does not Impede mass transport of the analytes. In com-parison with the conventional mercury film electrode, the main advantages of the modified electrode are Improved resistance to Interference from surface-active compounds, Increased sensitivity when used In conjunction with differential voltammetric methods, and better mechanical stability of the mer-cury film. The analytical utility of the polymer-coated electrode Is demonstrated by application to untreated urine sam-ples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 348, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14301084578493972946", "cites_id": ["14301084578493972946"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac00140a007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0kHzW6eod8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 5, "1989": 7, "1990": 19, "1991": 8, "1992": 12, "1993": 14, "1994": 24, "1995": 17, "1996": 14, "1997": 16, "1998": 9, "1999": 18, "2000": 14, "2001": 13, "2002": 9, "2003": 11, "2004": 14, "2005": 15, "2006": 12, "2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
