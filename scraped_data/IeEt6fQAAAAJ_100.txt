The kinetics of the H+/UO22+ ion exchange reaction, and the UO22+ and U(IV)/UO22+ chemical reactions on Dowex AG 50W action exchange resin were studied in H2SO4 media. The possibility of developing a large scale process for uranium enrichment based on a U(IV)/U(VI) chemical exchange reaction was considered, and it was concluded that such a process would be uneconomic compared with established methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=72220365785858567", "cites_id": ["72220365785858567"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022190275809250", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BwI3QAqUAAEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
