Indium(III) was studied in a variety of supporting electrolytes, and showed completely different behaviour at hanging drop and thin film electrodes. The thin film electrode was far more sensitive to the chemical form of indium in solution, and for maximum sensitivity, bromide or iodide had to be present in the supporting electrolyte.For the concentration of indium from seawater or river waters, and its separation from lead and cadmium, indium was coprecipitated on ferric hydroxide, then separated by ion exchange chromatography from HCl media. Surface Pacific seawater was found to contain less than 5\u00d710\u22124 \u03bcg In l\u22121, but indium was detected in two samples of polluted river water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14190904383825869355", "cites_id": ["14190904383825869355"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072874803359", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K3p5t1k48MQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 3, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
