Aquatic organisms may experience toxic effects from exposure to dissolved and particulate aluminium. Therefore, the current study reports the geochemical controls such as speciation, precipitation and adsorption that influence the exposure to these aluminium forms in the field and the laboratory. Abstract A combination of field and laboratory investigations was conducted in order to gain an understanding of aluminium dynamics in coastal seawater environments. Filterable (<0.025 and <0.45\u00b5m) aluminium concentrations in waters collected from an industrialised coastal location at Gladstone, Central Queensland, Australia ranged from 0.8 to 39.4\u00b5gL\u20131. Size-based separation measurements made on field and laboratory-spiked coastal waters \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9877681966686546373", "cites_id": ["9877681966686546373"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/EN/EN15029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xSmiHGqTFIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
