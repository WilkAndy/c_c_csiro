The selenium content of marine organisms is well documented but little information is available on the selenium content of waters and sediments. The speciation of selenium in organisms, water and sediments is unknown although it appears that selenium is associated with proteins. The occurrence and speciation of arsenic in marine organisms has been extensively studied, with arsonobetaine being isolated as the probable end\u2010product of arsenic metabolism in marine food chains. However, organisms can produce other organoarsenic compounds, e.g. trimethylarsine oxide, which may be metabolized to toxic end\u2010products. Little is known about the occurrence and speciation of arsenic in waters and sediments.
