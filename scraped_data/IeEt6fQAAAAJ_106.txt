Reactions followed a first order equation with benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[a]anthracene being the most rapidly photodegraded. Generally, the more polar the solvent the faster is the degradation process.A number of photodegradation products were identified by gas chromatography\u2014mass spectrometry. The identification of compounds such as 4-amino-1-naphthalenecarbonitrile and 1H,3H-naphthol[1,8-cd]pyran-1-one clearly indicated that the solvent molecules have taken part in the formation of these compounds. Solvent-induced photodegradation is shown to be an important consideration in choosing the optimum solvent for the best analytical recoveries of PAHs from various matrices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11623433929780347015", "cites_id": ["11623433929780347015"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967301942669", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h8DHVpO7TqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
