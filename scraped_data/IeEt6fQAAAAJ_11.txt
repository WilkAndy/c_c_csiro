Anodic stripping voltammetric results suggest that the major part of the unavailable trace metal is adsorbed on, or occluded in, organic or inorganic colloidal particles. An ionic equilibria computer program was used to predict the effect of various complexing agents on trace metal species in sea-water. Citric acid and amino-acids, with the exception of l-cysteine, were shown to be unimportant as complexing agents, and the ability of an EDTA-like ligand to complex Cu, Pb, Cd and Zn is controlled entirely by the concentrations of the ligand and of \u201clabile\u201d Fe(III) and Cr(III) in sea-water, since these two ions together will react quantitatively with EDTA. l-Cysteine, if present in sea-water, would also complex the trace metals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 314, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3814369891177291251", "cites_id": ["3814369891177291251"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003991407680166X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:812R5TRd7zQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 11, "1984": 15, "1985": 12, "1986": 7, "1987": 8, "1988": 8, "1989": 11, "1990": 11, "1991": 9, "1992": 14, "1993": 8, "1994": 4, "1995": 8, "1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 9, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
