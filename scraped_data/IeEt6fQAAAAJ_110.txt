The major advantages of Teflon over quartz are that it is less fragile and more readily manipulated. Teflon FEP transmits UV light at wavelengths above 240 nm al-though the transmittance falls below 280 nm(at 260 nm, it is one-tenth ofthat of quartz). Its efficiency at low wave-lengths is believed to be enhanced by diffuse radiation transfer and internal reflectance (I).Teflon is also a recommended material for use in trace metal studies where the hydrophobic surface is less likely to result in adsorptive losses and is readily purified of trace metal contaminants by acid washing. The latter feature makes Teflon bottles an attractive alternative to quartz tubes for the UV irradiation of natural water samples. This treatment is of value in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1827501260608123890", "cites_id": ["1827501260608123890"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac00276a066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8jMgybaWXBkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 2, "1989": 4, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
