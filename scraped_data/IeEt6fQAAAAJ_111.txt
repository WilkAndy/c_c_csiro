Anodic stripping voltammetry, at either the hanging mercury drop electrode or glassy carbon thin film electrode, is suitable for the determination of labile lead and cadmium. The presence of dissolved oxygen increases the height of the lead wave with a shift to more negative potentials. A more versatile technique is in situ deposition of labile metals on a mercury-coated graphite tube electrode. The mercury film, deposited in the laboratory, is stable on the dried tubes which are used later for field electrodeposition. The deposited metals are determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7688462220148018893", "cites_id": ["7688462220148018893"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267001839052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zQ7vbKfnsmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 3, "1983": 6, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 3, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
