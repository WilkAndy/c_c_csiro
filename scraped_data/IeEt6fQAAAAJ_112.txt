Analytical data for TBT in Sydney waters are consistent with other data reported for overseas estuaries, with the majority of samples containing less than 45 ng Sn L-1 as TBT. Samples from areas of high boating activity such as Rushcutters Bay and Garden Island gave the highest TBT concentrations at 90-190 ng Sn L-1. The mean ambient TBT concentration in each estuary was computed using a tidal prism model. Despite the broad assumptions made, calculated results agreed well with those measured at sites with no obvious local point source of TBT."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2542323783715579197", "cites_id": ["2542323783715579197"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF9890039", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PeVk8AImSCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
