Despite the recognition of this occurring, nominal, measured initial or time\u2010averaged concentrations are commonly used for the calculation of inhibitory or effect concentrations from toxicity test data. Because a premise of constant exposure is assumed but not met in these calculations, the toxicity of the test water may be significantly underestimated. Laboratory experiments using a 72\u2010h algal growth inhibition bioassay and copper as a toxicant are used to demonstrate that calculated inhibitory concentrations will often be underestimated twofold if losses of copper occurring over the 72\u2010h test duration are not considered. A simple model is presented for toxicant concentration decline and for the relationship between algal growth rate and toxicant concentration. This model is used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6124151374669948312", "cites_id": ["6124151374669948312"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1897/02-418", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mCXsZTpb_VQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
