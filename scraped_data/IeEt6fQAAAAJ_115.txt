At peak production these discharges will result in an increase in the suspended solids levels in the Fly River from a background of 76 mg L-1 to approximately 800 mg L-1, and an increase in median particulate copper levels from 90 \u03bcg g-1 to 1220 \u03bcg g-1. The dissolved copper levels are not expected to exceed 10 \u03bcg L-1. The Strickland River, a tributary of the Fly River, has natural suspended solids levels in excess of 500 mg L-1 and provided a natural bioassay for the impacts of elevated suspended solids levels. The fish communities of the Strickland River were dominated by the sediment-tolerant Ariidae catfish, but the levels of biomass caught per standard sampling effort were comparable to those in the Fly River. Laboratory bioassays were performed to assess \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18339026999467710995", "cites_id": ["18339026999467710995"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00677924", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ExqSReRPgf4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
