The phenomenon was studied in detail and it was observed that the apparent activation energies of the catalyzed and uncatalyzed rates were the same, the effect of the catalyst being to increase the preexponential factor of the Arrhenius equation. The results suggest that the gaseous reactant, either O2 or H2, is adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and dissociated into atoms or some other activated species which subsequently desorb, migrate away from the catalyst surface and react with the substrate. Results are presented which suggest that in the case of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13818566600107102498", "cites_id": ["13818566600107102498"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951774900165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IhF24Btpxb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
