The methods range from simple procedures which discriminate between weakly and strongly complexed forms of the metal, to comprehensive analytical schemes which can determine as many as seven species of each metal. The many problems involved in this exacting area of trace analysis are discussed in detail."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:U_HPUtbDl20C", "num_citations": 313, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16122047292579425449", "cites_id": ["16122047292579425449"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039914077800805", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qaw-JpgEvd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 24, "1984": 14, "1985": 11, "1986": 12, "1987": 15, "1988": 11, "1989": 8, "1990": 13, "1991": 5, "1992": 4, "1993": 3, "1994": 7, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
