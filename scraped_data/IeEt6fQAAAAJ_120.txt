Aquatic organisms may experience different toxic effects from exposure to dissolved and particulate trace metals. This study reports the limits to lead solubility in seawater that influence the exposure to these forms of lead in the field and the laboratory. Abstract A combination of laboratory investigations and thermodynamic modelling were conducted in order to gain an understanding of the factors controlling lead solubility in seawater. In experiments where increasing amounts of lead were added to seawater (in order to avoid supersaturation) and equilibrated for up to 28 days, the maximum solubility was ~2mgL\u20131 (pH 8.15, 22\u00b0C). However, at higher added lead concentrations, which caused the rapid formation of lead precipitates, the solution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2977280585359508939", "cites_id": ["2977280585359508939"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/EN/EN15150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y0UFB-tsUSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
