The hardness values of a substantial proportion of Australian freshwaters fall below the application boundary of the existing European nickel biotic ligand models (Ni BLMs) of 2\u2009mg Ca/L. Toxicity testing was undertaken using Hydra viridissima to assess the predictive ability of the existing Ni BLM for this species in extremely soft waters. This testing revealed an increased competitive effect of Ca and Mg with Ni for binding to the biotic ligand in soft water (<10\u2009mg CaCO3/L) than at higher water hardness. Modifications were made to the Ni BLM by increasing the binding constants for Ca and Mg at the biotic ligand to account for softer waters encountered in Australia and the more important competitive effect of Ca and Mg on Ni toxicity. To validate the modified Ni BLM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10171942304708225470", "cites_id": ["10171942304708225470"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4213", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vunmA6L_KY0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
