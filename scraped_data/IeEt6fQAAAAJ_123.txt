Too often, by the time responders arrive at the scene, the slick has moved, dissolved, dispersed or sunk. This Oil Spill Monitoring Handbook provides practical advice on what information is likely required following the accidental release of oil or other petroleum-based products into the marine environment. The book focuses on response phase monitoring for maritime spills, otherwise known as Type I or operational monitoring. Response phase monitoring tries to address the questions\u2013what? where? when? how? how much?\u2013that assist responders to find, track, predict and clean up spills, and to assess their efforts. Oil spills often occur in remote, sensitive and logistically difficult locations, often in adverse weather, and the oil can change character and location over time. An effective response requires robust information provided by monitoring, observation, sampling and science. The Oil Spill Monitoring Handbook completely updates the Australian Maritime Safety Authority\u2019s 2003 edition of the same name, taking into account the latest scientific advances in physical, chemical and biological monitoring, many of which have evolved as a consequence of major oil spill disasters in the last decade. It includes sections on the chemical properties of oil, the toxicological impacts of oil exposure, and the impacts of oil exposure on different marine habitats with relevance to Australia and elsewhere. An overview is provided on how monitoring integrates with the oil spill response process, the response organisation, the use of decision-support tools such as net environmental benefit \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13064740394038439132", "cites_id": ["13064740394038439132"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=sZpPDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:3KxbHStIT7UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=JAhGQrhl0W&sig=zC78i-C3D8mwRJItCqR0MbK6Ce8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3KxbHStIT7UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
