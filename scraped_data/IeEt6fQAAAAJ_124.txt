Nanotechnologies and engineered nanoparticles are finding applications in a diverse range of products and markets including the automotive industry, medical technology, cosmetics and environmental remediation. The global market for nanotechnologies is estimated to be in excess of US $1 trillion by 2015. Concerns are now being raised that the growing production, use, and subsequent disposal of engineered nanoparticles will inevitably lead to their appearance in ground and surface waters and soils. In water, nanoparticles may present a significant environmental risk as they become degraded, transformed, and accumulated in a variety of ways (Colvin 2003)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1763154067719638607", "cites_id": ["1763154067719638607"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/6353520_The_importance_of_physical_and_chemical_characterization_in_nanoparticle_toxicity_studies/links/5aa5fd2ea6fdccd544bc53b1/The-importance-of-physical-and-chemical-characterization-in-nanoparticle-toxicity-studies.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T862ckj7dxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
