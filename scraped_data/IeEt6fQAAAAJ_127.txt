Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry was used as the detection system. When an anion exchange HPLC column with a range of solvents was used for the separation of the five arsenic compounds, all species were not resolved successfully; arsenobetaine typically coeluted with arsenic (III). A reversed phase C18 column was able to separate arsenobetaine under certain conditions but resolved the remaining four species into only two peaks.
