The stereochemistry of the copper atoms in the binuclear complexes is inferred from comparisons of their reflectance spectra with the spectra of the simple copper complexes CuB and CuL2. The structures of the zinc complexes are discussed by reference to near ultraviolet spectra of the ligands and infrared spectra in the 1500-1560 cm-1 region. The evidence suggests that in the complexes of the type MB,M'Cl2 either but not both metal atoms may approach a tetrahedral environment. The chemistry of the complexes ZnB,ZnCl2 is complicated by the possibility of either or both zinc atoms becoming 5 coordinate by addition of solvent molecules; in some of these complexes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11764458861598585477", "cites_id": ["11764458861598585477"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH9681473", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hbJH_ADBQ6MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 4, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
