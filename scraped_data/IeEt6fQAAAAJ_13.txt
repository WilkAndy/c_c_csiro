Recommended prodecures are given which minimise the problems of sample contamination and adsorption losses. Carefully cleaned high-density polythene or Teflon containers are recommended for both sampling and storage, with a storage temperature of 4\u00b0C. Acidification to 0.05 M H+ with nitric acid is desirable, except in speciation studies. For mercury analysis the addition of an oxidant or complexing agent is also necessary."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 312, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7577345387302026097", "cites_id": ["7577345387302026097"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0043135477900422", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cfuUtnsjKGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 10, "1985": 13, "1986": 11, "1987": 12, "1988": 7, "1989": 10, "1990": 6, "1991": 7, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 14, "1995": 7, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 6, "1999": 6, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 1, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
