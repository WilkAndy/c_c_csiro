Acidification alone was demonstrated to be inadequate and resulted in a significant underestimation of dissolved Cu (losses ranging from 50% to >90%). Similar losses were observed in both polyethylene and Teflon storage bottles. Experiments suggest that losses of copper occur following sample acidification owing to the formation of stable copper sulfide phases which adsorb onto container surfaces. It is therefore recommended that an oxidative pretreatment step is carried out prior to the acidification of porewaters collected for metal analysis. The results of this study suggest that much of the previous data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8374473345619827925", "cites_id": ["8374473345619827925"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac980006v", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1ZylUiMbOHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 8, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
