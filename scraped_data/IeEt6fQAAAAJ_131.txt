The snails were exposed for 2 wk to polluted sediments collected from Port Kembla Harbour, Blackwattle Bay, Lake Illawarra, Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, Australia, and the Derwent River in Tasmania, Australia. Metal accumulation and regulation by this species were evaluated. Metal concentrations in snail tissues and total, EDTA and HCl-extractable metals in the sediments were compared. Copper concentrations were extremely varied in snails exposed to the same sediment. This was not the case for other matals tested. No accumulation of copper was found in snails exposed to different sediments. There was no zinc accumulation from sediments containing less then 10 mg Zn/g. P. sordidus could accumulate lead, manganese and iron from some of the sediments \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13115577776075580955", "cites_id": ["13115577776075580955"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00350058", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gyb-fn_kA7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
