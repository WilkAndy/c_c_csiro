A three-factor analysis of variance showed that the presence of shell curls in oysters was significant in the area closest to the boats and the contaminant source was restricted from migration to leases on the other side of a channel. A good correlation between shell deformities and TBT accumulation was obtained. Significant TBT accumulation occurred within the brief exposure of young oysters; however, an analysis of the distribution of butyltins before and after removal of the boats suggested that the oysters were responding to degradation products in the water rather than promotingin vivo degradation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6394050771645631045", "cites_id": ["6394050771645631045"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01055916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RQrAt0w7vFgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
