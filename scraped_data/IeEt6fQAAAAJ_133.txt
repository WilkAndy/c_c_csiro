The market value of GNMs is predicted to reach $US 1.3 billion by 2023. Common to many nanomaterials, an important and unresolved question is the environmental consequences of the increases in GNMs use. The current deficiencies in studies reporting ecotoxicology data for GNMs include differences in analytical methodologies for quantification, no standardized test guidelines, differences in morphology of GNMs, the lack of Chemical Abstract Service numbers, and the quality of the reported data. The assessment of potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms typically relies on guideline values based on species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) of toxicity data. We present preliminary water quality guideline values for graphene oxide NMs in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14828318763488750281", "cites_id": ["14828318763488750281"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yaoBAlrFyM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
