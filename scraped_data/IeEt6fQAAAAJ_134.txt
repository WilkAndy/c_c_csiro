Background concentrations of copper, zinc, lead, cadmium and manganese in field crabs did not vary greatly in a range of different body sizes and all accumulated zinc, lead, cadmium, manganese and iron. Copper was only accumulated from sediment spiked with a high concentration of copper, which also had toxic effects. Accumulated metals were mostly derived from sediment rather than the water column. The sediment particles ingested by the crabs were also analysed. Correlations between lead and cadmium in these particles in the crabs were significant. Metals accumulated in the crabs and two chemical extractions of sediment were also compared.
