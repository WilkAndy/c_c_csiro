High concentrations in sewage sludge (>100\u00b5g Si g-1) are not reflected in waters receiving a sewage discharge. However, the high affinity of hydrophobic silicones for large-surface-area clayey sediments leads to wide variability within a single waterbody, indicative of localized inputs. Furthermore, the fine structure of organosilicon sediment-depth profiles affords an excellent chemical indicator of a 1950 horizon, the approximate date of introduction of these compounds to Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16003727072393217533", "cites_id": ["16003727072393217533"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf9910287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_cVMIPuoGN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
