Both the principles and applications of the technique are dealt with in some detail. Electrolytic preconcentration can be combined with a variety of instrumental techniques. Special attention is given to stripping voltammetry, potentiometric stripping analysis, different combinations with atomic-absorption spectrometry, and the use of flow-through porous electrodes. It is pointed out that the electrolytic preconcentration technique deserves more extensive use as well as fundamental investigation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10271811892940218851", "cites_id": ["10271811892940218851"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039914086801096", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:46FVhn7OjI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
