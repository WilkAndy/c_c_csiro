The method utilises 3 M HCl as supporting electrolyte and a combined glassy carbon mercury film electrode at an electrolysis potential of \u2013400 mV versus Ag\u2013AgCl (1 M HCl) for the reliable determination of ultratrace concentrations of antimony. A detection limit of 0.3 \u00b5g l\u20131 and a linear concentration range of 0.3\u2013150 \u00b5g/l\u20131 antimony were accomplished under these conditions with an electrolysis time of 10 min. The use of L-cysteine was effective for the reduction of SbV to SbIII and its subsequent use for the ASP determination of the metalloid. The method was successfully applied to the determination of trace and ultratrace concentrations of antimony in water and orchard leaves samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1793772029036052131", "cites_id": ["1793772029036052131"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1998/an/a803408g", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o765FijC5BgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
