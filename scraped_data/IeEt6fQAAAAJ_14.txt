These biological endpoints include molecular, biochemical, and physiological markers (i.e., biomarkers) that when integrated, can clarify issues of contaminant bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and ecological effects while enabling a better understanding of the effects of nonchemical stressors. In the case of contaminant stressors, an understanding of chemical modes of toxicity can be incorporated with diagnostic markers of aquatic animal physiology to help understand the health status of aquatic organisms in the field. Furthermore, new approaches in functional genomics and bioinformatics can help discriminate individual chemicals, or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 291, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15488093754324058046", "cites_id": ["15488093754324058046"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ieam.1530", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vn9uyjXD8NYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 11, "2017": 29, "2018": 29, "2019": 36, "2020": 46, "2021": 64, "2022": 43, "2023": 27}}
