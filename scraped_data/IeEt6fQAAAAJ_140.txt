Four compounds, pirimicarb, methiocarb, aminocarb and zectran, give oxidation waves; however, only those for aminocarb and zectran are suitable for analytical electrochemical detection in association with high-pressure liquid chromatography. The oxidation reaction has an ECE mechanism, proposed to involve formation of a carbamate cation radical. This hydrolyses to form a phenol which is in turn oxidized, the end product being a substituted dimethylamino-benzoquinoneimine."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2394378997690225460", "cites_id": ["2394378997690225460"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072881803609", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NFP7LgOLOiEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 3, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
