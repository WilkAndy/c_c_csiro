The experimental data were fitted to a number of theoretical isotherms and it was found that the Freundlich and Weber-Matthew models gave the most useful representation. Different parameters of these equations were used for comparative PAH adsorption studies on different fly ash samples.Results indicated that the adsorption of PAHs on fly ash increases with increasing size of the PAH molecule. This work also showed that although the carbon content of the fly ash is the dominant factor in regulating PAH absorption, other controlling factors such as porosity are also important."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5972201649854811336", "cites_id": ["5972201649854811336"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967301973145", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yAyZKsKF4VIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
