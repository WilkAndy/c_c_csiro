First, the study type needs to be determined, and this will lead to a definition of the study scope (spatial boundaries, scale and duration), and the design of the required sampling program to achieve the data requirements. In many cases, sediment investigations are descriptive studies, simply designed to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of contaminants, for \u2018state of the environment\u2019reporting, for compliance monitoring, or to guide management actions such as dredging. In rarer instances, the objective may be to examine contaminant transport and depositional processes. In most instances, the assessment objectives are likely to be driven by regulatory requirements and evaluation of the potential impacts on ecosystem or human health.Quality assurance (QA) needs to be addressed in any assessment exercise. This should include a consideration of the desired sampling and data quality objectives. Standard operating procedures should exist for methods that may be replicated and require audit or review to check compliance against the QA plans. The assessment of data quality objectives will usually require statistical evaluation to ensure that the right type, quantity and quality of environmental data are collected. There are several documents that provide guidance on these matters (for example, ANZECC/ARMCANZ, 2000a; USEPA, 2001, 2006).
