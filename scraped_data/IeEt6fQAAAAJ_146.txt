In this study, we examined the history of metal contamination in sediments using metal analysis and 210Pb and 137Cs dating. The distributions of copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, cadmium and lead concentrations within sediment cores were in agreement with historical events in the lake, and indicated that metal contamination had been occurring since the start of industrial activities in Port Kembla in the late 1800s. Most metal contamination, however, has occurred since the 1960s. Sedimentation rates were found to be 0.2 cm year\u22121 in Griffins Bay and 0.3 cm year\u22121 in the centre of the lake. Inputs from creeks bringing metals from Port Kembla in the northeast of the lake and a copper slag emplacement from a former copper refinery on the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6744958096758193559", "cites_id": ["6744958096758193559"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653514008054", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l70qFqfnml0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
