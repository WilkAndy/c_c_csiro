Samples of Orchard Leaves digested with nitric and sulfuric acids in an open beaker, or dry-ashed in an oxygen plasma furnace at 150 C, gave only 16% and 7%, respectively, of the berylli-um content found when the leaves were digested under re-flux with nitric and sulfuric acids (0.11\u00b10.01 ppm Be). Relatively largeamounts of beryllium were detected in a Diy Ice cold trap inserted between the plasma furnace and the vacuum pump. The analytical method used involved gas chromatographic measurement of the berylli-um trifluoroacetylacetone complex extracted into benzene.This report (1) contained several surprising results. Among these was the observation that volatile beryllium compounds were present both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7742703696204741098", "cites_id": ["7742703696204741098"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac60348a040", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6jljNf2bc2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1975": 1, "1976": 1, "1977": 1, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 4, "1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1}}
