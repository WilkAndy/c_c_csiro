Significant adsorption of added metal was found to occur during over-night extraction with dilute HC1 (pH> 1.5), 0.1 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride (pH 2), 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 4.6), 1 M ammonium acetate, 10% sodium citrate-1% sodium dithionite, and 25% acetic acid. Adsorption also occurred during a hydrogen peroxide digestion procedure. The inability of reagents to prevent losses of soluble metal in these experi-ments strongly suggests that a proportion of the metal actually released from'a sediment sample during an extraction will be readsorbed. This may lead to serious misinterpretation of extraction data because the metal concentrations determined in the extractdo not representmetal levels in the sediment fractions attacked."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 284, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15835195586325938690", "cites_id": ["15835195586325938690"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es60163a002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AoLKv3zqwdsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 8, "1984": 4, "1985": 3, "1986": 8, "1987": 9, "1988": 4, "1989": 9, "1990": 7, "1991": 9, "1992": 9, "1993": 8, "1994": 8, "1995": 14, "1996": 9, "1997": 10, "1998": 11, "1999": 8, "2000": 9, "2001": 9, "2002": 8, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
