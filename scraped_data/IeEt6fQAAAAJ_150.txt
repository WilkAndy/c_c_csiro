Four bioavailability models were compared: the existing European biotic ligand model (European Union BLM) and a softwater BLM, together with 2 newly developed multiple linear regressions (MLRs)\u2014a trophic level\u2010specific MLR and a pooled MLR. Each of the 4 models was used to normalize a nickel ecotoxicity dataset (combined tropical and temperate data) to an index condition of pH 7.5, 6\u2009mg\u2009Ca/L, 4\u2009mg\u2009Mg/L, (i.e., approximately 30\u2009mg\u2009CaCO3/L hardness), and 0.5\u2009mg\u2009DOC/L. The trophic level\u2010specific MLR outperformed the other 3 models, with 79% of the predicted 10% effect concentration (EC10) values within a factor of 2 of the observed EC10 values. All 4 models gave similar normalized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10778926408950486411", "cites_id": ["10778926408950486411"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4885", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ixWSsXVwlpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
