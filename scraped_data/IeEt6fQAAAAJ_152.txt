Recently the focus of this attention has been the contamination of water bodies arising from stormwater runoff. Discussed herein is a project currently being undertaken by the Department of Water Engineering of the School of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales and the Centre for Advanced Analytical Chemistry, CSIRO which is studying stormwater runoff from road surfaces. A particular focus of this study is development of an understanding of the removal of heavy metal pollutant constituents such as Pb, Cu, Zn. A review of available data concluded that insufficient data were available to enable the processes involved to be understood and hence there was a need to establish a field gauging station specific to this problem. Presented in this paper are some details of the field gauging station installed as part of this project \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4654073378484853460", "cites_id": ["4654073378484853460"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.751206275993095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1BoxUxSXlkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2}}
