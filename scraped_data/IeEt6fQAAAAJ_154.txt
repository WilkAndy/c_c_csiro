This peak is caused by a change in the emission background when the easily ionizable element in the matrix is eluted from the HPLC column as a concentrated slug. The effect cannot be attributed to scattered radiation from salt particles, or changes in aerosol transport efficiency or the physical dimension of the plasma."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4964630689057397969", "cites_id": ["4964630689057397969"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267000847455", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0dxE1k7p5UQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1}}
