These have gone some way to addressing the identified deficiencies, and these are reviewed. Revision of the Australian sediment quality guidelines is currently being undertaken. It is recommended that this include changes to the assessment framework to incorporate multiple lines of evidence, chemistry, ecotoxicology, bioaccumulation and ecology in an improved weight of evidence assessment protocol. The revised framework would represent an optional extension to the existing approach, where results are equivocal, but should provide greater certainty in assessing the impacts of exceedances of guideline trigger values. Research needed to further improve guidelines and assessment protocols is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14730531986912183053", "cites_id": ["14730531986912183053"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.665837262744674", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DQNu4MtcbcwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
