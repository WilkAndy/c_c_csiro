{"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "A guide to the application of the ANZECC/ARMCANZ Water Quality Guidelines in the minerals industry", "pub_year": 2003, "citation": "ACMER, 2003", "author": "Graeme E Batley and Graeme E Batley", "publisher": "ACMER", "abstract": "The new ANZECC/ARMCANZ Water Quality Guidelines were introduced in 2000 and represent a major shift in the way surface water quality is managed in Australia.While they represent world\u2019s best practice in terms of water quality management, the biggest problem with the new Guidelines is their apparent complexity. The Guideline package consists of several large volumes of information and provides a complete outline of how the Guidelines should be applied, together with lengthy discussion of the underpinning science. For members of specific industries, accessing the relevant information from this comprehensive package is a daunting, yet necessary task. The aim of this handbook is to simplify this task, by encapsulating in a more easily understandable form, all of the necessary information to the new water quality guidelines. The handbook is written specifically for the minerals industry and uses relevant case study examples to demonstrate key points of the implementation process. The handbook has been developed through extensive consultation with the minerals industry. It is hoped that the handbook will not only be of use to environmental scientists working within the minerals industry but also to consultants, regulators and managers with an interest in water management issues. In view of this broad readership, only the basic descriptions are provided in the main body of the handbook; however, a list of publications is provided for each topic area, for those seeking higher level technical detail. A comprehensive glossary (Appendix 1) is provided to assist the non-specialist reader with the terms used in the Guidelines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8184089528815537838", "cites_id": ["8184089528815537838"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/264552241_A_Practical_Guide_to_the_Application_of_the_ANZECCARMCANZ_Water_Quality_Guidelines_for_the_Mining_Industry/links/5a0363a54585151f478b4b7c/A-Practical-Guide-to-the-Application-of-the-ANZECC-ARMCANZ-Water-Quality-Guidelines-for-the-Mining-Industry.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rk4LtxC6k3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
