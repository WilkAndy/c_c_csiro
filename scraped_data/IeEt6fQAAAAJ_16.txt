The concentration of each species was calculated from measurements using anodic stripping voltammetry of labile and total metal in samples which were (a) untreated, (b) UV irradiated, (c) passed through a chelating resin column, and (d) UV irradiated then passed through a chelating resin column. In the sample studied, the major proportion of Cd, Pb and Cu was found to be associated with organic and inorganic colloidal species. Less than half of the bound Pb and Cu was readily exchangeable with added 210Pb and 64Cu."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 276, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10604102235528699952", "cites_id": ["10604102235528699952"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304420376900207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MCCd3sxWKZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 16, "1984": 18, "1985": 12, "1986": 16, "1987": 8, "1988": 4, "1989": 9, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 7, "1993": 8, "1994": 7, "1995": 6, "1996": 7, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
