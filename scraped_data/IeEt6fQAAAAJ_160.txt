Experimental conditions are given for the quantification of phenols, aromatic amines and certain heterocyclic bases related to piperidine and pyrrolidine, after preliminary separation into acidic, basic and neutral fractions. The technique is applied to the analysis of oil shale retort waters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15053793637886350028", "cites_id": ["15053793637886350028"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967301944528", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zFJAJI7R6dAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
