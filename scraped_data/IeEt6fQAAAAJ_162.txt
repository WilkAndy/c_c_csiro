The reaction is a further example of topochemical heterogeneous catalysis involving diffusion of activated oxygen from the catalyst to the substrate surface. The reaction of platinum-coated zinc sulphide with oxygen is almost instantaneous at temperatures as low as 550 \u00b0C to form ZnO, while in the absence of catalyst slow formation of ZnO occurs only above 620 \u00b0C. The \u201ccatalysis\u201d observed for platinum-coated zinc sulphide is a result of the temperature increase due to catalysis of the reaction of SO2 with oxygen. This reaction and the temperature increase may be arrested by diluting the sample with silica, when the product of reaction with oxygen is again zinc sulphate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4359580529984574895", "cites_id": ["4359580529984574895"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002195177590038X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r5Vw22RXgDwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 1, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
