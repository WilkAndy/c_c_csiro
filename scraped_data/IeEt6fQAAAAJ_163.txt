We present flux estimates for the loss of dimethylselenide from sediments of an anthropogenically affected lake and observe a 6-fold difference between late autumn\u2013early winter and summer. The loss of dimethylselenide represents a significant sediment loss vector, of the same order as the diffusive loss flux for inorganic selenium across the sediment\u2013water interface. Abstract Overflows from ash dams associated with the operation of coal-fired power stations in Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia, have been a historical source of selenium to the lake. Although dissolved selenium concentrations have been marginally elevated, sediments are the major sink. Methylation of sedimentary selenium to volatile dimethylselenide (DMSe) is known to be a natural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9508408669630977252", "cites_id": ["9508408669630977252"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en14228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5FSZrE6n9IMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
