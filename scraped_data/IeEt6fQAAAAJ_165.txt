The hydrazo derivatives of the heterocyclic dyes are more stable with respect to disproportionation, which is attributed to the strongly electron-attracting properties of the pyridyl and thiazolyl groups. In addition their disproportionation is base-catalyzed, whereas earlier studies showed that aromatic azo dyes undergo an acid-catalyzed reaction. Hammett substituent constants were calculated for a variety of heterocyclic groups.Half wave potential shifts were observed for several heterocyclic azo dyes in the presence of nickel and iron(III) ions, and the height of the metal-dye complex wave was proportional to metal concentration. Aluminium did not produce a shift with any \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14429243368428762089", "cites_id": ["14429243368428762089"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072874802810", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6XPb6GT4PsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 1, "1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
