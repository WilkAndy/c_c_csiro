Differential pulse, and fundamental and second harmonic a.c. techniques were applied to the HMDE, while the TFE was studied using a rapid d.c. scan with both in situ and pre-formed mercury films. Particular advantages and problems were identified with each of these anodic stripping techniques. Although a TFE with in situ mercury deposition gave the most sensitive and precise results for many samples, the HMDE in the differential pulse mode was the most versatile and reliable method investigated. The HMDE is less sensitive to solution chemistry than the TFE, and suffers less from interferences caused by inter-element compound formation in the mercury electrode."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 258, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15938112968909532452", "cites_id": ["15938112968909532452"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072874804699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JC3mLU2NL90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 10, "1984": 12, "1985": 9, "1986": 10, "1987": 6, "1988": 7, "1989": 2, "1990": 7, "1991": 3, "1992": 5, "1993": 6, "1994": 5, "1995": 8, "1996": 4, "1997": 8, "1998": 11, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 9, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
