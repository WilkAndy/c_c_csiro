Empirical multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been developed for nickel that can be applied to aquatic organisms. The MLR models have been compared against the use of previously developed biotic ligand models (BLMs) for the normalization of an ecotoxicity dataset compiled for the derivation of a water quality guideline value that could be applied in Australia and New Zealand. The MLR models were developed from data for a number of specific species and were validated independently to confirm their reliability. An MLR modeling approach using different models for algae, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates performed better than either a pooled MLR model for all taxa or the BLMs, in terms of its ability to correctly predict the results of the tests in the ecotoxicity database based on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:5bg8sr1QxYwC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4562374798552485735", "cites_id": ["4562374798552485735"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4900", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z0_q77TPUD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
