To aid environmental management, temperate data are usually extrapolated to other climatic (e.g., tropical) regions. However, differences in climate, water chemistry, and endemic biota between temperate and tropical systems make such extrapolations uncertain. Chronic nickel (Ni) toxicity data were compiled for temperate (24 species) and tropical (16 species) marine biota and their sensitivities to Ni compared. Concentrations to cause a 10% effect for temperate biota ranged from 2.9 to 20 300\u2009\u00b5g\u2009Ni/L, with sea urchin larval development being the most sensitive endpoint. Values for tropical data ranged from 5.5 to 3700\u2009\u00b5g\u2009Ni/L, with copepod early\u2013life stage development being the most sensitive test. There was little difference in temperate and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2828272193544841523", "cites_id": ["2828272193544841523"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4880", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M-laQJMKQCcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
