While in the past the focus has typically been on total contaminant concentrations, the quality of the chemistry assessment can be significantly enhanced by the use of measures that probe the chemical forms, partitioning and bioavailability of contaminants. This chapter discusses the current best practice approaches to the chemistry line of evidence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4985838826549500175", "cites_id": ["4985838826549500175"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=l1Z3CwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA47&dq=info:D1nVI_9BMUUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=AsGh3eBEH3&sig=qU3B7hxI4gJ1tp50QdDZ_drKOtc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D1nVI_9BMUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
