Forbes and Forbes (1994) define ecotoxicology as \u2018the field of study which integrates the ecological and toxicological effects of chemical pollutants in populations, communities and ecosystems with the fate (transport, transformation and breakdown) of such pollutants in the environment\u2019. Ecotoxicologists acquire information by both laboratory testing (bioassays) and field studies, which may involve individual organisms, communities and populations. Both approaches have a role to play in understanding the effects of contaminants on living organisms. Laboratory bioassays may examine acute or chronic organism responses and may use various endpoints such as lethality or suppression of growth. Biomarkers of organism stress may also be employed to measure the sub-lethal effects of contaminants on organisms.Ecotoxicology plays a central role in the testing and regulation of new substances. Safety evaluations carried out in most developed countries include ecotoxicity tests to enable some assessment of the risk to the environment (eg acute toxicity to fish, invertebrates and algae). A number of standard test procedures have been adopted internationally and are used for the testing of new substances (OECD, 2006).
