Pore waters from frozen estuarine sediment cores contained up to eighty times the selenium content of those extracted from chilled but unfrozen cores. Experiments suggested that the increase in selenium concentrations resulted from rupturing the cells of selenium-accumulating bacteria present in the samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14131273691522852456", "cites_id": ["14131273691522852456"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X04000694", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aOYKP41eHMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
