Consideration of metal species would provide a better estimation of bioavailability of the metal. Because the solubility of sparingly soluble metals, metal compounds and minerals depends on the dissolution conditions, aquatic toxicity tests may produce different results depending on the protocol used for the preparation of the test solutions. This paper considers critical aspects of the physical and chemical processes associated with dissolution. The kinetics and equilibria associated with the dissolution of sparingly soluble metals, metal compounds and minerals are reviewed, with special reference to the influence of grinding of materials. This is of importance in the regulatory classification of sparingly soluble compounds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13135682261139516270", "cites_id": ["13135682261139516270"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10807039709383696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:buuesWtRS7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
