We have now examined a corresponding series of beryllium complexes of bidentate and quadridentate Schiff bases, some of which have been previously prepared by Green et al. 3-5 incidentally to a study of their formation constants in solution. The properties of the complexes with bidentate Schiff bases are consistent with the expected monomeric, 4-coordinate structures, but those derived from polymethylenediamines have properties which show that their structures depend upon adjustment of the ligand stereochemistry to the requirements of the beryllium atom for a tetrahedral environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8454444959552608432", "cites_id": ["8454444959552608432"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/263017387_Beryllium_complexes_with_bidentate_and_quadridentate_Schiff_bases/links/53e435e00cf2fb748710b3a5/Beryllium-complexes-with-bidentate-and-quadridentate-Schiff-bases.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sJg5q-U4VHUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1978": 1, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
