In a range of materials tested in the laboratory, Teflon and polycarbonate were found to be the most efficient collector materials. Laboratory optimisation experiments indicated that the deposition of oxyhydroxides on both materials occurred quickly (<2 weeks). In the field, oxyhydroxides were collected on Teflon sheets as depositional bands just below the sediment-water interface. These bands were much wider and more variable (1\u20135 cm) than those observed in laboratory experiments (typically 0.5 cm). This was attributed to the frequently changing redox conditions at the field sites caused by a combination of sediment movement and tidal processes. The deposits collected were predominantly iron with lesser amounts of manganese. At several sites strong correlations were observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9600711223702151303", "cites_id": ["9600711223702151303"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593331908616779", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h2Dfv_2TPIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
