The stability, dissolution rates and toxicity of citrate- and polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were investigated in synthetic freshwater and natural seawater media, with the effects of natural organic matter investigated in freshwater. When sterically stabilised by the large PVP molecules, AgNPs were more stable than when charge-stabilised using citrate, and were even relatively stable in seawater. In freshwater and seawater, citrate-coated AgNPs (Ag\u2013Cit) had a faster rate of dissolution than PVP-coated AgNPs (Ag\u2013PVP), while micron-sized silver exhibited the slowest dissolution rate. However, similar dissolved silver was measured for both AgNPs after 72 h in freshwater (500\u2013600 \u03bcg L\u22121) and seawater (1300\u20131500 \u03bcg L\u22121), with higher concentrations in seawater attributed to chloride \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 244, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4217723246172736854", "cites_id": ["4217723246172736854"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513007212", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vo0IKfJciDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 12, "2015": 28, "2016": 31, "2017": 30, "2018": 27, "2019": 26, "2020": 31, "2021": 21, "2022": 20, "2023": 15}}
