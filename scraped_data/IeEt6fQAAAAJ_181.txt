It was observed that at constant acid concentration the rate of exchange was enhanced by the addition of sulphate. It was also found that with increasing sulphuric acid concentration the rate of exchange at first decreased, but then increased again as the sulphuric acid concentration increased beyond 1 M. Reaction mechanisms consistent with the observed results are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13837390755060852682", "cites_id": ["13837390755060852682"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022190274802836", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yiet_ZNJCMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 1, "1978": 1, "1979": 0, "1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
