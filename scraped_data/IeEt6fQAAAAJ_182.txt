Indices of \u2018\u2018unhealthiness\u2019\u2019can also be used (eg, Malloy et al. 2007). Despite advances in many areas of environmental science, assessment of ecosystem health appears to have advanced little over the past 20 years, except perhaps in the ways data are analyzed. Studies typically rely on the physical separation of macroscopic organisms from waters or sediments, then identifying and counting them. The process is time consuming, labor intensive, and costly, which has severely limited the use of ecological information in environmental impact assessment in favor of more readily obtained chemical and ecotoxicological data. This ignores the fact that ecological studies present a unifying perspective by reflecting how biological communities, rather than individual test species, respond to environmental perturbations.More and more, ecological assessments are not being used as stand-alone studies, but integrated with other lines of evidence (LOEs)(eg, chemistry, ecotoxicology, and bioaccumulation) in a weight-of-evidence approach (Chapman et al. 2002). In such studies, elevated contaminant concentrations, where toxicity has also been identified, could be more confidently assessed as being at risk if, as well, ecological studies showed that the ecosystem was degraded or unhealthy. The combination of the different LOEs places less rigorous constraints on the output of the ecological LOE.
