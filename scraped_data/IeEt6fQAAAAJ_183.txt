Maher", "journal": "Environmental Chemistry", "volume": "6", "pages": "273-274", "abstract": "The term speciation, originally coined to describe evolutionary processes leading to new biological species, is now also used in the chemical sciences to refer to the distribution of the different forms or species of a particular element. Speciation is also often used to describe the measurement of chemical species, although use of the more descriptive \u2018speciation analysis\u2019 has been advocated.[1] In environmental chemistry, a knowledge of speciation is critical to understanding the transport, accumulation, bioavailability and toxicity of elements within and between the environmental compartments of air, soil, water, sediments and biota.In its broadest sense, speciation encompasses all chemical elements, although for historical reasons the term is more commonly used for studies dealing with metals or metalloids. The term became more widely used in the environmental sciences from the 1960s, when studies on mercury-contaminated aquatic systems showed that inorganic mercury was readily methylated by natural microbial processes to methylmercury, a species of mercury more bioavailable to organisms and more toxic to humans than was inorganic mercury. Similar studies followed for other metals and metalloids. These studies demonstrated that knowledge of speciation was integral to understanding the behaviour, fate and effects of metals in environmental systems. Increasingly, the term speciation is being applied to non-metals as well, for example investigation of halogen or nitrogen species in atmospheric processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7219592150688935485", "cites_id": ["7219592150688935485"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ce4cfb926112397ec52a17601232e94b3faa9a58", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PS4DXc8kMWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2}}
