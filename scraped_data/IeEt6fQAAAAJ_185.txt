Regulatory concerns arise from their potential toxicity to aquatic biota and detriment to human health through ingestion of waters and contaminated foodstuffs. Water quality legislation (eg, ANZECC/ARMCANZ, 2000; US Federal Register, 1998; Gardner and Zabel, 1989) normally focuses on regulating dissolved metals because these are considered to be the most bioavailable to aquatic organisms (Campbell, 1995; Luoma, 1983). The trace metals of greatest concern include aluminium, arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, mercury, selenium, silver, and zinc. The maximum tolerable concentrations, as defined by various water quality guidelines, typically are in the 1 to 100 g/liter range; however, some forms of organometallic compounds (eg, methylmercury and tributyltin) are highly toxic at quite low (nanogram per liter) concentrations.Metals have both natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural background concentrations largely are determined by catchment geology and can be very variable (Jacinski, 1995). The waters draining mineralized regions may contain naturally elevated metal concentrations. For example, surface waters in the geothermal regions of New Zealand contain high concentrations of arsenic and mercury (Craw et al., 2000). Acid-rock drainage resulting from the natural weathering of sulfidic ores can be responsible for elevated dissolved metal concentrations in some water bodies (Furniss et al., 1999). Anthropogenic sources of metals include point-source inputs such as industrial discharges, sewage treatment effluents, mining discharges (eg, tailings, waste \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16921814628955463996", "cites_id": ["16921814628955463996"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-Maher/publication/264552338_Monitoring_of_trace_metals_and_metalloids_in_natural_waters/links/550503200cf231de077578d3/Monitoring-of-trace-metals-and-metalloids-in-natural-waters.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PCHm2b9c1uoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
