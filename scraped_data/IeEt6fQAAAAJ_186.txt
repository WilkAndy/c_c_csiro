In the northern lake-Sediment contamination by lead and zinc from the nearby smelter, extends beyond 50 cm depth at some points. Despite the obvious impacts of such high metal levels on sedimentfdwelling animals, there is evidence of a reduced metal load in recent sediments, and seagrasses and shellfish appear to be recolonizing the near~ shore regions. Further south, sewage treatment plants and power station ash dams and cooling water discharges will also Contribute metals to the lake system, however there is no evidence that the concentrations are adversely affecting aquatic= life. Urban runoff is also a source of heavy metals as are antifouling paints on recreational boats. Nevertheless, the dissolved concentrations of heavy metals in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1425544493084864113", "cites_id": ["1425544493084864113"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1425544493084864113&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cW7W4SmNyBMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
