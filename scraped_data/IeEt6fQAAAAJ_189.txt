This contamination is frequently overlain and mixed with more recent urban contamination. The remediation of contaminated sites is often a very expensive exercise and the final remediation criteria often reflect a trade-off between protecting human and ecological health and the finances of those deemed responsible for the site clean-up. In this study, we describe an assessment of estuarine sediments impacted historically by contamination from a gasworks site. The major historical sediment contaminants included polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other petroleum-related hydrocarbons (TRHs). Elevated concentrations of metals exist throughout the city region due to historical pollution and ongoing urban stormwater discharges.
