The Study began in October 1992 and finished in June 1996. The Port Phillip Bay Environmental Study was managed by CSIRO and supervised by a Management Committee chaired by the (then) Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Also represented on the committee were the EPA, Melbourne Water, Melbourne Parks and Waterways and the former Port of Melbourne Authority.
