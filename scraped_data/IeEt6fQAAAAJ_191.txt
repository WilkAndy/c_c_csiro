Initial experiments compared uptake of Se with algal cell number after deposit-feeding (Tellina deltoidalis) and filter-feeding (Soletellina alba) bivalves were exposed for 12 days under 16:8 h light:dark and 24-hour dark regimes to sediments amended with Se (17 mg/kg dry weight). Comparisons of filter-feeding with deposit-feeding organisms indicated >2-fold higher body burdens in the deposit-feeding organisms after 12 days. Darkness failed to significantly and consistently diminish algal cell densities. However, general trends indicated a decrease of pelagic algal numbers in +Se/dark treatments during the 12-day exposure.
