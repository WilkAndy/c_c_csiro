No interferences were obtained from metal ions, or chloride, nitrate or phosphate ions when a back-washing method was applied to the sample extract. The method allows the determination of long-chain tertiary amines down to 4 ppM."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9171170678435525089", "cites_id": ["9171170678435525089"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039914073800074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4bGgHiSLRn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
