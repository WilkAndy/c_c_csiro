DSTP discharges consist of a slurry of mine tailings solids (finely crushed rock) and residual process liquor containing low concentrations of metals, metalloids, flotation agents and flocculants. This slurry can potentially affect both pelagic and benthic biota inhabiting coastal waters, the continental slope and the deep-sea bed. Building on a conceptual model of DSTP exposure pathways and receptors, we developed a stressor-driven environmental risk assessment (ERA) framework using causal pathways/causal networks for each of eight pelagic and benthic impact zones. For the risk characterisation, each link in each causal pathway in each zone was scored using four levels of likelihood (not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12310682709690387774", "cites_id": ["12310682709690387774"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722044096", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Po2jHbNU2KoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 6}}
