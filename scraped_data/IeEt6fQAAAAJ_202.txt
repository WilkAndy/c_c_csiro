Catalyst activity was found to depend on the nature of the support, its surface area and particle size, and the concentration of metal on the support. The activation energy for the dissociative adsorption of oxygen is low on those metals and metal oxides which are effective catalysts. Variation in catalytic activity is attributable to differences in the entropy of oxygen adsorption on these surfaces, since the activation energies for the catalyzed reactions were found to be the same irrespective of the catalyst used."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6419599044090045089,2668511128732546276", "cites_id": ["6419599044090045089", "2668511128732546276"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951774900499", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oaJsb1H_FlkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1974": 1, "1975": 1, "1976": 0, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 1, "1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 2}}
