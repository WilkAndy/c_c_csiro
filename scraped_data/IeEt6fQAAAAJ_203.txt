These reaction products, collectively termed chlorine\u2010produced oxidants (CPOs), can be toxic to marine biota. Because the lifetime of the most toxic forms is limited to several days, appropriate guideline values need to be based on short\u2010term (acute) toxicity tests, rather than chronic tests. Flow\u2010through toxicity tests that provide continuous CPO exposure are the most appropriate, whereas static\u2010renewal tests generate variable exposure and effects depending on the renewal rate. There are literature data for acute CPO toxicity from flow\u2010through tests, together with values from 2 sensitive 15\u2010min static tests on 30 species from 9 taxonomic groups. These values were used in a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9055203902649606158", "cites_id": ["9055203902649606158"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4661", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DiApEvmLqn0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
