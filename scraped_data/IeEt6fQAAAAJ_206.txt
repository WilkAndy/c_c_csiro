The purpose of this study was to use a multi-proxy method to evaluate the extent and trends of historical metal inputs from a coal-fired power station to sediments in Lake Budgewoi. Metal concentrations in 15-cm sediment cores showed a uniform depth profile. The highest concentrations of zinc and copper were found close to the Munmorah Power Station outlet, while arsenic and lead were found in the deposition basin of sediments. Background values for metal concentrations of Zn < 80 mg/kg, As < 15 mg/kg, Se < 1 mg/kg, Cu < 16 mg/kg, Cd < 0.8 mg/kg and Pb < 20 mg/kg were used as the baseline for future studies in this lake. The history of sediment metal concentrations is consistent with power station \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3604773520064334442", "cites_id": ["3604773520064334442"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857415302093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:akor52q6BjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
