However, the Murray-Darling Basin is currently experiencing the worst drought on record. The River Murray, adjacent wetlands and the Lower Lakes are being seriously impacted by a combination of low water levels and the presence of acid sulfate soils (ASS): soils that either contain sulfuric acid or have the potential to form sulfuric acid, sufficient to generate a soil pH of less than pH 4.0, when exposed to oxygen in the air through disturbance or drying. The re-wetting of ASS that have dried and oxidised as a result of lowered water levels is likely to cause high concentrations of trace metals to be dissolved and released to surface waters.
