It cannot be assumed that nanomaterials entering aquatic environments will have the same impacts on aquatic biota as their macroscopic particle equivalents. If their toxicities are different, this will have implications for the way in which nanomaterial usage is regulated. Algae, at the bottom of the food chain, are likely to be a sensitive indicator of toxic effects. Understanding the physical and chemical factors controlling nanoparticle toxicity to algae will assist in evaluating their ecological risk. Abstract. In assessing the risks posed by nanomaterials in the environment, the overriding research challenges are to determine if nanomaterials are more toxic than the bulk forms of the same material, and the extent to which toxicity is governed by particle size and reactivity. In this study, the toxicity of nanoparticulate CeO2 (nominally 10\u201320 nm) to the freshwater alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 215, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4834679074495164078", "cites_id": ["4834679074495164078"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/EN/EN09123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rm5MxgA7GEMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 16, "2013": 21, "2014": 22, "2015": 19, "2016": 21, "2017": 13, "2018": 12, "2019": 16, "2020": 24, "2021": 20, "2022": 7, "2023": 11}}
