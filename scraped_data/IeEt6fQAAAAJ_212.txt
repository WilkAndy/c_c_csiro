An outer polymer coating was used in the polymerisation step to prevent'loss of volatile components. Electrodes prepared using a high porosity graphite showed good a.s.v. sensitivities for Cd, Pb and Cu but a low sensitivity for Zn. The best electrodes used a hard, low porosity graphite, Poco FX1, impregnated with a methyl methacrylate-epoxy resin mixture. They exhibited good reproducibility and stability in acid solutions and were comparable in behaviour to glassy carbon."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4837809954253479829", "cites_id": ["4837809954253479829"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072877804099", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lZ8ghoVaI0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
