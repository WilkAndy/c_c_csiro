However, the main focus is on standards for the protection of organisms that live in water or aquatic sediment and are able to absorb contaminants directly via their gills, skin, and/or cell surfaces. In other words, the chapter primarily covers the derivation of standards for the protection of aquatic ecosystems. The objective of aquatic EQSs is to assist environmental managers in either maintaining or improving the quality of a water body by identifying the chemical contamination that might lead to or might have caused deterioration, quantifying its severity, and locating the source of damage. It is best not to use EQSs in isolation; ideally, they should be used as lines of evidence in an environmental assessment. There will usually need to be a range of EQSs available to assist the attainment of a range of protection goals for different water bodies or sections of water bodies. Thus, aquatic EQSs may well include values to protect freshwater and/or marine pelagic ecosystems, freshwater and/or marine benthic ecosystems, and/or the food chain dependent on aquatic organisms. There may also be a need to consider amenities such as bathing or drinking water quality, although in some regions drinking water quality is considered through a different regulatory process. There is a need to be protective of raw water as a potential source of drinking water abstraction (even though it will usually then be subject to treatment), and in certain countries this is achieved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7463629934043905920", "cites_id": ["7463629934043905920"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=XFS4WCUwGVsC&oi=fnd&pg=PA47&dq=info:gL-oieEjlGcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=g57FJmEwvJ&sig=atd09R7a9svXFgmwfpA2M9EV5AQ", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gL-oieEjlGcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
