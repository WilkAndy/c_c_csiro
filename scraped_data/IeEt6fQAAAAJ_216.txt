In its simplest form it involves the measurement of total metal loads in compartments of the environment such as water, sediment, soil and biota. To increase the certainty of any risk or hazard predictions, total metal determinations need to be refined to relate to that portion of the total that is eliciting the impact. This will require measurements of bioavailable fractions coupled with a consideration of the stability and fate of these fractions, their environmental heterogeneity and temporal variability. The latter will define the exposure duration and will link with effects data in predicting risk. Sampling to measure these parameters is the most critical step in exposure assessment, and guidance on appropriate techniques for this and for bioavailable metal analyses are discussed.*"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8614333839697131024", "cites_id": ["8614333839697131024"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/264790207_Exposure_assessment_of_metal_contaminants/links/53f18d370cf23733e815bba3/Exposure-assessment-of-metal-contaminants.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EDbGi_xCjHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
