The method was used to detect sewage pollution and trace sewage plumes in coastal waters and encouraging results were obtained. An automated monitor was being developed for routine application of the method for detection of coliforms in drinking water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13525111820209276118,13739750446096900673", "cites_id": ["13525111820209276118", "13739750446096900673"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13525111820209276118&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1sQCl4rZsrsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
