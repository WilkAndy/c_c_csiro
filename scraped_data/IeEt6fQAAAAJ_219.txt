This is assessed by evaluating known environmental concentrations against available toxicity data. In most instances risks are low with current usage. Areas are identified where additional data are needed.Abstract The environmental concentrations and aquatic toxicity of a range of technology-critical metals comprising platinum group and rare earth group elements, together with gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, niobium, rhenium, tantalum, tellurium and thallium, have been reviewed to determine whether they pose a risk to aquatic ecosystem health. There is a reasonable body of toxicity data for most, but the quality is quite variable, and more data are required. Chronic toxicity EC10 or NOEC values are generally in the low mg L\u20131 range, far higher than the current \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15558900579963506551", "cites_id": ["15558900579963506551"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/EN/EN22030", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dw9YlKRR7NcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
