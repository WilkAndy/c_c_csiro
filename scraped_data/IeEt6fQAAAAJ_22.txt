Past evaluations of available SQGs for metals indicated little difference in their predictive abilities; however, the scientific understanding of cause\u2010effect relationships is progressing rapidly. Today, it is clear that they can be protective of benthic ecosystem health, but single\u2010value SQGs will be ineffective for predicting the toxicity of metals in sediments. Recent exposure\u2010effects models and the sediment biotic ligand model both indicate that a better approach would be to have SQG concentrations, or ranges, that are applied to different sediment types. This review indicates that significant improvements in laboratory and field\u2010based measurements, better recording of parameters that influence metal toxicity in sediments, as well as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 210, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12360169214246224288", "cites_id": ["12360169214246224288"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ieam.5630030103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oIHd0mkkiKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 10, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 10, "2012": 15, "2013": 14, "2014": 18, "2015": 9, "2016": 19, "2017": 16, "2018": 17, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
