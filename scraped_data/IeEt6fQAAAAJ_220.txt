Given the rapid decomposition of chlorine, initially as hypochlorite and then as chloramine, it is appropriate to consider a guideline value based on short\u2010term (acute) toxicity rather than one based on longer\u2010term chronic data, as has been recommended for chlorine in marine waters. The literature on the fate of chlorine in drinking water discharged to freshwaters and on the ecotoxicity of total residual chlorine has been reviewed, and on the basis of this, revised default guideline values were derived for both hypochlorite and chloramine in freshwater using a species sensitivity distribution of toxicity data. The values for 95% species protection were 7 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3258774925594964330", "cites_id": ["3258774925594964330"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4984", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:arEJc4d-OS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
