Aquatic organisms may experience different toxic effects from exposure to dissolved and particulate trace metals. This study investigates how concentration, reaction time and changes to precipitate composition/mineral formation affect copper solubility in seawater, thus influencing metal bioavailability and toxicity in the field and laboratory. Abstract A lack of knowledge on the solubility of metals such as copper affects the ability to predict the forms (dissolved and particulate) that organisms are exposed to in field and laboratory waters. Laboratory tests were conducted where copper (total concentrations of 0.5 to 20\u2009mg L\u22121) was added to natural and artificial seawater (pH 8.15, 22\u2009\u00b0C), equilibrated for 28 days and dissolved copper monitored at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5852469418746294803", "cites_id": ["5852469418746294803"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN20133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E7I1u-0lOFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
