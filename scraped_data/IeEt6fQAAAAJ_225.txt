The corer\u2013reactor permits measurements, under controlled laboratory conditions, on intact, largely undisturbed sediment cores, without significantly perturbing the physical and chemical conditions found in the field. The design can be constructed in\u2010house for around US$240 (A$400) (excluding motor and corer lid), making it a relatively inexpensive system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11051019110353401420", "cites_id": ["11051019110353401420"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2003.1905", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TPaqflQbXZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
