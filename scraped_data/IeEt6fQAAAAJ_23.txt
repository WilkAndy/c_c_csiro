While the relative merits of kinetic and equilibrium approaches are still being determined, advances in the applications of stripping voltammetry, including the application of microelectrodes and an appreciation of detection windows in both CSV and ASV, have been matched by the introduction of new dynamic techniques including diffusive gradients in thin films (DGTs), permeation liquid membranes (PLMs), and improved applications of chelating resins. There have also been improvements in equilibrium techniques such as ion-selective electrodes and Donnan dialysis. The ability of geochemical speciation models to predict metal complexation by natural organic matter has greatly improved, yet the models still require validation against \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=683336875652634864", "cites_id": ["683336875652634864"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH04095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Fgzl0SzewkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 8, "2006": 5, "2007": 15, "2008": 17, "2009": 13, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 15, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 14, "2016": 19, "2017": 10, "2018": 10, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
