It is the home to more than 75% of its population and the site of most of its cities. It fosters a marine industry worth over $16 billion annually, including $4.5 billion in exports, as well as being the location for most of the country's heavy industry.The coastal zone has been variously defined on the basis of specific issues, but a convenient definition confines it to the area extending seawards to 12 nautical miles or to the 10 metre depth contour, whichever is the furthest from shore, and extending landwards to include all coastal lands, at least to the limit of those local government areas adjoining tidal waters. This zone provides sites for a wider range of uses and functions than any other part of the continent. These include residential and commercial use, recreational use, commercial fishing, ports (about 120 in all) and sea transport,\u2022 waste disposal, tourism, conservation of natural environments and industrial uses such as cooling, salt production, pulp production, mining and agriculture. It is the basis of many of Australia's leisure activities and tourist industries and contains unique ecologies such as the Great Barrier Reef. It is the breeding site for hundreds of species of fish, birds and reptiles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10620974882572479110", "cites_id": ["10620974882572479110"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/264878156_Defining_and_quantifying_national_coastal_resources/links/53f470ea0cf22be01c3eb7d5/Defining-and-quantifying-national-coastal-resources.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hioUJGJIZZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1}}
