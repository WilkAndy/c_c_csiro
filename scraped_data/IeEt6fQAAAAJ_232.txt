The problems associated with their separation and measurement are discussed in relation to the partitioning of endosulfan and its degradation products between sediments, colloids and solution in natural freshwaters. Other chemical and physical degradation pathways that im-pact on the methods of storage and analysis of endosulfan-containing samples are discussed. Hydrolysis reactions are relatively rapid, suggesting samples should be extracted as soon as possible after collection."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11703264378115332894", "cites_id": ["11703264378115332894"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11703264378115332894&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HhsMAvJYaqIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2}}
