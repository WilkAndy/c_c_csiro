This committee has now been in-volved in the coordination of a variety of investigative programs into the nature of the dirty water problem and the removal of manganese from drinking waters. Aspects of source water quality, treat-ment plant operation and reticulation sys-tem maintenance which are relevant to the issue of manganese related water quality problems are discussed. \u00feNTRODUCTION The presence of excessive levels of nuanganese in drinking-water is undesirable be-cause it leads to manganese deposition on pipe surfaces and to water of poor aesthetic quality.
