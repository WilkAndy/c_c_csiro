It has proved invaluable in environmental analysis, for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures of contaminants in waters, sediments and biota. This review discusses the recent advances in the technology of HPLC including the growing range of detection systems, and examines its application to the analysis of contaminants of environmental concern."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16837782488564905854", "cites_id": ["16837782488564905854"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16837782488564905854&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fjc0hPbRq-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1}}
