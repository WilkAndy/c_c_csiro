Using an adequate toxicity dataset and applying the latest model-averaging software will yield values of greatest reliability.Abstract The development of the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) more than 30\u2009years ago was in direct response to the many criticisms concerning the use of subjective Assessment (or Application) Factors (AFs) in widespread use at the time. While not perfect, SSD modelling is statistically defensible whereas AFs are not. While intuitively appealing, we believe recent guidance recommending the use of AFs in conjunction with SSD modelling is concerning and has the potential to impose unnecessary, time-consuming and expensive follow-up investigations on both regulators and the regulated.
