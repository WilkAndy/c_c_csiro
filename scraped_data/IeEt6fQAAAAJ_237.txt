Tropical and temperate marine biota have sensitivity to arsenate covering three to four orders of magnitude due to the range of arsenate detoxification mechanisms used to reduce toxicity. The water quality guideline values derived in this study will contribute to robust risk assessments of arsenate in marine environments.Rationale There are very few high-quality chronic inorganic arsenate (AsV) toxicity data to assess the risks to marine ecosystems. We aimed to determine the range in chronic toxicity of AsV to marine biota and derive reliable water quality guideline values (GVs) for the long-term protection of marine ecosystems.Methodology We generated chronic toxicity data based on measured dissolved (<0.45\u2009\u00b5m filtered) AsV \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4031967756652462841", "cites_id": ["4031967756652462841"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN22039", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-UIZ-U9t9DcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
