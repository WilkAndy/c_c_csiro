The site is characterised by acid mine drainage produced through pyrite and chalcopyrite in the pit walls, waste rock and tailings. In addition, there are a number of water storages from previous operations that contain poor quality water, including two evaporation ponds and the larger water storage in the open pit. It is proposed to discharge treated water into Mount Bundey Creek during either the wet season (when there is sufficient dilution capacity) or the dry season and/or provide water to a third party for potential agricultural and horticultural uses, both of which will require water treatment prior to discharge to meet agreed beneficial uses and water quality guidelines.Primary Gold requested that CSIRO assess the suitability of the site-specific trigger values (SSTVs) derived by GHD in 2015 and, if required, re-derive trigger values for physical and chemical indicators appropriate to the proposed range of beneficial uses of on-site water. The aim was to assist Primary Gold with their water management strategy, particularly to help maintain a neutral water balance and appropriately dispose of any legacy wastewaters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:ziOE8S1-AIUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8524312108532904001", "cites_id": ["8524312108532904001"], "pub_url": "https://ntepa.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/797022/supplement_eis_toms_gully_appendixF_update_site_specific_trigger_values.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QTCq77JwTHYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
