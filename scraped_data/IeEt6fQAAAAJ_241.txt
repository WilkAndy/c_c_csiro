During these exercises, it is not uncommon to hear my ecotoxicologist and ecologist colleagues refer to \u2018the chemistry\u2019of waters or sediments, as if it was a one-line or even onenumber parameter categorizing the sample, that can be used in conjunction with their biological studies. This simplistic view fails to acknowledge that a sample\u2019s (or system\u2019s) chemistry is not just a single measurement of one or more chemical components, but embraces an understanding of the dynamics, persistence, reactivity, degradation, transformation, and speciation of these components and their products. Why is this important? Clearly concentration alone will be insufficient to describe or predict the effects of a contaminant on an ecosystem. Rather, the effects will be determined by the exposure dose which is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16170129011661384097", "cites_id": ["16170129011661384097"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/263026173_Chemistry_-_More_than_a_One-Line_Item/links/53d819130cf2a19eee81515f/Chemistry-More-than-a-One-Line-Item.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oalQwKnWZ-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
