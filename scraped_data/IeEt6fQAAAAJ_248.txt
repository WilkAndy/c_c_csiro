Current water quality guideline values for iron in fresh water are based on analytical determinations of filterable or total iron. Filtration, however, can underestimate bioavailable iron by retaining some of the colloidal fraction, and total determinations overestimate bioavailable iron measurements by recovering fractions of low bioavailability from suspended solids (e.g., iron oxides and oxyhydroxides) naturally abundant in many surface waters. Consequently, there is a need for an analytical method that permits the determination of a bioavailable iron fraction, while avoiding false\u2010negative and false\u2010positive results. Ideally, a measurement technique is required that can be readily applied by commercial laboratories and field \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14425614445350968257", "cites_id": ["14425614445350968257"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.5530", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wVvjaegTMsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
