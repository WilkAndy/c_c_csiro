Understanding selenium cycling allows risk assessment to be undertaken and appropriate action to protect resident organisms.Abstract The fate of selenium (Se) inputs from coal-fired power station operations in a marine dominated estuary, Lake Macquarie NSW, is explored, as well as Se toxicity, including sublethal and population effects. Selenium is rapidly adsorbed to sediments, and food webs are based on benthic food sources. Selenium is remobilised from sediments by volatilisation and diffusional processes following bioturbation. It is then transferred into \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1222059581307612471", "cites_id": ["1222059581307612471"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN22032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N-0z5rag9RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
