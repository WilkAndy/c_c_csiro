ET&C Focus article [1] is a very timely piece given the review of the method used by the USEPA to derive water quality criteria (WQC;[2]), and also because of the ongoing push for increased international harmonization of derivation methods for WQC (and their analogues in other jurisdictions)(eg [3, 4, 5]). Buchwalter et al.[1] provide a cogent argument not only for the expansion of the definition of data that are acceptable to derive WQC, but also for a more holistic paradigm to deriving WQC."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14300501243016958567", "cites_id": ["14300501243016958567"], "pub_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/response-to-buchwalter-et-al-further-considerations-for-modernisi", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z9IO_ByWdcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
