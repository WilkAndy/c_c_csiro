Mark\u2019s forty-five year research career was founded on chemistry, principally analytical chemistry, but encompassed the applications of chemistry to environmental, occupational hygiene, and health science. These are reflected in his extensive list of widely cited publications. This volume contains contributions from colleagues and associates with whom he interacted during his career. Mark published his first paper, on a spectophotometric method for nickel, soon after joining the Chemistry Division of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) in 1957. Using one of the first cathode ray polarographs in Australia, he developed a method for uranium ore analysis, the beginning of a fascination with electroanalytical chemistry. He applied polarography to the analysis of lanthanides based on their complexation with azo dyes.
