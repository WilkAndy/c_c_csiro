Over this period, in excess of 100 million cubic metres of tallings, slag and topsoil were deposited in the King River and Macquarie Harbour (Figure 1) resulting in extensive copper contamination of waters and sediments. Waste material also accumulated along the banks of the King River and formed a large, unstable delta where the river enters the harbour. Copper concentrations are still very high in the King River largely as a result of continuing inputs from the mine lease site. In addition,'small quantities of copper are also released from the deposited waste material both on the river banks and the delta. Part of this release is associated with acid generation caused by the oxidation of pyrite.As part of the development of a remediation strategy, the Mount Lyell Remediation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8221855265874311475", "cites_id": ["8221855265874311475"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8221855265874311475&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M_kclc3lGXIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
