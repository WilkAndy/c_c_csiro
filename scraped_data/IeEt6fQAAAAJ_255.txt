Resin separations using Chelex-100 tend to overestimate the bioavailable fraction, however aluminium hydroxide-coated cation exchange resins provide a better estimate. Anodic stripping voltammetry of water samples at the natural pH detects a labile copper fraction that approximates the fraction bioavailable to sensitive algae or bacteria. This together with the measurement of copper complexing capacity are important chemical in defining the environmental behaviour of copper in waters. Size-based separations using filtration and dialysis can also provide useful information. Advances in bioassays that reduce both their cost and time hold promise as a more meaningful measure of bioavailable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9008610273932300135", "cites_id": ["9008610273932300135"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/264742025_Analytical_methods_for_copper_speciation/links/53ed3e060cf2981ada1618c5/Analytical-methods-for-copper-speciation.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z0-rgVADBX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
