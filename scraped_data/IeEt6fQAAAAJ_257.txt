Their inputs include urban run-off, industrial effluents, mining operations and atmospheric depositions, and may be in particulate or dissolved forms. Although many are essential biological elements, all have the potential to be toxic to organisms above certain threshold concentrations, and for the protection of aquatic biota it is important that these limits not be exceeded in aquatic environments. devoted to methods which can detect specific species classes whose biological impacts can be predicted (Florence & Batley 1980). There are limited measurements of the speciation of metals in waters, but for the most part data are available only for total metal concentrations. These usually refer to the dissolved metal concentrations defined by filtration through a 0.45 um membrane filter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12325453744582043506", "cites_id": ["12325453744582043506"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12325453744582043506&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cidSreDODKsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
