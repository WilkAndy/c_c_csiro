It is possible to study the depositional reactions of iron and manganese, and associated heavy metals, from pore waters by inserting plastic collector strips into the sediments. Analysis of the deposited oxyhydroxides ca provide useful information on the chemistry of these metals in oxic and anoxic sediments. A number of plastic materials were investigated, but polycarbonate (Lexan) and Teflon were found to perform best. Teflon collected oxyhydroxides at the oxic-anoxic boundary. Sustained release of oxygen from Lexan resulted in deposits forming deep into the anoxic zone, as oxidati\u00f3n of soluble iron and manganese species occurred at the surface of the plastic. Over a period of some 12 weeks, the dissolved oxygen is gradually consumed until a deposit is seen only at the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17208388607447687753", "cites_id": ["17208388607447687753"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/264790872_In_situ_collectors_for_studying_metal_deposition_in_sediments/links/53f1a3430cf26b9b7dd0da69/In-situ-collectors-for-studying-metal-deposition-in-sediments.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SWLMt0N60O4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
