Using acid volatile sulfide (AVS) measurements, ZnS, PbS, and CdS phases were shown to be resistant to oxidation. The AVS in resuspended, highly anoxic, contaminated sediments was rapidly oxidized with <6% remaining after 24 h. This was inconsistent with their high particulate lead and zinc content, which should stabilize sulfide against oxidation, suggesting that a large proportion of these metals (73\u221295%) were nonsulfide phases. When zinc was added to the sediments in a soluble ionic form, ZnS was quantitatively formed; however, lead and zinc solid phases, equilibrated with the sediments for several months, exhibited varying degrees of sulfide formation (10\u221276%). The results were consistent with the rapid formation of metal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13180100966329558499", "cites_id": ["13180100966329558499"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es991440x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4yXbaf8f6bYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 9, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 4, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
