It provides a general chemical understanding of important metals and metalloids, their sources, behaviour, impacts and management. Metals, metalloids and non-metals all make up the periodic table (Appendix II) and are classified into these categories according to their properties. Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity and are malleable and ductile, making them very useful to humans and therefore economically valuable. Metalloids sit on the periodic table in a jagged line at the division between metals and non-metals and have intermediate properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:-DxkuPiZhfEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-10127-4_5", "cites_per_year": {}}
