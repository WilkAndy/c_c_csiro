To assess the suitability of these sediments for ocean disposal, a defensible sediment quality guideline value (SQGV) for dioxin\u2010like compounds, expressed as pg\u2009toxic equivalent (TEQ)fish/g dry weight, was required. There were deemed to be too many uncertainties associated with a value derived using effects data from field studies. A similar issue was associated with values based on equilibrium partitioning from sediment to pore water, largely associated with the wide range of reported sediment:water partition coefficients. Greater certainty was associated with the use of a tissue residue approach based on equilibrium partitioning between sediment and organisms determined using tissue concentrations in fish, the most sensitive aquatic biota, and biota \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.5499", "cites_per_year": {}}
