Fossil energy from these unconventional resources is the fastest growing component of new supplies of oil and gas. In addition to extensive use of these technologies in the United States, there are many new unconventional oil and gas resources that are being exploited in Asia, Europe, Australia and Africa. These developments have generated public concern over the potential for adverse social, environmental and human health impacts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/EN/fulltext/env12n3_fo", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HEJs9l2y2W8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
