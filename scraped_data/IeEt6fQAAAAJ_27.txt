Good features of this practice include: pore water is a key exposure route for some organisms associated with sediments; pore water testing eliminates particle size effects; pore water analyses and tests can provide useful information regarding contamination and pollution. Bad features include: pore water is not the only exposure route; pore water tests lack chemical or biological realism; their \u201csensitivity\u201d relative to other tests may be meaningless due to manipulation and laboratory artifacts; many sediment and surface dwelling organisms are not directly influenced by pore water. Bad features can become ugly if: other exposure pathways are not considered (for toxicity or bioaccumulation); manipulation techniques are not appropriate; pore water tests are inappropriately linked to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17025659172579467854", "cites_id": ["17025659172579467854"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X01002430", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TmJ4yM9KR-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 9, "2004": 3, "2005": 13, "2006": 5, "2007": 9, "2008": 3, "2009": 16, "2010": 16, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 13, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
