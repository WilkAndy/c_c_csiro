The Editors of Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management invited experts in the field to describe the primary issues associated with the control and release of radioactive materials to the environment, particularly those that are of importance to the health of the human populations and the ecological systems that populate our planet. This collection of invited short commentaries aims to inform on the safety of nuclear power plants damaged by natural disasters and provide a primer on the potential environmental impacts. The intent of these invited commentaries is not to fuel the excitement and fears about the Fukushima Daiichi incident; rather, it is to collect views and comments from some of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ieam.240", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b99SqfDzUksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
