In this study, the toxicity of nanoparticulate CeO2 (nominally 10\u201320 nm) to the freshwater algaPseudokirchneriella subcapitatawas compared to the same material at the micron size (nominally< 5\u00b5m). Growth inhibition experiments revealed inhibitory concentration values, giving 50% reduction in algal growth rate after 72 h (IC50), of 10.3\u00b11.7 and 66\u00b122 mg L\u2212 1 for the nanoparticles and bulk materials respectively. Cells exposed to CeO2 particles were permeable to the DNA-binding dye SYTOX\u00ae Green in a concentration-dependent manner indicating damage to the cell membrane. Screening assays to assess the oxidative activity of the particles showed that the light illumination conditions used during standard assays are sufficient to stimulate photocatalytic activity of CeO2 particles, causing the generation of hydroxyl radicals and peroxidation of a model plant fatty acid. No oxidative activity or lipid peroxidation was observed in the dark. These findings indicate that inhibitory mode of action of CeO2 to P. subcapitata is mediated by a cell-particle interaction causing membrane damage. The effect is most likely photochemically induced and is enhanced for the nanoparticulate form of the CeO2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/51031796/Physico-chemical_behaviour_and_algal_tox20161223-8716-16i6k1z.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:x78jnISp5SMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
