This will typically invoke a strong defence from those who feel their data are being challenged, and if these happen to be among those chosen to review the paper, the chances of the paper being recommended for publication are likely to be limited. The editor is not in a position to make such judgements and must clearly be guided by the referees\u2019 recommendations. There are often several ways to interpret experimental findings, and there is frequently a schism between researchers noted for a strong theoretical focus and those who are more strongly experimentalist.In this case, the paper by Raewyn Town and Herman van Leeuwen [1] challenged the past interpretations of adsorptive stripping voltammetric studies of iron complexation in seawater. Not surprisingly, this received a critical response from Stan van den Berg \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/248881855_Foreword_The_Case_of_Measuring_Marine_IronIII_Complexes/links/53ec41720cf202d087d010ba/Foreword-The-Case-of-Measuring-Marine-IronIII-Complexes.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Qxg_47l3BsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
