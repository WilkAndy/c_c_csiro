Even the most sophisticated instrument cannot compensate for incorrect environmental sampling and sampling program design, yet these practices are often neglected in favour of refining analytical methods to obtain good accuracy and precision. This can lead to outputs that~ re data rich and information poor. Bill Maher and Graham Batley write from the perspective of water sampling, but the approach applies equally to all environmental monitoring."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/pdf/10.3316/ielapa.200308195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VjJIvtbi9bUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
