The management of large volumes of ash dam water can be particularly difficult. ''Dry'' landfill sites may also release trace elements where groundwater or rainwater comes into contact with the ash residue. A number of these elements are toxic or accumulate in organisms to an extent that biological function is impaired. The biological activity of the leached elements is a function of factors such as speciation (including organic complexation), pH and water hardness. Simple limits of water release based on concentration alone are often used in the licensing of power stations but are an inadequate parameter with which to manage water quality. The Australian and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council Water Quality Guidelines provide broad holistic guidance on discharge limits as well as detailed advice on the monitoring and assessment of environmental impact.
