This study examines the distribution and degradation pathways for endosulfan in an aquatic system and the processes by which it is removed. In the alkaline waters of the cotton region, hydrolysis is the dominant degradation process. By this mechanism alone, the expected half-lives for the \u03b1- and \u03b2-endosulfan isomers were found to be 3\u00b76 days and 1\u00b77 days, respectively. Partitioning studies showed, however, that the major proportion of endosulfan would associate with the sediments (log Koc\u03b1 3\u00b76 and log Koc\u03b2 4\u00b73). Field studies confirmed the presence of high concentrations in sediments. Microcosm experiments showed that loss of endosulfan was slower than predicted from hydrolysis rates. Models are presented to explain how desorption from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 153, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=182071808289665537", "cites_id": ["182071808289665537"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/026974919390111Z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AfK3UFjZhgIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 3, "2007": 9, "2008": 11, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 5, "2012": 11, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
