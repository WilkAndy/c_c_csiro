To sample sediment pore waters without altering metal chemistry is extremely difficult, but can be successfully achieved by the use of in situ dialysis samplers, or peepers. To date the application of peepers to heavy metals has been restricted mainly to freshwater systems. The authors have thoroughly evaluated their use in estuarine sediments, including both laboratory and field studies of equilibration kinetics. Equilibration was shown to be more rapid in field deployments, while for long deployment times it was observed that erroneously high concentrations of iron and metals accumulated in those peeper chambers sampling sediment layers above the redox boundary for field but not laboratory sediments, most likely as a result of tidal influences. A second in situ sampling procedure involved the use of plastic collectors to study reactions of metals as a result of the introduction of oxygen at depth in anoxic sediment, as might result from irrigation by burrowing animals. The gradual diffusion of oxygen from polycarbonate strips immersed in the sediment induces oxidation of dissolved metals, with the notable precipitation of iron (III) oxyhydroxides and co-precipitation of solubilized heavy metals onto the collector which is removed and analyzed. Results will be presented for the application of these techniques to contaminated estuarine sediments in Australian field locations, to determine fluxes to overlying waters and to predict metal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/398248", "cites_per_year": {}}
