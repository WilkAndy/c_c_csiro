This is an important consideration because it is the bioavailability and bioreactivity of metals that control their potential to cause adverse effects. The BLM approach has gained widespread interest amongst the scientific, regulated and regulatory communities because of its potential for use in developing water quality criteria (WQC) and in performing aquatic risk assessments for metals. Specifically, the BLM does this in a way that considers the important influences of site-specific water quality. This journal issue includes papers that describe recent advances with regard to the development of the BLM approach. Here, the current status of the BLM development effort is described in the context of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 908, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6111008655818791884", "cites_id": ["6111008655818791884"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532045602001126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zJtqtf6pzlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 9, "2004": 42, "2005": 45, "2006": 38, "2007": 59, "2008": 52, "2009": 44, "2010": 47, "2011": 55, "2012": 51, "2013": 41, "2014": 61, "2015": 51, "2016": 50, "2017": 41, "2018": 50, "2019": 46, "2020": 37, "2021": 35, "2022": 32, "2023": 17}}
