This harbour is the most extensively copper-contaminated estuarine water body in Australia owing to current and historical inputs of metal-rich waters and sediments from the nearby Mount Lyell copper mine. The dissolved copper concentrations in the harbour water column were highly variable (4\u2013560\u03bcgl\u22121) and displayed a north to south gradient, decreasing with distance from the King River, which carries the inputs from the mine. The most significant process affecting dissolved copper concentrations was the neutralisation of acidic river waters with seawater and the resulting coprecipitation with iron oxyhydroxide flocs. Approximately 60% of the riverine dissolved copper input was removed from solution by this process.
