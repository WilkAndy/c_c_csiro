Proc.;(United States), 1984", "author": "GE Batley", "publisher": "CSIRO, Division of Energy Chemistry, Lucas Heights", "abstract": "The application of high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to the analysis of resin-separated fractions of oil shale retort waters and leachates is described. For compounds such as phenols and amines, having oxidizable functional groups, enhanced selectivity and sensitivity are achievable over conventional u.v. spectrophotometric detection. Phenol, 2-, 3and 4- cresol, dimethylphenols, resorcinol and 2and 5- methylresorcinol, were detected and quantified in the hydrophobic acid fractions; the procedures for their identification are outlined. In the basic fraction, the possibility of quantifying amines, aminopyridines and heterocyclic nitrogen bases was also investigated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6136798", "cites_per_year": {}}
