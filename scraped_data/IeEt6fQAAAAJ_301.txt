Cobalamin, the glucose tolerance factor, and heme iron, for example, are the favoured forms of cobalt, chro-mium, and iron, respectively. Elements may be classified as either essential, such as Cu, Zn, Cr, Mo, V, Mn, Sn, Fe, Ni, Co, and Se or non-essential, Ag, Cd, Hg, Tl, Pb and As. Excesses of either class can be toxic, although in general, the non-essential elements are of greater toxicity, and as with bioavailability, this toxicity will be a function of chemical form."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3144885957737616729&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
