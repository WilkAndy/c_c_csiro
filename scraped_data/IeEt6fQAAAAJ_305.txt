A novel approach to the preparation of uranium hexafluoride by a method not requiring the use of fluorine", "pub_year": 1973, "citation": "Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters 9 (11), 1157-1161, 1973", "author": "A Ekstrom and GE Batley", "journal": "Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters", "volume": "9", "number": "11", "pages": "1157-1161", "abstract": "The preparation of UF/sub 6/ by reaction between UF/sub 4/ and U/sub 2/ suffe rs from the disadvantage that the high temperature required to give an economical oxidation rate causes excessive corrosion and leads to sintering of the UF/sub 4/. It was found, however, that the reactions involved can be catalyzed by small quantities of Pt or other selected metal catalysts. The Pt catalyst used in the study described was a commercial material consisting of 5 wt% Pt on gamma -Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/. It was found that at 64O deg C, in the presence of 1 wt% of the catalyst, the reaction was 50% complete in 5 min., whereas in the absence of catalyst, at the same temperature the reaction was only 7% complete in the same time. A catalytic effect was noticeable at catalyst concentrations as low as 0.1 wt%. Ru, Rh and Ir also promoted the reaction, although not as effectively as Pt. The observed catalytic effect is unusual in that a sole catalyst enhances the rate of reaction between a gas and a solid, and it is thought that the results represent the first demonstration that this can occur for oxidation rcactions. The most plausible explanation would appear to be that the gaseous reactant is adsorbed on the catalyst surface and is subsequently desorbed either in the atomic form or some other activated form.
