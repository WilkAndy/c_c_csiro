From a study of bis (N-alkylsalicylaldiminato) zinc (II) complexes, for which structures have been established by crystallography, a set of criteria, based on infra-red and ultraviolet absorption spectra and the ability to form adducts with heterocyclic bases, have been established, which have enabled characterisation of the stereochemistry of the zinc as being either four-or five-coordinate in the solid state. These criteria when applied to the zinc complexes with quadridentate Schiff bases prepared from salicylaldehyde and polymethylenediamines, show the stereochemistry of zinc in these compounds to be determined solely by steric effects. When the ligand is such that four-coordination can produce a tetrahedral environment, further coordination does not occur; when fourcoordination cannot produce a t8trahedral environment, fivecoordination always occurs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/x43aidcb3zbzlkrlrgkfsptnum/access/wayback/https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/33aa34f9-aabf-4b9f-a196-346003eff339/content", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4yGrdx4W7Q8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
