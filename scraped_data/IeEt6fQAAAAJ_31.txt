For Pacific Ocean surface waters a mean value of 13.0\u00b11.4 ng Tl l\u22121 was found, while for freshwater samples the value was 3.7\u00b11.0 ng Tl l\u22121. Thermodynamic considerations of thallium speciation predict that both in seawater and freshwater thallium exists primarily in the trivalent state. This was confirmed by experiment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10882012773086702698", "cites_id": ["10882012773086702698"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072875802518", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aqwYNfasBJcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 4, "1985": 3, "1986": 3, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 10, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
