The previously proposed disproportionation mechanism has been examined theoretically to determine whether a wave with diffusion current corresponding to a four electron transfer and a plot of e versus log with a slope correspond ing to two electrons would be expected for a disproportion ation process. Theoretical predictions and experimental observations favoured the rejection of this mechanism and the acceptance of a consecutive reduction mechanism. This is proposed as a reversible two electron transfer with post-protonation or a combined pre-and post-protonation leading to an intermediate hydrazo species. This is then reduced in a second combined two proton and two electron addition with the formation of two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/saoprdnumvholiicfnkltu3lb4/access/wayback/https://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/server/api/core/bitstreams/49dab1a1-f9d8-4d5f-b006-1d284d2fc005/content", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:107HNRUu-_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
