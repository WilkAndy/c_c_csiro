The market value of GNMs is predicted to reach $ US 1.3 billion by 2023. Common to many nanomaterials (NMs), an important and unresolved question is the environmental consequences of the increases in GNM use. The current deficiencies in studies reporting ecotoxicology data for GNMs include, differences in analytical methodologies for quantification, no standardized test guidelines, differences in morphology of GNMs, the lack of Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers and the quality of the reported data. The assessment of potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms typically relies on guideline values (GVs) based on species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) of toxicity data. Herein, we present preliminary water quality GVs for graphene oxide (GO) NMs in freshwaters. Data include 10 species from 7 phyla (bacteria and fungi were not included). The most sensitive organism was found to be the freshwater shrimp (Palaemon pandaliformis). The derived GVs for 99%, 95%, 90% and 80% species protection were 350, 600, 830 and 1,300 \u00b5g/L, respectively. Results of this study will contribute to the regulatory derivations of future water quality GVs for GNMs. This article is protected by copyright.
