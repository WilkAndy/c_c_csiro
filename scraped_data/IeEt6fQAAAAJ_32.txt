The essential \u201cCertainty Elements\u201d are addressed in a transparent best professional judgment (BPJ) process with multiple lines-of-evidence (LOE) ultimately quantitatively integrated (but not necessarily combined into a single value). The WOE Certainty Elements include: (1) Development of a conceptual model (showing linkages of critical receptors and ecosystem quality characteristics); (2) Explanation of linkages between measurement endpoint responses (direct and indirect with associated spatial/temporal dynamics) and conceptual model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 134, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2039196370544357646", "cites_id": ["2039196370544357646"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20028091056854", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DvGPfUuuTBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 10, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 3, "2007": 10, "2008": 7, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 10, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 4}}
