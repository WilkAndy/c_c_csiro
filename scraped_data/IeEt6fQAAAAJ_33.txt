The concentration of each species is calculated from measurements using anodic stripping voltammetry of labile and total metal in samples which were (a) untreated, (b) u.v. irradiated, (c) passed through a chelating resin column, and (d) u.v. irradiated then passed through a chelating resin column. The scheme was applied to the analysis of Cd, Pb and Cu in seawater."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9584850932022331284", "cites_id": ["9584850932022331284"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00032717608067817", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lEdD1CM7BIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 9, "1981": 8, "1982": 6, "1983": 10, "1984": 6, "1985": 5, "1986": 8, "1987": 5, "1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 4, "1991": 5, "1992": 5, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 5, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 4}}
