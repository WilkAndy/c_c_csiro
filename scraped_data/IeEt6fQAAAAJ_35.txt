For a 10\u2010d exposure to Cu\u2010spiked sediments, toxicity to the amphipod Melita plumulosa was demonstrated to occur through a combination of dissolved and dietary Cu exposure pathways, but for the bivalves Spisula trigonella and Tellina deltoidalis, toxicity occurred primarily by exposure to dissolved Cu. For relatively oxidized sediments that had moderate amounts of organic carbon (2.6\u20138.3% OC), silt (20\u2013100% <63\u2010\u00b5m particles) but low acid\u2010volatile sulfide (AVS), acute toxicity thresholds for the three species were derived based on the OC\u2010normalized Cu concentration of the less than 63\u2010\u00b5m sediment fraction. For all three species, no effects were observed at concentrations below 10\u2009\u00b5g/L dissolved Cu (in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=398848059556671602", "cites_id": ["398848059556671602"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.531", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:crA6bTL-iAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 15, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 16, "2023": 9}}
