The observed metal distributions were found to be consistent with the other measured physical and chemical properties of the sampled waters. In all samples, the percentages of metals associated with colloidal matter were high, amounting to 40\u201360% of total copper, 45\u201370% of total lead and 15\u201335% of total cadmium. The scheme was used to follow changes in metal speciation under different sample storage conditions. Storage at 4 \u00b0C in polythene containers was shown to prevent losses or changes in speciation of the metals studied."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6550930062015560261", "cites_id": ["6550930062015560261"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0302352478900579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RXrd3i6U6VoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 8, "1985": 5, "1986": 8, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 5, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 5, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
