However, retention of the metals naturally present in seawater was considerably less (Table 1, Figure 1). The hydrogen form of Chelex-100 is gradually neutralised by the bicarbonate and metals present in seawater, and a plot of pH VS. volume of effluent has the shape of a typical acid-base titration curve (Figure l), with the pH of the effluent finally rising to 7.4 after 4 fi of seawater. AS expected 4, 7, 8, the retention of trace metals from seawater increased with increasing PH. with the exception of copper, bound metals'(ie total-1abile) are very poorly extracted by the chelating resin, even at a high PH. Labile zinc and copper are almost quantitatively retained after the passage of 1 a of sample, but labile lead and cadmium are not completely removed.
