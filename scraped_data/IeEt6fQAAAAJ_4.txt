Concerns about the environmental fate and effects of these materials have stimulated studies to predict environmental concentrations in air, water, and soils and to determine threshold concentrations for their ecotoxicological effects on aquatic or terrestrial biota.Nanoparticles can be added to soils directly in fertilizers orplant  protection products or indirectly through application to land or wastewater treatment products such as sludges or biosolids. Nanoparticles may enter aquatic systems directly through industrial discharges or from disposal of wastewater treatment effluents or indirectly through surface runoff from soils.
