Experiments with model Fe(II)\u2010rich pore waters demonstrated the rates at which adsorptive losses of Cd, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb, and Zn occur upon exposure to air. Experiments with Zn\u2010contaminated estuarine sediments demonstrated large and often unpredictable changes to metal partitioning during sediment storage, removal of organisms, and homogenization before testing. Small modifications to conditions, such as aeration of overlying waters, caused large changes to the metal partitioning. Disturbances caused by sediment collection required many weeks for reestablishment of equilibrium. Bioturbation by benthic organisms led to oxidation of pore\u2010water Fe(II) and lower Zn fluxes because of the formation of Fe hydroxide precipitates that adsorb pore\u2010water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3404833284675461386", "cites_id": ["3404833284675461386"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.5620220225", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CuGBNNVlQC8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 11, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 1, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
