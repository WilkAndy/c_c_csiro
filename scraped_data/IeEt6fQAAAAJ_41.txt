Ultra-violet irradiation of acidified water with a 550-W mercury vapour lamp releases bound zinc, cadmium, lead and copper after 4 h. The same results can be achieved with a 30-Mrad dose of high-energy \u03b3-irradiation. These techniques are also effective for the release of metals in whole blood and blood plasma, where sample volumes as small as 200 \u03bcl are adequate in analyses for zinc, copper and lead. By comparison with acid digestion and solvent extraction methods, irradiation treatments offer the advantages of minimum sample manipulation and negligible reagent blanks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=697509458638831991", "cites_id": ["697509458638831991"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267001835698", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d4GkNSgNrgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 8, "1983": 7, "1984": 3, "1985": 5, "1986": 6, "1987": 2, "1988": 5, "1989": 6, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 4, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 6}}
