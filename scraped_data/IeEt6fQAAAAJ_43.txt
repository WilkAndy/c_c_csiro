After plating, the furnace Is transferred to an atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer for atomization of the deposited metals. The flow assembly has been tested for the analysisof lead In seawater, comparing results with those obtained by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). The technique Is applied to the determination In seawater of both labile and total cobalt and nickel. These metals are Irreversibly deposited on graphite and have poor sensitivity using ASV but are readily measured by AA. Measurements are reproducible with a relative standard deviation of 15%. For 15-and 10-mlnute depositions, re-spectively, Co and Nl characteristic concentrations are 0.02 pg per liter.Although a considerable effort has been devotedto studies of a wide range of spectral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14502023811038674141", "cites_id": ["14502023811038674141"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac50021a035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3Xw3NdKJQckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 6, "1983": 4, "1984": 5, "1985": 3, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 5, "1991": 2, "1992": 4, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
