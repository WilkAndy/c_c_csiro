Zinc fluxes from the sediments were high, ranging from 10 to 89 mg of Zn m-2 day-1. In the absence of capping, experiments in corer\u2212reactors showed that simulated tidal processes increased zinc fluxes 5-fold. Fluxes were also greater in the presence of sediment-dwelling organisms. If organisms were removed, and recolonizing organisms later added, their bioturbation activities initially lowered zinc fluxes, but fluxes gradually reached steady state at the higher levels seen previously. Capping materials physically isolate contaminated sediments, provide a binding substrate for metals released from the sediment, and importantly create an anoxic environment below the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3694752996960995785", "cites_id": ["3694752996960995785"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es025632v", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yYmrbEZmRjMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
