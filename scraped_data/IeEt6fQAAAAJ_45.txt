Maximum toxicity occurred at pH 5.8 to 6.2, where as little as 5 \u03bcgL\u20101 of labile aluminium significantly inhibited algal growth. Algal assay and computer modelling results implicate Al(OH)2 + as the aluminium species most toxic to algae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9959646756239265287", "cites_id": ["9959646756239265287"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593338309384184", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B04D0vTFN4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 3, "1986": 4, "1987": 4, "1988": 6, "1989": 4, "1990": 8, "1991": 6, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 6, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 7}}
