A water sample (pH 6\u20138.2) was pumped through a small plug of the Ca-form of Chelex 100 at a flow rate of 48\u00b14mL/min. The flow regime was optimised to give the shortest possible contact time (0.25s) but at the same time ensured quantitative uptake of inorganic metal standards onto the resin. Labile metal was calculated as the difference between influent and effluent metal concentrations, measured by some form of atomic spectrometry. In tests with six metal-spiked natural freshwater samples (10\u03bcg/L added metal, pH 7.0\u20138.2), the labile fraction measured ranged from 87 to 98%, 32 to 64%, 12 to 78%, 38 to 91% and 63 to 89% for cadmium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc, respectively. Application of the method to copper-contaminated waters showed that the results provided a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14832272282601900241", "cites_id": ["14832272282601900241"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267005018477", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0chbaA7R1s0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 9, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
