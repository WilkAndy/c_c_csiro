Radiotracer techniques were used to determine the rates of accumulation (at 21\u00b13 C) of cadmium and copper by these organisms from water, algae and sediment sources. A biokinetic model was then developed to separately quantify influx and efflux rates from the metal sources. For exposures to seawater, metal uptake (lg-1 d-1) and efflux rates (% d-1) were 0.028 and 6.0 (Cd) and 0.12 and 16 (Cu) for M. plumulosa and 0.012 and 8.5 (Cd) and 0.19 and 11 (Cu) for T. deltoidalis. Net accumulation of metals from the dissolved phase was greater for Cu than Cd for both organisms. For sediment exposures, metal assimilation efficiencies (AEs,%) and efflux rates (% d-1) were 22\u00b110 and 19\u00b13 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=577582448206977410", "cites_id": ["577582448206977410"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v287/p177-188/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gpngLS38AwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
