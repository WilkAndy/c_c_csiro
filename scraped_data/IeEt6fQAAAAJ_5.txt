The next decade will certainly see a blossoming of interest from chemists, biochemists, and biologists in techniques for chemical speciation. This is because it is becoming more and more apparent that both bioavailability and toxicity are critically dependent on the chemical form of the substance under test. Measurement of the total concentration of a nutrient or a trace element provides very little information about the bioavailability of the substance, since many vitamins and essential elements are now known to exist in a variety of chemical forms, the assimilability of which vary greatly.1\u20133 For example, niacin and folic acid exist in some foods in bound forms which are unavailable to many \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 614, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15347011410381698218", "cites_id": ["15347011410381698218"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408348008542721", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qvSq15CJ-9QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 21, "1985": 18, "1986": 34, "1987": 20, "1988": 21, "1989": 22, "1990": 15, "1991": 16, "1992": 17, "1993": 18, "1994": 18, "1995": 24, "1996": 17, "1997": 11, "1998": 10, "1999": 7, "2000": 11, "2001": 17, "2002": 17, "2003": 15, "2004": 16, "2005": 14, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 7, "2012": 17, "2013": 18, "2014": 10, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 12, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
