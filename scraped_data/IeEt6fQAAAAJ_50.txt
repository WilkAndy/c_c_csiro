Currently there is no such guideline available for aluminium in marine waters. A water quality guideline of 24\u2009\u00b5g total Al/L has been developed for aluminium in marine waters based on chronic 10% inhibition or effect concentrations (IC10 or EC10) and no\u2010observed\u2010effect concentrations (NOECs) from 11 species (2 literature values and 9 species tested including temperate and tropical species) representing 6 taxonomic groups. The 3 most sensitive species tested were a diatom Ceratoneis closterium (formerly Nitzschia closterium; IC10\u2009=\u200918\u2009\u00b5g Al/L, 72\u2010h growth rate inhibition) < mussel Mytilus edulis plannulatus (EC10\u2009=\u2009250\u2009\u00b5g Al/L, 72\u2010h embryo development) < oyster Saccostrea echinata (EC10\u2009=\u2009410\u2009\u00b5g Al/L, 48\u2010h \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=232492550607519705", "cites_id": ["232492550607519705"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.2771", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2b_iM776OQMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 11, "2017": 4, "2018": 15, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 8}}
