Recent papers have described the direct determination of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper using both the hanging mercury drop (HMDE)[1--4] and thin film (TFE)[5, 6] electrodes in seawater solutions ranging in pH from strongly acid to the natural pH (pH 8.1). In studying the chemical speciation of trace metals in seawater, care must be taken in the selection of solution conditions for asv Obviously the likelihood of dissociation of certain'bound'metal species will be enhanced in strongly acid solutions, while the sensitivity of the asv, method for zinc, lead and copper has been shown to decrease at high pH [7]. Seawater buffered to pH 4--5 with an acetate buffer would therefore appear to be a convenient medium in which to measure labile metal concentrations.
