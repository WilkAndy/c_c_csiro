Activation energies measured for the catalyzed reactions have a common value of 23 \u00b1 2 kcal mole\u22121 which is equal to the activation energy for the desorption of hydrogen atoms from a platinum surface. The reduction mechanism involves transfer of hydrogen atoms both by surface and gas diffusion. Gas diffusion is significant only at temperatures above 350 \u00b0C."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6414990646215285742", "cites_id": ["6414990646215285742"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021951774900505", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7psdMQGgBlkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 5, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 7, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
