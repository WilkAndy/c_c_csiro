We identified the problems associated with SQG development and made a series of recommendations to ensure that the methods being applied were scientifically defensible and internationally applicable. This document summarizes the key findings from the expert group. To enable evaluation of current SQG derivation and application systems, a feedback mechanism is required to communicate confounding factors and effects in differing environments, while field validation is necessary to gauge the effectiveness of SQG \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3462979171587865614", "cites_id": ["3462979171587865614"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-013-1778-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DjwSezX5DjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 9, "2016": 0, "2017": 11, "2018": 3, "2019": 16, "2020": 10, "2021": 15, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
