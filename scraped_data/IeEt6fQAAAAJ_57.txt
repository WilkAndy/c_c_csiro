Background TBT levels of below 2 ng Sn g-1 contrasted with values between 80 and 130 ng Sn g-1 in oysters exposed to high boat densities or poor tidal flushing. Shell deformities and reduced tissue weights were associated with all samples displaying elevated TBT levels. Specimens of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, growing on the same racks displayed 2-3 times the TBT concentrations of S. commercialis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=87496351285725423", "cites_id": ["87496351285725423"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf9890049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:70iHyXfZNgEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 8, "1992": 5, "1993": 6, "1994": 0, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 6, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 3}}
