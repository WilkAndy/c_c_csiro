We discuss novel insights into fate and behavior, metrology, transformations, bioavailability, toxicity mechanisms, and environmental impacts, with a focus on terrestrial and aquatic systems. Overall, the findings were that: 1) despite substantial developments, critical gaps remain, in large part due to the lack of analytical, modeling, and field capabilities, and also due to the breadth and complexity of the area; 2) a key knowledge gap is the lack of data on environmental concentrations and dosimetry generally; 3) substantial evidence shows that there are nanospecific effects (different from the effects of both ions and larger particles) on the environment in terms of fate, bioavailability, and toxicity, but this is not consistent for all NMs, species, and relevant processes; 4) a paradigm is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 439, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1085983806606728111", "cites_id": ["1085983806606728111"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4147", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r9uesIQwEg8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 50, "2020": 108, "2021": 124, "2022": 103, "2023": 44}}
