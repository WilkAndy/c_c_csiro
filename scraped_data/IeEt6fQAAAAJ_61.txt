Apte and J.L Stauber", "journal": "Australian Journal of Ecotoxicology", "volume": "7", "pages": "109-122", "abstract": "Guidelines for metals in aquatic ecosystems are typically based on total concentrations. However, it is well established that metal bioavailability (ie. the ability of a metal to bind or traverse the cell membrane) is critically dependent on the physicochemical form, or speciation, of a metal. As such, guidelines based on total concentrations may be overprotective, since only a fraction of the total concentration may be bioavailable. Following a risk-based approach, a decision tree was developed to account for metal speciation and bioavailability in aquatic ecosystems. The decision tree includes three increasingly complex levels of analysis:(i) total acid-soluble (unfiltered) metal concentration;(ii) dissolved (filtered) acid-soluble metal concentration, and (iii) the concentration of specific metal species (eg. geochemical modelling) or groups of metal species (eg. chemical measurement) and/or biological testing. The complexity of analysis for a water sample depends on guideline conformity at each level of the decision tree. As part of this approach, algorithms for hardness-dependency were derived for Cd, Cr (III), Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn in freshwaters (\u2264 2.5\u2030 salinity), because of its established effect on the bioavailability of these metals. The measurement of metal speciation and bioavailability permits guidelines for protecting aquatic ecosystems to be potentially relaxed on a site-specific basis. This signifies a move to develop chemical indicators further so that they better reflect biological effects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5904307644630905876", "cites_id": ["5904307644630905876"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50440997/INCORPORATING_METAL_SPECIATION_AND_BIOAV20161120-19672-7mx6hx.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FDTZOoVQ8FEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
