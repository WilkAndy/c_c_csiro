Using species sensitivity distributions, a new trigger value of 460\u03bcg total NH3\u2013N/L was derived for slightly to moderately disturbed systems (95% protection concentration, PC95), with a value of 160\u03bcg total NH3\u2013N/L applying to waters of high conservation value (PC99). For sediment pore waters, a guideline trigger value of 3.9mg total NH3\u2013N/L, derived from the 80th percentile of background data from Sydney Harbour, is recommended. This value is likely to be exceeded in degraded sediments subject to dredging; however, ocean disposal of such sediments results in rapid decreases in porewater ammonia and a guideline trigger value for dissolved ammonia during disposal of dredged sediments of 1550\u03bcg total NH3\u2013N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17102095307262463582", "cites_id": ["17102095307262463582"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X09002306", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xg5BOBLZVu0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
