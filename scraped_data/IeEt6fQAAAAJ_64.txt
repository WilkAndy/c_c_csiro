A workshop held at CSIRO Land and Water at Lucas Heights, NSW in April 2010 identified a range of tasks relating to methods for the derivation of guideline values (GVs) for toxicants (termed trigger values [TVs] in the 2000 Guidelines). A contract to undertake these revision tasks was issued by the Council of Australian Government\u2019s Standing Council on Environment and Water (SCEW) in February 2013. This report was prepared by CSIRO in consultation with selected expert members from the Working Group. It provides the technical rationale for key changes to the derivation method. It supplements another report (Warne et al 2014) that provides the full revised methodology for deriving toxicant GVs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5241469549392415392", "cites_id": ["5241469549392415392"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Graeme-Batley/publication/286418927_Technical_Rationale_for_Changes_to_the_Method_for_Deriving_Australian_and_New_Zealand_Water_Quality_Guideline_Values_for_Toxicants/links/5668aee108ae9da364b9f77d/Technical-Rationale-for-Changes-to-the-Method-for-Deriving-Australian-and-New-Zealand-Water-Quality-Guideline-Values-for-Toxicants.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oMqP4MhwvUgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
