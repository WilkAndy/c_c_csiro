Using species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) of copper effects data, new guidelines were derived for copper in non-sulfidic marine sediments in which organic carbon (OC) and particle size strongly influence copper bioavailability. The derived SQGs varied in a predictable manner with changes in sediment particle size and organic carbon (OC), and were shown to offer a significant improvement on the existing \u2018single value\u2019 SQG. Adequate protection for all benthic organisms is expected to be achieved for a OC-normalised copper concentration of 3.5mgCug\u22121 OC in the <63\u03bcm sediment fraction. For short-term exposures, the equivalent acute guideline is 11mg<63\u03bcmCug\u22121 OC. The new SQGs incorporate a high degree of conservatism owing to the use of copper-spiked \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=842906349003859578", "cites_id": ["842906349003859578"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653511010113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:euZLx9uasgsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
