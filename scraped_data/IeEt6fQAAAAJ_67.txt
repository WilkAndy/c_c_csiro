Optimal analytical conditions were found to be an XO concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, a pH of 5, and an adsorption potential at \u22121.2 V vs. Ag AgCl  with stripping from \u22120.2 V. The limit of detection for a 180 s stirred adsorption time is 6 ng I\u22121, making the method amenable to the determination of lead in open ocean waters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16901693748974205111", "cites_id": ["16901693748974205111"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003267095000555", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tzgMaurgjuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
