Data for extractable zinc, lead and cadmium in a range of sediments has been compared with the metals accumulated by three marine invertebrates, two deposit feeders, the gastropod Velacumantis australis, the club-shell Pyrazus ebeninus and a burrower, the polychaete worm Phyllodoce novaehollandiae. Both extractants were able to predict uptake of zinc, lead and cadmium by V. australis, and lead by P. novaehollandiae from sediments of similar chemical and physical characteristics. Using a range of field sediments, only lead bioavailability to P. ebeninus could be predicted by HCl and EDTA. The differing organic content of these sediments is a possible factor in limiting the ability of these extractants to estimate bioavailable metals in this case."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5683044226063891702", "cites_id": ["5683044226063891702"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969792903834", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9nxfEZ063k4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
