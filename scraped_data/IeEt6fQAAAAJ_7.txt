Preliminary experiments investigated the oxidation rates of model metal sulfide phases to provide mechanistic information for interpreting the observations on the natural sediment. FeS and MnS model phases were particularly labile and oxidized rapidly in aerated waters. In contrast, CdS, CuS, PbS, and ZnS model phases were kinetically stable over periods of several hours. The oxidation rate of free sulfide (HS-) was significantly slower than that of FeS and MnS. Upon sediment resuspension, the rapid decrease in acid volatile sulfide (AVS) could be accounted for by the oxidation of iron monosulfide phases. Over prolonged resuspension periods (>300 min), AVS decreased to values lower than the simultaneously extracted metals [SEM = \u2211Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn (1 M HCl \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 397, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15594698200772668799", "cites_id": ["15594698200772668799"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es970568g", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:f216rGN_a9gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 7, "2000": 14, "2001": 12, "2002": 16, "2003": 13, "2004": 21, "2005": 19, "2006": 17, "2007": 20, "2008": 23, "2009": 19, "2010": 12, "2011": 19, "2012": 30, "2013": 18, "2014": 15, "2015": 19, "2016": 23, "2017": 20, "2018": 14, "2019": 8, "2020": 13, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
