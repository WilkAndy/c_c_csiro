It is a more conservative measure than toxicity testing with sensitive biota, but a better indicator of toxicity than a dissolved copper measurement. Abstract.Twelve natural fresh waters with similar pH and hardness, but varying dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and copper concentrations, were assessed for (a) toxicity to an alga (Chlorella sp. 12), a cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia cf. dubia) and a bacterium (Erwinnia sp.), and (b) copper speciation using a rapid Chelex extraction method, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). In synthetic fresh water with no added DOC, at pH 7.0 and low hardness, the toxic responses (EC/IC50) of all three organisms to copper were similar. However, in the toxicity of copper added to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15545436192604257980", "cites_id": ["15545436192604257980"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN05048", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vH6tmtp7vNcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
