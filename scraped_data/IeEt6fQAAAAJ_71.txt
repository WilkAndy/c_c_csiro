Therefore, the use of a generic hardness-correction algorithm, developed as part of national water quality guidelines for protecting freshwater biota, is not recommended for assessing the toxicity of copper to these, and other, sensitive freshwater species. Use of the algorithm for these sensitive species will be underprotective because the calculated concentrations of copper in water that cause a toxic effect will be higher."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17195212093653351591", "cites_id": ["17195212093653351591"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653504012111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p3y1h0uqoe4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 10, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
