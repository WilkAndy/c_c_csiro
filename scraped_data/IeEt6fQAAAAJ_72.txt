However, there are problems associated with the measurement and interpretation of EH values. The measurement difficulties can be partly addressed by ensuring that suitable indicator electrodes are properly cleaned and tested before use. We compared the performance of platinum and glassy carbon indicator electrodes, and concluded that the former are preferred for application to natural waters and sediment. However, glassy carbon electrodes may be more suitable for measuring redox potentials involving organic species. The most effective way to clean platinum electrodes was to use abrasive polishing routinely and concentrated nitric acid to overcome long term fouling. A 1:100 dilution of ZoBell's solution (while maintaining the original electrolyte strength) was found to be a sensitive test \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=246508346335315488", "cites_id": ["246508346335315488"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267098001718", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IEZ88QjGawMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
