Optimum determination of arsenic in this medium was accomplished with an electrolysis potential of \u2212600mV vs Ag/AgCl (1M HCl) and application of a small constant reducing current (\u22121.5\u03bcA) during the stripping step. As little as 2\u03bcg/l of arsenic can be detected by this method in the presence of 5mg/l copper (II) ions with an electrolysis time of 30s. A linear concentration range of 10\u2013200\u03bcg/l was achieved under these conditions. Effective reduction of As(V) to As(III) in water, bovine liver and dogfish muscle samples was accomplished with l-cysteine prior to the CSP determination of arsenic."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18117885025751260174", "cites_id": ["18117885025751260174"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267098007004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DtxFMXCob_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
