Mean concentrations of cadmium (2.4 ng L-1), copper (31 ng L-1), nickel (180 ng L-1), lead (9 ng L-1) and zinc (<22 ng L-1) are among the lowest reported in the Southern Hemisphere and are consistent with recent oceanographic data for the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean. Waters from the southernmost sampling locality (Eden) contained higher phosphate, silicate, cadmium and nickel, but lower chromium concentrations than waters from the other four localities, reflecting the inputs of water from the Tasman Sea in the south compared with the dominance of waters from the Coral Sea along the rest of the coast. Cadmium concentrations were positively correlated with both phosphate and silicate. Chromium and lead concentrations were also significantly correlated.
