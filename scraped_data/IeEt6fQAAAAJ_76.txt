An assessment with respect to ecosystem health requires an ecological risk assessment that must take into account current knowledge about nanomaterial uses, environmental concentrations, fate, and effects, to determine both predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15704356145232809861", "cites_id": ["15704356145232809861"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdul-Razak-Mohamed-Sikkander/post/Dissolving_iron-nickel_silver-tin_and_copper-zinc_nanopowders/attachment/59d61d9579197b8077977f92/AS%3A271736170319872%401441798359404/download/manufactured-nanomaterials.doc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hQ_TdrUU8dkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
