In environmental monitoring programs, especially those studying metal contaminants at trace and ultratrace concentrations in natural waters, the sampling, sample storage and sample preparation stages prior to analysis, represent potentially greater sources of error than the chemical analysis. The improvements in data reliability and detection limits when appropriate QA is employed, allow meaningful relationships between the measured concentrations and other physical and chemical parameters to be more reliably interpreted. Published data generated from both field and laboratory studies, frequently show no evidence of QA, yet such data are being used to formulate quality guidelines and as the basis for expensive management actions. So that only quality data forms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12503092426420683851", "cites_id": ["12503092426420683851"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X99000168", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S4SuTlHog60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 9, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
