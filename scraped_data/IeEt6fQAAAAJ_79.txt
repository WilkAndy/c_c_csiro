Sediments at depths about 1 m below the water-sediment interface ranged in age from Modern to 786 calendar years bp on the basis of radiocarbon dating ofNotospisula trigonella valves. Multiple marker (for example ash-trace metals) depth-concentration sediment profiles yielded estimates of sedimentation rate ranging from 3 to 5 mm yr\u22121 at Griffins Bay to more than 16 mm yr\u22121 at Macquarie Rivulet. Sedimentation rates of approximately 10 mm yr\u22121 appeared to be typical of the western and southwestern portions of the lagoon. Rates of sediment accretion, prior to catchment clearing, urbanization, and industrialization have been estimated at less than 1 mm yr\u22121, thus indicating a general tenfold increase in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3912587363751748749,3441859808770205955", "cites_id": ["3912587363751748749", "3441859808770205955"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00768326", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jeQaQXpNTDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
