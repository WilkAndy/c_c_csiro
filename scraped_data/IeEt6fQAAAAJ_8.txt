Particular emphasis is given to environmental samples where the greatest concern for the effects of speciation on trace element transport, toxicity, and bioavailability have been ex-pressed. Special chapters are also devoted to methods of sam-pling and storage, and to the mathematical modeling of chemical speciation. Although designed for the practical analytical chemist, this publication is essential reading for researchers in or entering the field of chemical speciation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 382, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1784383544831966558", "cites_id": ["1784383544831966558"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=bsTafmtzZdMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA2&dq=info:Xv3CRGFnwxgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=D99iZm8yxy&sig=gQGFcLQnJlW181TJBRLDXDCMU1w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xv3CRGFnwxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 4, "1991": 4, "1992": 5, "1993": 11, "1994": 12, "1995": 19, "1996": 11, "1997": 20, "1998": 15, "1999": 15, "2000": 23, "2001": 16, "2002": 17, "2003": 18, "2004": 15, "2005": 18, "2006": 17, "2007": 12, "2008": 9, "2009": 8, "2010": 10, "2011": 5, "2012": 10, "2013": 2, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
