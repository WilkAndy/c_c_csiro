Using complementary environmental and biotic datasets, we examined five scenarios with respect to: dataset complexity; metal extraction; normalisation of organics; the inclusion/exclusion of acid-volatile sulfide data, and iron and manganese concentrations. Spatial distributions of abiotic variables were examined by principal components analysis, with canonical correspondence analysis used to examine the total and partitioning of biological variation. Metals were the dominant contaminant and explained the largest proportion of variation in the macrobenthic data. Extraction procedure and carbon normalisation of organics had little influence on the overall analysis. Porewater metal data was essential for interpretation, with excess of acid-volatile sulfide over simultaneously \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12913561678031494850", "cites_id": ["12913561678031494850"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF09263", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wh4qXO0vNrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
