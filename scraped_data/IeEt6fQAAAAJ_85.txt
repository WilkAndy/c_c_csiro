Despite a significant body of published research and critical reviews over the past 20\u2009yr aimed at improving the methodology, the fundamentals remain unchanged. Although there have been some recent suggestions for improvements to SSD methods in the literature, in general, few of these suggestions have been formally adopted. Furthermore, critics of the approach can rightly point to the fact that differences in technical implementation can lead to marked differences in results, thereby undermining confidence in SSD approaches. Despite the limitations, SSDs remain a practical tool and, until a demonstrably better inferential framework is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6337372078091431279", "cites_id": ["6337372078091431279"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.4925", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b20eBFTe8lcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 23, "2023": 20}}
