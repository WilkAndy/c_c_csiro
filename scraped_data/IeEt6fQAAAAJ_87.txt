Sedimentation appeared to be largely responsible for metal removal, with strong correlations between particulate metals and iron in input waters sampled over a storm event. Storm events contributed between 9 (Zn) and 21 (Cr) times the metal loads that enter the bay during low flow conditions. Although metal accumulations in sediments are below guideline concentrations in the major deposition zones, they are highest close to input sources. A unique feature of bay waters was the high concentration of dissolved arsenic (2.8 \u00b5g L\u20131). The source appears to be natural sediment mineralogy, and sediment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17646065492711454849", "cites_id": ["17646065492711454849"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf98032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gThYoBJr4_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
