There is an increasing public awareness and concern for the health of our waterways, and an expectation that water quality will be improved, but any improvement in water quality must address sediments as an important component of aquatic ecosystems, and a source of contaminants to the benthic food chain.The sediments of many of the estuaries in New South Wales (NSW) have high metal loads, derived largely from past industrial discharges and urban drainage. In many instances there are also elevated concentrations of organic contaminants, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides.
