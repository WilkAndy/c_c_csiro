Cerium sulfate, if formed during combustion, was below detection limits. Ceria nanoparticles were agglomerated within the soot matrix, with a mean aerodynamic diameter near 100\u2009nm. The dissolution of cerium from the dried ceria catalyst in synthetic soft water was extremely small (<0.0006% or <0.2\u2009\u00b5g Ce/L), with particles being highly agglomerated (<450\u2009nm). Agglomeration was reduced in the presence of humic acid. In the combusted samples, soot was dominant, and the solubility of cerium in soft water showed an almost 100\u2010fold increase in the <1\u2009nm fraction compared to that before combustion. It appeared that the nano\u2010CeO2 remained agglomerated within the soot \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9457428403467895359", "cites_id": ["9457428403467895359"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.2246", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P8JkfQaJP4MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 6}}
