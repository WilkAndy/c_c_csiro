Samplers have been developed that can concentrate extremely low levels of hydrophobic compounds, such as organochlorine pesticides, from water bodies, for direct analysis with minimal sample preparation. The passive samplers consist of polyethylene tubes filled with iso-octane that are deployed within weighted wire cages in estuaries and rivers for a period of three weeks. Hydrophobic compounds such as chlorinated pesticides are continuously partitioned from the water column into the solvent within the tube, providing an integrated sample over the duration of exposure. Pesticides are concentrated 200\u2013300 fold in three weeks. Upon retrieval, the contents can be analysed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7306947043308404857", "cites_id": ["7306947043308404857"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09542299.1995.11083249", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eQD9PJ99Z2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
