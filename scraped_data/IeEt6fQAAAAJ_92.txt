Cobalamin, the glucose tolerance factor, and heme iron, for example, are the favoured forms of cobalt, chromium, and iron, respectively. Elements may be classified as either essential, such as Cu, Zn, Cr, Mo, V, Mn, Sn, Fe, Ni, Co, and Se or non-essential, Ag, Cd, Hg, Tl, Pb and As. Excesses of either class can be toxic, although in general, the non-essential elements are of greater toxicity, and as with bioavailability, this toxicity will be a function of chemical form."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=416501453210893101", "cites_id": ["416501453210893101"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8234-8_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LbsRb921xwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 2, "1986": 6, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 1}}
