Monoolefins are found to hydrogenate rapidly only when the double bond is terminal. Hydrogenation of hexadiene and pentadiene isomers has shown that reduction does not necessarily stop at the monoene stage as previously believed. Dienes have the greatest reactivity when both double bonds are terminal and, in these cases, small percentages of saturate are formed. In these molecules it was found that conjugation is not a necessary prior step to hydrogenation, and short-chain conjugateddiene isomers were found to inhibit further reaction. In contrast, long-chain conjugated dienes are reduced since the larger size of the diene prevents the formation of stable catalyst-diene complexes. Unsaturatednitriles are hydrogenated when the double bond is terminal andnot hindered by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14003782905112788299", "cites_id": ["14003782905112788299"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja01024a020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S33vYltuV8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
