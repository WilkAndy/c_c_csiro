The method involves the detection of \u03b2-d-galactosidase, an enzyme marker of coliform bacteria. A fluorogenic substrate (methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-d-galactoside) is added to a buffered seawater sample and incubated at 44.5\u00b0C for 60 min. The amount of fluorescent label liberated by enzymatic hydrolysis is then determined by instrumental fluorescence spectrometry. Initial field trials show that enzyme activity levels correlated well with faecal coliforms concentrations measured by conventional membrane filtration methods. The enzyme activity level corresponding to the European Community guideline limit for bathing waters of 100 faecal coliforms/100 ml was easily detectable. The method is intended for use as an \u2018early warning\u2019 indicator of sewage contamination events in coastal waters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8846633518695866977", "cites_id": ["8846633518695866977"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969794900264", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YWLuU1COxXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
