Examinations of a number of standard isotherms indicated that the adsorptiondata can be best represented by the Freundlich equation. Correlation analysis between the adsorption capacity of PAHs and physical and chemical characteristics of fly ashes indicated that the residual carbon content is the main regulating parameter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "IeEt6fQAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9601408405472012745", "cites_id": ["9601408405472012745"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00168a013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yembBxMOP4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 5, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
