The model was used to simulate above- and belowground growth, grain yield, water and N uptake, and soil water and soil N in wheat crops in Western Australia. Model outputs were compared with detailed field experiments from four rainfall zones, three soil types, and five wheat genotypes. The field experiments covered 10 seasons, with variations in sowing date, plant density, N fertiliser, deep ripping and irrigation. The overall APSIM model predictions of shoot growth, root depth, water and N uptake, soil water, soil N, drainage and nitrate leaching were found to be acceptable. Grain yields were well predicted with a coefficient of determination r2(1:1)=0.77, despite some underestimation during severe terminal droughts. Yields tended to be underestimated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 364, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11904941250393668728", "cites_id": ["11904941250393668728"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429097001172", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ePyb_f3YNqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 7, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 13, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 11, "2008": 9, "2009": 15, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 11, "2013": 22, "2014": 22, "2015": 21, "2016": 28, "2017": 22, "2018": 24, "2019": 17, "2020": 20, "2021": 22, "2022": 21, "2023": 5}}
