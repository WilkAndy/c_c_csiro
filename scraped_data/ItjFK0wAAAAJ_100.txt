These experiments provided a wealth of data on the soil properties of five soil types in the Gooburrum\u2013Moore Park area of Bundaberg. A compilation of the data is presented here and includes soil profile descriptions, particle size and chemical analyses, bulk density, water retention and hydraulic conductivity measurements. The presentation contains a discussion of the uncertainty associated with experimental data focussing on bulk density, for which several methods were employed.To interpret and extrapolate the results of the cropping trials, simulation analysis was employed. The data presented in this report were collected to parameterise the hydraulic property functions of two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13340460873359792627", "cites_id": ["13340460873359792627"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith-Bristow/publication/237627002_Properties_of_selected_soils_in_the_Gooburrum_-_Moore_Park_area_of_Bundaberg/links/00b4952630f05198ca000000/Properties-of-selected-soils-in-the-Gooburrum-Moore-Park-area-of-Bundaberg.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:85mbyHvWIrkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
