Eco-efficiency is a multi-dimensional concept relating the efficiency with which a bundle of desired outputs is produced from a bundle of inputs, with minimal generation of undesired outputs. An analysis framework based on efficiency frontiers relating outputs to inputs (or where relevant, outputs to risk) is presented and this framework is used to identify six pathways for system improvement\u2014all addressing some dimension of eco-efficiency. The paper concludes with an analysis of how climate change impacts and adaptation can be factored into this eco-efficiency framework. labor by changing their location, diet, and hunting and gathering practices to match seasonal and spatial patterns in food supply. Early cultivation practices evolved in ways that made the most efficient use of labor, enabling human society to"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5827104327974848818", "cites_id": ["5827104327974848818"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132665065.pdf#page=30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MgkVUoMI3lAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
