This has however required careful matching of SWIMv2 calculations with those carried out by other modules in APSIM which use a fixed time step, usually one day. Having achieved a successful coupling, crop modules in APSIM can now be easily configured to take advantage of SWIM\u2019s soil water and solute transport capabilities, its physically based methods for describing flows across the soil-plant interface, and its ability to deal with changing surface conditions and wide range of boundary conditions. APSIM-SWIM has also been configured to transport multi-solutes with the water. At this stage the solutes are assumed to move through the soil matrix without interacting with each \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13961331482313203410", "cites_id": ["13961331482313203410"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1996/poster/667huth_39a.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0p7BSgOdwMEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
