The APSIM system model was used to simulate the observed chloride movement patterns and then investigate the influence of alternative cropping rotations with both conventionally tilled and zero tilled fallows. Simulation results demonstrated that within the period 1969 to 1992, there were only three periods of rapid leaching. Those cropping systems which kept the soil dry, reduced drainage and chloride movement during these periods. Zero tillage combined with long fallows moved the most chloride whereas conventional tillage combined with shorter fallows and more intensive cropping moved the least."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17512253953776611685", "cites_id": ["17512253953776611685"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1996/contributed/558Turpin.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZfFI4y8GCPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1}}
