The comparative salt tolerance of some tropical pasture legumes was studied in pots with NaCl added to a clay soil to achieve electrical conductivities (saturated extract, ECe) over the range 2.0- 20.0 dS m-1. Tolerance, based on EC, at 50% of maximum growth (in parentheses) was in the order: Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro (10.6)> Macroptilium lathyroides cv. Murray (9.9) > Vigna trilobata (9.7) > Indigofera spicata (9.5) > Desmanthus subulatus (9.3) > Arachis pintoi (7.9) > Clitoria ternatea (6.4) > Stylosanthes scabra (5.6) > Indigofera schimperi (5.4) > Psoralea tenax (5.3) > Rhynchosia minima (5.1). The grass Panicum coloratum cv. Bambatsi was markedly more tolerant than any of the legumes studied, with 50% yield at an EC, of 16.4 dS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12725452703670484132", "cites_id": ["12725452703670484132"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea9860181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pDxQyM_jmbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
