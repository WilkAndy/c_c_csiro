To help reach that goal, it will adopt and recommend modular approaches that facilitate more systematic model development, documentation, maintenance, and sharing. In this paper, we present criteria and guidelines for modules that will enable them to be plugged into existing models to replace an existing component or to add a new one with minimal changes. This will make it possible to accept contributions from a wide group of modellers with specialities in different disciplines. Two approaches to modular model development have emerged from different research groups in ICASA. One approach was developed by extending the programming methods used in the Fortran Simulation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 255, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14968388242359750454", "cites_id": ["14968388242359750454"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X01000543", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:No_87cxlus8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 14, "2010": 17, "2011": 10, "2012": 10, "2013": 18, "2014": 19, "2015": 15, "2016": 15, "2017": 22, "2018": 15, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 18, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
