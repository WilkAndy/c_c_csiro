Plants of cultivars M Aus 7 and M Aus 10 were grown under short (10-h) and long (16-h) photoperiods and harvested at approximately weekly intervals for a period of 13 weeks. Long photoperiods resulted in large increases in leaf area through increases in both number (both cultivars) and size of leaves (M Aus 7 only). The timing, extent and anatomical characteristics of storage root initiation were similar for both cultivars under 10-h and 16-h photoperiods but the subsequent balance between shoot and storage root growth strongly favoured shoot growth in long days. Dry matter partitioning followed a simple allometric pattern with the proportionality between the relative growth rate of shoots and the relative growth rate of storage roots remaining constant with time but being altered by photoperiod.
