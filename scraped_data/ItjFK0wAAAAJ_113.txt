Agron", "volume": "23", "pages": "206-209", "abstract": "A simple model of a maize/legume pasture intercrop was developed, validated and used to assess the performance of rainfed maize crops grown with an understorey of legume pasture at Katherine, NT. In over 80 of the 100 years for which the model was run, grain yield for maize grown with a legume understorey was lower than the yield of a sole maize crop. Whilst this system is unquestionably of benefit for soil conservation, acceptance by farmers will depend on the relative economic value of maize grain compared to dry season forage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=228488103756354835", "cites_id": ["228488103756354835"], "pub_url": "https://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/1992/concurrent/modelling-decision-support/p-05.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E9XMQ7jAKwMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
