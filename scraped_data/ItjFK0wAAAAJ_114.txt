The decision to invest in such storages is complex and multi-facetted, requiring assessment of a range of biophysical, economic, legislative and social factors. Computer-based simulation models can capture many of these factors and their interactions and, hence, can play a useful decision support role. This paper describes a prototype software package (Dam Ea $ y) that couples biophysical and economic modelling tools in a way that enables analysis of the likely costs and benefits of various scenarios involving investment in OFWSs. The paper includes a case study in which the implications of investing in different sized OFWSs are considered for a representative Bundaberg sugarcane farm, currently operating with access to a small scheme allocation and out of allocation water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14854893572546051697", "cites_id": ["14854893572546051697"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001812029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cT7X5_8uJ84J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1}}
