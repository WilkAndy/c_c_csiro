A series of 3 experiments were carried out at Katumani while at Kiboko and Ithookwe one experiment was conducted at each site. The evaluation was conducted in double rows of 2 m long for each accession consisting of fertilized and unfertilized rows. The plant population, accumulated herbage growth ie visual bulk rating (VBR) and insects pests and diseases incidences were monitored at monthly interval for a period of 2 wet and 2 dry seasons. Generally majority of the legumes established well, but the Stylosanthes genus was superior to the other genera and had highest number of accessions with high plant population (at least 10 plants per 2 m row) across all sites. In Experiment 1, at Katumani, there were 19 accessions of Stylosanthes out of the 31 accessions that achieved 10 plants per 2 metres planting row while at Kiboko, 20 out of 37 accessions that achieved 10 plants per 2 m row met this criteria. The other genus that showed high plant survival was Cassia followed by a few species in the Macrotyloma and Rhynchosia genera while the genus Macroptilium was restricted to Ithookwe. Only a limited number of species failed to establish in each site. Three different maturity groups were identified, short lived annuals (SLA)(33 accessions), long lived annuals (LLA)(34 accessions) and perennials (88 accessions). There were differences between the maturity groups in the VBR. The SLA had a high VBR at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1801156173579434124", "cites_id": ["1801156173579434124"], "pub_url": "https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/939/93940105.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jDg0N__9_hgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
