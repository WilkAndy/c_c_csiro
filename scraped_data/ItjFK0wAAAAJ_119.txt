The legumes were sown in plots of 4 mx 4 m and after emergence, they were monitored for population and repeatedly harvested for accumulated dry matter production for a period of 3 rainy seasons comprising about one and half years. There were significant (P< 0.05) difference in numbers of plants and dry matter (DM) production between legumes within the same site. Major LLA, Lablab purpureus cv. Rongai and Dolichos lablab K1002, and SLA, Vigna unguiculata cvv. Red Caloona and M66 had highest plant numbers at establishment in all the sites. While the LLA showed a reduced plant numbers towards the end of experiment, the SLA failed to persist beyond the second rainy season. For the perennials, although plant numbers declined after establishment, they maintained a reasonable plant population at the end of the experimental period. There was poor survival of all legumes at Kiboko compared to the other sites and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12341581093367752941", "cites_id": ["12341581093367752941"], "pub_url": "https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/939/93940201.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7ajcrJ0aRqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
