Utilising upon these constructs, we review six types of farming systems analysis and intervention that have evolved over the last 40 years, namely: (1) economic decision analysis based on production functions, (2) dynamic simulation of production processes, (3) economic decision analysis linked to biophysical simulation, (4) decision support systems, (5) expert systems, and (6) simulation-aided discussions about management in an action research paradigm. Biophysical simulation modelling features prominently in this list of approaches and considerable progress has been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 246, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5734989627880642226", "cites_id": ["5734989627880642226"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X01000592", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:shZgaK7Glk8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 8, "2004": 10, "2005": 12, "2006": 14, "2007": 17, "2008": 13, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 23, "2012": 22, "2013": 5, "2014": 15, "2015": 13, "2016": 15, "2017": 11, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
