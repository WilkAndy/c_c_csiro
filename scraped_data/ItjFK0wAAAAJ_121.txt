This catchment was selected because it is upstream of a gauging station showing an apparent rise in conductivity, that was interpreted as rising saline discharge from the catchment; it has an active Landcare group; and it is in a high rainfall zone that makes afforestation a commercially viable option for control of recharge and, hence, dryland salinity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8702620092470007435", "cites_id": ["8702620092470007435"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43535710/Assessment_of_Salinity_Management_Option20160309-22038-k6b87i.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ixbamt3qxXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
