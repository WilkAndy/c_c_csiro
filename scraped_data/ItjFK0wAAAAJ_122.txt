The modeling analysis focused on responses to investment in nitrogen fertilizer inputs, in terms of investments in timely sowing and weeding. The study evaluated a number of alternative scenarios of land, labor, and financial constraints for a farm household which were based on local information. Scenarios were established whereby the resources available could be deployed in different ways over multiple fields on the farm. In one scenario, fertilizer inputs, and weeding and plowing/sowing efforts were concentrated on a portion of the farm and the remainder was left idle. In another scenario, the resources were spread evenly over the whole farm; others involved the shifting of resources between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4513986192926983510", "cites_id": ["4513986192926983510"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4513986192926983510&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VkVuvobmpD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
