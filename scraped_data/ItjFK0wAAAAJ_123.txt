Sites with winter-dominant rainfall (Hamilton, Albany) had a high potential for relatively large amounts of drainage (average: 100-200 mm/year), whereas at Tamworth (summer-dominant rainfall) the likelihood of drainage events was low. Shifting from annual to perennial pastures at Hamilton and Albany reduced drainage by 32-44%.? Maintenance of vigorous pasture growth (high soil fertility) was predicted to also have incremental benefits but changes to grazing rotations and pasture rests were of no benefit. Mature woodlots at Hamilton and Albany exhibited virtually no drainage. In winter-dominant rainfall areas, changes to management of pasture systems alone will only have a relatively small impact on drainage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11306381119949293464", "cites_id": ["11306381119949293464"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/1998/2/072simpson.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mMfCjblV6JwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
