In real terms, population pressure on the land is among the most severe in the world. While Kenya ranks much lower than both Bangladesh and India (Binswanger and Pingali 1988) in terms ofpeople per hectare, ifland area is weighted by its potential productivity, the rankings change dramatically. Figure 1 expresses population pressure as people per million kilocalorie potential production and includes only people who work in agriculture: Kenya comes near the top. Pressure on land in the Machakos-Kitui districts of Kenya is particularly severe (Higgins et at. 1982).The options for response to this problem, which have been presented in the introductory paper (McCown and Jones, these proceedings), are compared in Figure 2. Option A, out-migration to urban centres, generally precedes successful implementation of B or C. Remittances from urban workers provide security for the household and possible capital inputs to farm production. The future contribution of this option as a means of relieving pressure on land depends on the rate of employment growth relative to population growth."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12063623306482554342", "cites_id": ["12063623306482554342"], "pub_url": "http://repository.seku.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/123456789/1023/Nguluu_Model%20development%20in%20Northern%20Australia%20and%20relevance%20to%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#page=125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5hUEP3uZaqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
