GIES considered in the previous paper involved management practices that were fixed, irrespective of seasonal prospects. In contrast, farmers frequently vary their management either consciously or subconsciously in response to their perceptions of the rainfall prospects for the current season.'Response farming'was a scheme developed in Kenya to forecast the potential of the pending growing season using rules based on time of season onset and early cumulative rainfall (Stewart and Hash 1982; Stewart and Faught 1984; Stewart 1988. 1991). The scheme included tactical responses, such as adjustments in crop densities and nitrogen fertiliser, to better match agronomic management with seasonal potential. In seasons forecast as having a high yield potential. bigh plant populations and nitrogen fertiliser side-dressings were recommended. In seasons forecast as having low yield potential, recommendations were to thin plant stands to reduce demand for soil resources and not add additional nitrogen fertiliser.Although the concepts embodied in response farming are intuitively attractive, there had been no means by which its value in terms of increased productivity or reduced risk could be assessed. This is because the value of response farming can not be determined experimentally. given the interseasonal variability in rainfall that characterises semi-arid Kenya. Stewart and Kashasha (1984) present the results of an evaluation conducted on seven farms in one season. Clear benefits of nitrogen fertilisation were obtained, but it is not possible to separate the value of fertilisation from the value of the response farming forecast per se.
