We shall consider some principles of simulation modeling and its place in the study of biophysical issues. The biophysical dimension of agricultural systems is set in the context of a wider management or human activity system. Experiences with model application in eastern and southern Africa are reviewed and issues relevant to choice of model considered. We illustrate these issues un application of the APSIM model to issues of soil water and fertility management in maize based systems in KenyaModels: Description and Rationale a"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6731634640952638106", "cites_id": ["6731634640952638106"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2AxSBV7o5cwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA67&dq=info:mjqySwqSa10J:scholar.google.com&ots=r0WrvwZbJU&sig=-MAb_GIT4HFQZrCeO9C30gGW-eY", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mjqySwqSa10J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
