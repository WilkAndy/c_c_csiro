However, measurement and interpretation of WUE and NUE in the field are often hampered by the high degree of complexity of these systems due to season-to-season variability in rainfall, the variation in crop responses to soil types and to agronomic management. To be able to guide agronomic practice, experimentally-derived measurements of WUE and NUE need to be extrapolated across time and space through appropriate modelling. To illustrate this approach, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), which has been rigorously tested for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a Mediterranean environment, was used to estimate and analyse the WUE and NUE of wheat crops \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 220, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17183847239442036910", "cites_id": ["17183847239442036910"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010381602223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rviENQVKee4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 12, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 6, "2009": 14, "2010": 11, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 14, "2014": 14, "2015": 12, "2016": 15, "2017": 15, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 14, "2021": 17, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
