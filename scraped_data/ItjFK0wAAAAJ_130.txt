Proceedings of the 14th Australian agronomy \u2026, 2008", "author": "BA Keating and PS Carberry", "journal": "Global Issues Paddock Action. Proceedings of the 14th Australian agronomy conference, Adelaide, Australia", "pages": "21-25", "abstract": "Agriculture globally and in Australia is at a critical juncture in its history with the current changes to input costs, commodity prices, consumption patterns and food stocks. Constraints are emerging in terms of land and water resources as well as imperatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the face of a carbonconstrained world. There is evidence that rates of increase in agricultural productivity are slowing, both in Australia and overseas. On top of all these drivers of change, agriculture is the sector probably most exposed to climate change, and Australian agriculture is as exposed as any in the world.Against this turbulent background, we review the emerging opportunities (and threats) for Australian agriculture. We consider topical opportunities associated with new products or services from agriculture, namely biofuels, forest-based carbon storage in agricultural landscapes, bio-sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils, and environmental stewardship schemes that would reward farmers for nature conservation and related non-production services from farming land. While there are situations where all these emerging opportunities will have a place and will deliver benefits to both farmers and the wider community, our overall conclusion is that none of these, on their own, will transform the nature of Australian agriculture."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14078656968669954314", "cites_id": ["14078656968669954314"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5fdcf58ea5ea70eaa19cbc075a20e0509cebaeab", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CoEmzOtvYcMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2}}
