The calculator utilises various methodologies, including the agricultural production systems model APSIM, algorithms from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Committee (NGGIC), and various other established relationships. Use of the calculator is demonstrated via a case study for the Mossman region in north Queensland. The results for this system show that, while the primary sugarcane production sector is a net greenhouse gas sink, much of the assimilated carbon is eventually released upon bagasse combustion at the mill. Potential applications of the calculator include the estimation of current greenhouse gas emission levels and investigation of abatement strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15747050593384985093", "cites_id": ["15747050593384985093"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2001/6/d/lisson.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BfLQThXDiNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1}}
