To date, however, there has been no measure of the input of N into Australian sugarcane via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). This study aims to identify N 2-fixing sugarcane cultivars and investigate the input of N, via BNF, into commercial sugarcane cultivars grown in Australia using nitrogen isotopic techniques. The leaf \u03b4 15 N of sugarcane was sampled for a range of cultivars at eight commercial sugarcane sites in Queensland and New South Wales, and the potential contribution from BNF calculated. At seven of the sites sampled the leaf \u03b4 15 N values of the sugarcane was greater than 4, a \u03b4 15 N value range not indicative of substantial BNF inputs. The remaining site (Broadwater) however, had \u03b4 15 N values less than 4. At four of the sites, reference plants were sampled allowing for the calculation of relative input of N from BNF (% N BNF) for the sugarcane at these sites. For two sites, the calculated% N BNF showed no N input from BNF, while the remaining two sites (Harwood and Broadwater) showed moderate N inputs (13.1 to 44.6%). At one of these sites (Harwood), this result is seen to be an artifact of the technique. The encouraging Broadwater result appears to be site specific. The same sugarcane cultivars sampled from other sites had higher \u03b4 15 N values, and calculations of% N BNF did not support BNF as an N source at these sites. The Broadwater site had unique soil conditions, which may have either resulted in lower leaf \u03b4 15 N values or have been favourable for N 2-fixation in the sugarcane at this site.
