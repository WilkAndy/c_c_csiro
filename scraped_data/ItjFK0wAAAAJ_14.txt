This additional food demand, expressed in kilocalories, represents a \u201cmega-wedge\u201d akin to the carbon stabilisation wedges of Pacala and Socolow (2004). This food demand challenge consists of three component \u201cfood wedges\u201d classed according to their target pathways: i.e. pathways that target reducing food demand; pathways that target increasing food production; and pathways that target sustaining the productive capacity of food systems. In this paper we examine these wedges in terms of prospective pathways through which food supply and demand can stay in balance over the next 40 years. Within these wedge classes, we nominate 14 pathways that are likely to make up the food \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 208, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14019686612980973654", "cites_id": ["14019686612980973654"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912414000327", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VsAH7bHuj8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 17, "2018": 11, "2019": 19, "2020": 45, "2021": 46, "2022": 33, "2023": 17}}
