The soils are very sandy with very low organic matter (Aore and Gatahi 990). Normal farming practice in the region involves little return of crop residues or use of manure. The particular terrace chosen for this experiment yielded only 80 kg grainlha in the season prior to the experiment despite good rainfalL Similar problems confront many resource-poor farmers in semi-arid regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11856700589434277789", "cites_id": ["11856700589434277789"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=cc3ea7dad1705bd61337f8e80d65b041f889ab2f#page=46", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nQ9l2V12i6QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
