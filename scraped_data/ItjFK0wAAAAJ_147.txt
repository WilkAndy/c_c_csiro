Very early in that history, the desirability of generic simulation tools was recognized (eg Beek & Frissel. 1973). Over time the following attributes have been recognized as desirable in a generic agricultural simulation tool:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2332971918216348291", "cites_id": ["2332971918216348291"], "pub_url": "https://www.apsim.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Protocol-Specification.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g0I_WJlhYCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
