The emphasis of the study was on the drainage term in the water balance because of the significance of waterlogging, salinization and soil acidity as threats to the sustainability of the Australian pastoral industry. The sites where pasture production was simulated was near Hamilton in Victoria, near Albany in Western Australia, and near Quirindi in New South Wales. The impacts of different grazing management practices, different pasture species (annual versus perennial), the introduction of trees, and variability in climate on the local water balance, are determined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8159218770966356423", "cites_id": ["8159218770966356423"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033092720", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xyEmKD5eO3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
