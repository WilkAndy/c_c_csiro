Strategies are being soughtto increase water and nitrogen (N) use in the legume-based cropping systems. Choice of appropriate management strategies is complicated by the diversity of soil types, the range of crops, and the inherent season to season variability. Simulation models provide the means to extrapolate beyond the bounds of experimental data if accurate predictions of key processes can be demonstrated. This paper evaluates the accuracy of predictions of soil water content, evapotranspiration, drainage, inorganic N content insoil, nitrate (NO-3) leaching, wheat growth, N uptake, and grain yields obtained from the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model when this was initialised with appropriate information on soil properties and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1066591432223876432", "cites_id": ["1066591432223876432"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/a97095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UOUtrkFLzQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 6, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 9, "2002": 10, "2003": 12, "2004": 9, "2005": 5, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 19, "2010": 9, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
