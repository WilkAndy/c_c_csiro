How quickly lucerne dries out the profile, and how quickly rewetting occurs under cereal crops depends on factors such as weather, soil type, and crop/pasture management. Simulations using the systems model APSIM (Agricultural Productions Systems Simulator, 2) have proven useful to analyse the effects of these factors in lucerne-wheat rotations. Here we illustrate how simulations using historical weather data can be used to evaluate measurements that could be used as an aid in determining when to change phase."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17733998125751606195", "cites_id": ["17733998125751606195"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2001/p/1/verburg.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sxveLFbRG_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3}}
