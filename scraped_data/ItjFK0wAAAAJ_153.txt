The fate of a combined application of N-fertiliser and bromide tracer was monitored by regular soil sampling during the 1992/93 season. Soil hydraulic properties were obtained in the field (hydraulic conductivity near saturation) and using undisturbed soil cores in the lab (water retention curves). APSIM-SWIM was configured to run with a crop module for sugarcane (2) and a soil nitrogen module (SOILN)(4)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8532453105531514194", "cites_id": ["8532453105531514194"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1996/poster/667huth.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Um3igeRcaXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
