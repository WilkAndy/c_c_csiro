Temperatures are strongly correlated with plant population and nitrogen management altitude in this equatorial region (Griffiths, strategies (Keating et al., 1989). 1972); mean annual temperatures in maize growing areas range from 13 to 27 C. Rainfall regimes The wider application of such models requires that they adequately simulate the variation in vary greatly across the country, from the semicrop growth and development that arises from arid eastern midlands with less than 250 mm rainfall expectation in a very short season, to the the use of different germplasm in different agro-ecozones. The objective of this study was to humid central highlands which receive more than 1600 mm over a much longer growing season \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11263551498653520580", "cites_id": ["11263551498653520580"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00128325.1990.11663576", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xNKPQmksUJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1}}
