Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures, 1986", "author": "JR Marchant and BA Keating and MA Foale", "publisher": "St Lucia, Qld, CSIRO. Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures", "abstract": "An inexpensive root washing device that has proved to be successful for extracting roots from cracking clay soil samples of up to 500 g is described. The unit is constructed from two different sized sections of standard PVC pipe fastened to a moulded fibreglass separating cone. A matching sieve is made from half a standard PVC coupling. Water jets powered by normal mains pressure of around 700 kPa and connected through standard hose fittings, agitate the soil sample and separate the roots. A procedure for handling soil samples and extracting root data is also described. A scaled up version of the device has been constructed to process large soil samples (1 to 10kg), which are used in root biomass estimations. This unit is based on the lower half of a 200 litre steel drum and is fitted with a metal cone and central pipe."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15389232492959554160", "cites_id": ["15389232492959554160"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:21533eb9-05cb-4add-ba1e-645808494dcd", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cNrArGqJkdUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2}}
