We envision new data, models and knowledge products that could accelerate the innovation process that is needed to achieve the goal of achieving sustainable local, regional and global food security. We identify desirable features for models, and describe some of the potential advances that we envisage for model components and their integration. We propose an implementation strategy that would link a \u201cpre-competitive\u201d space for model development to a \u201ccompetitive space\u201d for knowledge product development and through private-public partnerships for new data infrastructure. Specific model improvements would be based on further testing and evaluation of existing models, the development and testing of modular model components \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1755162903067985983", "cites_id": ["1755162903067985983"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X16306096", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P4hPcFyXWxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 11, "2018": 16, "2019": 29, "2020": 45, "2021": 23, "2022": 25, "2023": 10}}
