The results confirm the findings of earlier workers that specific gravity can provide a reliable estimate of storage root DM in the absence of drying facilities. A curvilinear relationship of the form 1/y = a + bx was found to exist between storage root DM and percentage of starch or fermentables within one cultivar over a range of ages and seasonal conditions. This relationship shows that the proportion of total DM present as starch or fermentables increases for samples of higher DM percentages. A similar relationship was shown to exist between specific gravity and percentage of starch or fermentables. A linear relationship was also developed between the percentage of DM and of fermentables based on 28 cultivars harvested at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6827152770837704993", "cites_id": ["6827152770837704993"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.2740321008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IfEa9UXrvl4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
