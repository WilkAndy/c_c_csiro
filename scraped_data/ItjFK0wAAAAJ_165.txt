The HWQMP was initiated by stakeholders in the Herbert River Catchment who were dissatisfied with the lack of local data available to validate the proposed Paddock to Reef (P2R) Monitoring and Modelling Program. The Queensland Government's original intention was to use recent data generated from other catchments (Tully) in the Wet Tropics to validate catchment model scenarios for the Herbert Catchment. This program aimed to provide scientifically robust water quality (WQ) data to be used in association with previously collected WQ data to estimate loads on a catchment scale for the validation of models, as well as to provide insight into relative concentrations of reef pollutants on a sub-catchment and paddock scale for use by extension staff and catchment managers to improve sustainable land management practices which will lead to improved WQ to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=631671607333580885", "cites_id": ["631671607333580885"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=631671607333580885&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VXDR6folxAgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
