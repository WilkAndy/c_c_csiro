The experiment was designed to examine the effects of tillage, stubble management, and nitrogen (N) fertiliser on the productivity of a winter cereal-summer fallow cropping system. it commenced in 1968 and the treatments have been maintained until the present. CENTURY operates on a monthly time step, considers all soil N transformations to occur in a single soil layer, and has a very simple crop growth routine that does not deal with crop phenology. APSIM provides a framework whereby a model of a cropping system is configured from component modules, which operate on a daily time step. For simulating the Hermitage experiment, modules to represent the dynamics of soil-water, N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7995351387294783300", "cites_id": ["7995351387294783300"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea9950941", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RNchvrkx9W4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 12, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 12, "2002": 11, "2003": 7, "2004": 4, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 9, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
