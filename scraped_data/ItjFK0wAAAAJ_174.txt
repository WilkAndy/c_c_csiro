The shoot yield of guar and cowpea was reduced to 50% of the control, at soil salt levels corresponding to electrical conductivities determined on saturated extracts (ECe,50%) of 11.8 and 11.6 dS m-1 respectively, the response being independent of the form of salt used. Both these species maintained low Na+ in shoots but accumulated moderate levels of Cl- in the presence of Cl- salts. The shoot yield of blackgram was less affected by CaCl2 salinity than NaCl salinity (i.e. ECe,50% = 13.6 dS m-1 compared with 8.8 dS m-1 respectively), whilst the growth response to Na2SO, was intermediate (ECe,50% = 10.8 dS m-1. Blackgram was found to accumulate large quantities of both Na+ (up to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13106082473880293799", "cites_id": ["13106082473880293799"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar9860167", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p5GbLJIo4rUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
