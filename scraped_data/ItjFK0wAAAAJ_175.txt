The mean of a set of soil temperature measurements at one location at this altitude was 17.9 \u00baC. Experimental work in Queensland has indicated that a mean soil temperature of 18 C is the lowest temperature for satisfactory cassava establishment. It is suggested that the upper attitudinal limit of cassava in PNG is related to soil temperature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8108878613620787786", "cites_id": ["8108878613620787786"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sta.uwi.edu/ojs/index.php/ta/article/view/2350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Sgqh6yKGiHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1}}
