We envision new models and knowledge products that could accelerate the innovation process that is needed to achieve the goal of achieving sustainable local, regional and global food security. We identify desirable features for models, and describe some of the potential advances that we envisage for model components and their integration. We also discuss possible advances in model evaluation and strategies for model improvement, an important part of achieving our vision. We conclude with a multi-pronged implementation strategy that includes more thorough testing and evaluation of existing models, the development and testing of modular model components and integration, improvements in data management and visualization tools, and development of knowledge-products for end users."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17445658698686098068", "cites_id": ["17445658698686098068"], "pub_url": "https://agmip.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Towards-a-New-Generation-of-Ag-Systems-Complete.pdf#page=67", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lGrjxyduG_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
