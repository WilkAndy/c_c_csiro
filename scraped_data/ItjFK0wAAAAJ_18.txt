However, quantifying potential drainage through measurements is hampered by the high degree of complexity of these systems as a result of diverse soil types, a range of crops, different rainfall regions, and in particular the inherent season-to-season variability. Simulation models can provide the appropriate means to extrapolate across time and space. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to analyse deep drainage under wheat crops in the Mediterranean climate of the central Western Australian wheatbelt. In addition to rigorous model testing elsewhere, comparisons between simulated and observed soil water loss, evapotranspiration, and deep drainage for different soil types and seasons confirmed the reasonable performance of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4324346091479323191", "cites_id": ["4324346091479323191"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar99186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N1J53NspAzwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 17, "2004": 7, "2005": 9, "2006": 12, "2007": 7, "2008": 7, "2009": 14, "2010": 7, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
