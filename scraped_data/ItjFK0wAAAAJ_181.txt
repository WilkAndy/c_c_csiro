It is proposed that such a model needs a geochemical basis if it is to cope explicitly with the mineral nutrition aspects (eg. Al toxicity) that are a consequence of soil acidification."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3083444758001449398", "cites_id": ["3083444758001449398"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1998/8/094verburg.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tnk3rauYyioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1}}
