Against a background of high rainfall variability, high potential for soil erosion, increasing salinity, increasing awareness regarding off-farm effects of agriculture and considerable fertility decline in some regions, the development, functionality and use of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) are described. Emphasis is on the presentation of past and current uses of this systems modelling capability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=753370058305574532", "cites_id": ["753370058305574532"], "pub_url": "https://edepot.wur.nl/336046#page=30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hBa4lROCdAoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2}}
