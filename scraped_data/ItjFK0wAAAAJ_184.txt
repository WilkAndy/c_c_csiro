The residue treatments affected SMB in the 0-15 cm soil layer, but not in deeper soil layers; no effects of fertiliser-N application on SMB were found. Inadequacies of current models to simulate changes in SMB, in response to added crop residues and through time, are discussed. The algorithm in CERES models that determines the effect of C: N ratio on the decomposition of residues is shown to give poor prediction of changes in SMB with respect to the type of residue added and the effects of fertiliser-N."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17662531360954623366", "cites_id": ["17662531360954623366"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1996/contributed/462probert.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hqXlU7HqHfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
