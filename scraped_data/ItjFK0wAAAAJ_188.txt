However, we disagree with recommendations that target some food categories. Variation in environmental footprint within a food category can be more important than the variation between categories. 2 Research on environmental modelling systems needs to address complex trade-offs between factors such as carbon emissions, water, land use and biodiversity. Without this, we risk unintended adverse outcomes in other areas of environmental protection. 3 Therefore, we recommend the following strategies, where there is greater certainty of benefit."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3429882127686448105", "cites_id": ["3429882127686448105"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Caleb-Gardner/publication/274687258_Australia's_dietary_guidelines_and_the_environmental_impact_of_food_from_paddock_to_plate/links/5578cffc08ae752158703c5c/Australias-dietary-guidelines-and-the-environmental-impact-of-food-from-paddock-to-plate.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6TM2cp9jmS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
