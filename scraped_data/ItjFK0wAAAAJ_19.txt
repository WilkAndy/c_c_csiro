Walp.) were grown to examine how radiation interception and radiation-use efficiency (RUE) changed under intercropping. The work also examined whether intercropping advantage as measured by land equivalent ratio (LER) was determined by the yield of the dominated cowpea crop. In one experiment, maize plant density was varied and in another, it was held constant and 15 contrasting cowpea cultivars were used.Increased radiation interception by the intercrops prior to maize grain filling increased biomass production, particularly at the low maize density. There was, however, no intercropping advantage in RUE. Radiation-use efficiency of the combined intercrop was between that of maize and cowpea in sole cropping, the actual value being determined by the proportion of radiation intercepted by component crops.
