Current N fertilisation recommendations are broad and unrelated to any field specific measures of plant or soil N status. This paper describes research aimed at developing a monitoring system that would enable growers to assess N status of sugarcane crops on a block or sub-block basis. The method is based on the concentrations of amino acid (amino-N) in cane juice, measured at harvest time as it is delivered to the sugar mill. This information is then used to adjust N management on a block-specific basis in future seasons. This paper focuses on the factors that influence amino-N in cane at both plot and mill scales and prospects for an amino-N assay to identify cane crops that have experienced either insufficient or excess N supply."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11993210616464231745", "cites_id": ["11993210616464231745"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2001/1/c/keating.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QU3LToNxcKYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
