This project is located near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, Australia (latitude 35 07\u201955\u201d S) and includes estimation of deep drainage and solute leaching by measurement and simulation modelling.The leaching experiment was carried out in 1992 on one part of the field site being used for this project, namely a 1.5 ha block planted with P. radiata. This block is divided into eight plots which represent two replicates of each of four different irrigation treatments (Fig. 4.1). For the purpose of the present study, there were no differentces between the treatments can be ignored. The experiment was carried out at the end of the first irrigation season after the commencement of winter rainfall. At that time the soil profile water storage, as a percentage of saturation, was uniform across the block."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12275024608735662780", "cites_id": ["12275024608735662780"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=procite:c7c48a23-5818-4654-b432-a8376f073c27&dsid=DS1#page=33", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vBLehNilWaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
