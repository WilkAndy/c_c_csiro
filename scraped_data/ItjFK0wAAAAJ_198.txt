Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures", "abstract": "An efficient system for sampling large cores of clay soil with minimum disturbance is described. Such cores can be used in experiments where it is important that soil physical structure remains close to the natural state. The soil core is enclosed in standard PVC pipe which constitutes the wall of the coring device. A coring tip and a cap unit, made from hard steel, combine with the PVC pipe to form the coring unit. A powerful, truck-mounted, hydraulic drilling rig performs the sampling operation. A method for transforming the pipe and soil into a cylindrical pot for experimental use is described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15355386449046014521", "cites_id": ["15355386449046014521"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:d858a4c4-a629-4f85-9acb-f2fcc2c076f4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OQo8fJ5KGdUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1}}
