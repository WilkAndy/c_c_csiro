However, previous analyses have indicated that model performance was poor in terms of grain protein simulations particularly under very high or very low N input conditions together with terminal drought. The original routine for grain protein content simulated grain protein as a function of independent dry matter and N accumulation into the grain. To constrain grain protein content simulations under very high and very low N input conditions, without effecting other simulations, a simple but physiologically sound link was incorporated between dry matter and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17344760461271856571", "cites_id": ["17344760461271856571"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030101001162", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u3VZOL73tPAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 7, "2005": 5, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
