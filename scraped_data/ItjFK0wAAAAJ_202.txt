Australian contributions to international FSR development and practice are widely recognized, notably in the CGIAR Centers, World Bank and ACIAR-supported international research partnerships. There has been a resurgence of interest in farming system approaches with the growing challenges of complex, uncertain, 'wicked' problems. McCown's leadership and insights helped shape a particular \"Australian-style\" of FSR and influenced international FSR practice over four decades, particularly the incorporation of simulation modelling in framing researcher connections with farmers' decision-making. The paper concludes with some priorities for refinement of FSR methods for international agricultural research \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.792354174134622", "cites_per_year": {}}
