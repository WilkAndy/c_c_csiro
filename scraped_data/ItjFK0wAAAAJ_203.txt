We discuss the state of models relative to five different Use Cases spanning field, farm, landscape, regional, and global spatial scales and engaging questions in past, current, and future time periods. Contributions from multiple disciplines have made major advances relevant to a wide range of agricultural system model applications at various spatial and temporal scales. Although current agricultural systems models have features that are needed for the Use Cases, we found that all of them have limitations and need to be improved. We identified common limitations across all Use Cases, namely 1) a scarcity of data for developing, evaluating, and applying agricultural system models and 2) inadequate knowledge systems that effectively communicate model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7867427243745948379&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
