It explores whether there are points of convergence indicating that the two issues can and should now be researched in a more integrated way. The paper does this by reviewing the institutional history of climate-related R&D in Australian agriculture since reforms to drought policy in the early 1990s. It also draws on the reflections of R&D program managers and leading researchers from around Australia on the trajectory of adaptation and mitigation related research. The insights gathered from the literature and consultation are organised using frameworks that link adaptation and mitigation to agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rohan-Nelson/publication/275523311_Climate_change_adaptation_mitigation_in_agriculture_-_complementary_or_conflicting/links/5be13ca3a6fdcc3a8dc17d4c/Climate-change-adaptation-mitigation-in-agriculture-complementary-or-conflicting.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FAp50q09ImgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
