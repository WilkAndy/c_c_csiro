Since high N supply can decrease the sucrose concentration in fresh millable stalks and consequently decrease the commercial value of the stalks, the opportunity exists to manipulate N supply (both from fertiliser and that mineralised from soil organic matter) to maximise economic return at different times of harvest. Accordingly, this study describes how N supply the time-course of sucrose accumulation in sugarcane and determines yield both on a dry weight basis (as commonly analysed by crop physiologists) and on a fresh weight basis (which is how cane is paid for commercially). Data on crop N uptake and its efficiency of utilisation are also presented. There was a trade-off between maximising sucrose yield and sucrose concentration in fresh millable stalks with different N supply and this varied with time of harvest.
