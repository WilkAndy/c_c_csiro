While nitrogen applications are essential for profitable and sustainable intensive cropping, losses of nitrogen from the production system degrade soils through acidification and pose a significant environmental risk to surface freshwaters, groundwaters and marine systems. Efficient nitrogen management in sugarcane systems has been hampered by the lack of a relevant, costeffective method of assessing the nitrogen status of sugarcane crops and/or soils. Other projects have demonstrated how the nitrogen status of cane delivered to mills can be an effective indicator of the nitrogen supply under which this cane was produced (the \u201cN at the Mill\u201d concept). The amino-N component of the total-N in the cane has been the primary target for this monitoring, as earlier studies have demonstrated this component shows higher levels of sensitivity to external N supply than does total-N. Such information can be potentially used to adjust nitrogen management in future crops on a block-specific basis. Other studies have demonstrated this approach is most effective at detecting situations of excess nitrogen supply. It is under such situations that a diagnostic test is most needed, as they are the conditions that pose greatest environmental risk and where traditional tests (such as leaf tissue analysis) are least effective. This project has focused almost entirely on overcoming the challenge of achieving a cost-effective method of monitoring nitrogen in cane as it is processed in the mill. The target methodology has been Near-Infrared Spectrometry (NIR), and the challenge has been to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13978", "cites_per_year": {}}
