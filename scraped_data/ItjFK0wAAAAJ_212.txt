While nitrogen (N) fertilisers are a significant input cost, nitrogen losses to groundwaters or surface waters are one of the most significant environmental concerns. Whilst data on direct impacts on coastal ecosystems are sparse, elevated levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment pose the greatest risk of sugar industry impact on the neighbouring sensitive freshwater and marine ecosystems. While the risks of nitrogen losses to the environment are high, there are many features of the Australian sugar industry that mitigate against these risks. A perennial grass crop, with a relatively low requirement for nitrogen, sugarcane is better adapted than almost any other form of agriculture to the wet coastal environments of north-eastern Australia. Reduced tillage and retention of trash as a surface mulch further reduce the risks of nutrient and sediment loss to waterways and marine environments. With respect to nitrogen management, the greatest risk to the environment is associated with over-fertilisation. Growers are naturally wary of economic losses associated with inadequate nitrogen supply and there was evidence of over-fertilisation with industrial N fertilisers at the time this project was initiated. Also the lack of a tool for monitoring crop N status meant that growers had little knowledge about the amount of N added to fields from other additional sources, such as, mill mud or residual N leftover from small crops or fallows. Economic forces associated with current low sugar prices may have tempered grower\u2019s tendency to over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13993", "cites_per_year": {}}
