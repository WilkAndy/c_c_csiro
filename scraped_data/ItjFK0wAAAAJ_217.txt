The technique is based on the nitrogen content of sugarcane juice at the mill. This information would be used in decision making on N fertilisation rates on a specific block basis in the subsequent season. Results from analysis of the N composition of cane stalks produced under a diverse range of experimental conditions indicate approximately 60\u201370% of the N in a cane stalk is contained in thc juice. Conditions that lead to high N supply (fertile soils, high N fertilisation rates, plant crops) result in high amino-N levels in the juice. Under N deficiency, amino-N levels drop to very low values. Water limitation interacts with N supply, and would need to be considered in interpretation of results. Results from monitoring at Macknade Mill during the 1996 crushing season indicate that considerable variation exists in the amino-N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nils-Berding/publication/307175918_Monitoring_nitrogen_at_the_mill_to_guide_N_fertilisation_practice_on_farm/links/57c4292008aee465796c01d7/Monitoring-nitrogen-at-the-mill-to-guide-N-fertilisation-practice-on-farm.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9siQi_xpQTMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
