This project explored the prospects for monitoring N composition in cane supply at the mill, as a means of assessing the adequacy ofN management on thefarm. The research showed that sugarcane contains considerable quantWes of nitrogen in its stems and much of this nitrogen is expressed in thejuice at the mill. Particular allentioll was paid to the N in juice present as amino acids (henceforth referred to as amino-NY. This N form was shown to be velY responsive to the N supply conditions under which the cane was grown. Factors such as high N fertiliser rates led to high levels of alllino-N which could be detected in the juice at harvest time. Under conditions when cane or sugar yields were reduced due to inadequate N supply, then amino-N concentrations dropped to very low levels. Other factors, such as moisture stress that reduced cane growth, had a corresponding effect on juice amino-N concentrations, while varieties appeared to have only a small effect on these relationships. This information based on experimental plots was used to developed indicative diagnostic relationships between amino-N concentrations in cane juice at harvest and the adequacy of N supply (eg deficient, adequate, excess). The project examined variation in amino-N in cane supply at the Mac/made Mill during the 1996 crushing season. This variation was related to factors such as crop class, variety, time of harvest, ccs, and farm supplying the cane. Extensive variation in amino-N concentrations was found in cane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13028", "cites_per_year": {}}
