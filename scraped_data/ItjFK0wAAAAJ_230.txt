The dominant theme is how subsistence farmers in semi-arid regions of Africa might improve the nutrition of their croplands. A number of possible options and strategies are reviewed, and the economic risks are explored with examples from Kenya and Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9500486", "cites_per_year": {}}
