In more elaborate modelling systems, pastures, animals and forests might feature as components of multi-paddock simulators. In this paper, we review developments in cropping systems models and their evolution from simpler crop models over the last 25 years. We trace the history of key modelling efforts in Europe, North America and Australia. In particular we explore:(a) Developing scale in cropping systems modelling efforts;(b) The evolving focus from crop models to cropping systems simulators;(c) Innovation in construction of cropping systems models;(d) The evolving focus for model application."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/12837/1/1-Final-Proceedings-AgSAP2009.pdf#page=210", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Kvo1Nxtrlx4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
