This eco-efficiency concept is used to diagnose the state of agricultural production in China (irrigated wheat\u2013maize double-cropping systems), Zimbabwe (rainfed maize systems), and Australia (rainfed wheat systems). More than 3,000 surveyed crop yields in these three countries were compared against simulated grain yields at farmer-specified levels of nitrogen (N) input. Many Australian commercial wheat farmers are both close to existing production frontiers and gain little prospective return from increasing their N input. Significant losses of N from their systems, either as nitrous oxide emissions or as nitrate leached from the soil profile, are infrequent and at low intensities relative to their level of grain production. These Australian farmers operate close to eco \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9113616167911702291", "cites_id": ["9113616167911702291"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1208050110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ez-iY54Ren4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 19, "2015": 17, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 6, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
