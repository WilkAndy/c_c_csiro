Also, there is a growing need for local independence from imports and an increasing recognition of the finite capacity of our atmosphere to absorb fossil-based greenhouse emissions.This CSIRO project, part of the Energy Transformed Flagship program, is developing an integrated assessment framework to evaluate the options and impacts of different strategies for alternative transport fuels\u2013including fossil-based and renewable sources. The framework will consist of a comparative approach to assessing options and impacts, from resource supplies, transformation processes and fuel types, through to vehicle/engine/fuel combinations, availability of refuelling and maintenance infrastructure and consumer acceptance. It will do so in an explicit and transparent manner, underpinned by collation and sifting of disparate data sources, and development of appropriate tools for analysis. The main outcome will be a \u2018Ready Reckoner\u2019to quantify as far as possible the outcomes and impacts of applying various assumptions and strategies; or to explore which strategies might be used in order to reach a desired outcome"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/2007/beert_xb.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z8F2PjOMwDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
