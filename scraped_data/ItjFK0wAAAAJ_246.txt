Food production is fundamentally dependent on water supply and in 2010, 40% of the world\u2019s food production was reliant on irrigation activities (Turral et al., 2011). Agriculture has always depended on energy inputs, initially human energy in hunting and gathering societies evolving to animal traction and then to fossil fuel based inputs in cultivation and fertiliser. Without fossil fuel based nitrogen fertilisers for instance, global food production would be almost halved (Smil, 2011). Energy inputs to water can transform salty water to fresh water suited to food production and move water against gravity to direct it to agricultural production activity.
