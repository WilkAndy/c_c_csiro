While this has improved crop productivity, it has also led to soil acidification, greenhouse gas emissions and contamination of groundwater and surface waters. When the timing and amount of nitrogen supply and demand are not well matched there is a risk of nitrogen losses to the environment. Controlled release fertilisers may provide an opportunity to move towards more environmentally sustainable intensification as these products allow a slow release of nitrogen controlled by the characteristics of their polymer coating (Shaviv, 2001). If synchronized with crop demand this slow release of fertiliser can potentially keep soil nitrogen levels low, improve crop nitrogen-use efficiency and reduce the risk of nitrogen losses. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated increased nutrient efficiency, reduced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18223360962361205741&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
