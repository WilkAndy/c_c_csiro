The farming system is the largely-subsistence production of crops and livestock by smallholders in the Machakos and Kitui Districts in Eastern Kenya. The region is known locally as Ukambani- \u201cthe place where the Kamba people live\u201d. This region has a long history in which the food demands of rapidly growing populations have periodically outstripped the productive capacity of the land and current technology. Today, the population pressure on land and its rate of growth are among the highest in the world, and emigration is no longer a feasible solution. But numerous other areas of Africa are not far behind in population pressures and a more sustainable agriculture in this region is important not only for Kenya. Almost certainly, the problems of agriculture in Machakos-Kitui today \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5109819133414656109", "cites_id": ["5109819133414656109"], "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003072709202100105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bcisyW256UYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 4, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
