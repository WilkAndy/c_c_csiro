The module simulates potential growth in relation to temperature and radiation. Water and nitrogen deficits limit production below this potential. Leaf appearance and expansion, light interception and radiation conversion to dry matter are simulated and dry matter partitioned to leaf blade, cabbage, structural stem, sucrose and root carbon pools. Water use and N uptake are performed by the sugar module, via communications with other APSIM soil modules which track the status of these variables. The module simulates plant/ratoon cycles for sugarcane cultivars that have been shown to differ in a small number of key physiological/genotypic parameters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1996/poster/674Keating-01.htm", "cites_per_year": {}}
