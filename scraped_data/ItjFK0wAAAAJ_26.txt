Using the Land-Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, we undertook a comprehensive, detailed, integrated, and quantitative scenario analysis of land-use and sustainability for Australia\u2019s agricultural land from 2013\u20132050, under interacting global change and domestic policies, and considering key uncertainties. We assessed land use competition between multiple land-uses and assessed the sustainability of economic returns and ecosystem services at high spatial (1.1 km grid cells) and temporal (annual) resolution. We found substantial potential for land-use transition from agriculture to carbon plantings, environmental plantings, and biofuels cropping under certain scenarios \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1327246392606995915", "cites_id": ["1327246392606995915"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yzXC4I9TaxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 14, "2018": 17, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 15, "2022": 21, "2023": 10}}
