Experimental data on the long-term effects of these practices on soil fertility and crop yield, and on their impact on the environment, are scarce, and difficult and costly to obtain. To address this problem, the CENTURY model was adapted to study the long-term effects of sugarcane trash management on soil organic matter (SOM) levels, N mineralization, nitrate leaching and crop yields with different fertilizer N inputs. Simulations were run using a 91 year weather record for unirrigated sugarcane grown on two soils in the Herbert River district of north Queensland. The model indicated that adoption of trash blanketing on old \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6775913250696945518", "cites_id": ["6775913250696945518"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167198796010148", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bl-ngDPhCF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 9, "2011": 11, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
