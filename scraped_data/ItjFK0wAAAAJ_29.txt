Water leaking below the root zone of annual crops and pastures in this region is leading to development of dryland salinity and delivery of salt to waterways. Simulation modelling was used to identify the relative magnitude of transpiration, soil evaporation, runoff and drainage and to explore temporal variability in these terms for selected locations over the 1957\u20131998 climate record. Two transects were used to explore the impact of climate on water balance, with all other factors held constant, including the soil. An east\u2013west transect at approximately latitude 33\u00b0S demonstrates the primary effect of annual average rainfall ranging from 300 to 850 mm. A north\u2013south transect along approximately the 600 mm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17027726238289514398", "cites_id": ["17027726238289514398"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030102001028", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nk_YBcyiTuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 10, "2007": 12, "2008": 7, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 3}}
