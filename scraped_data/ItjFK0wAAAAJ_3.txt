The focus of this paper is the predictive performance of APSIM for simulation of soil water and nitrate nitrogen in contrasting soils (vertisols and alfisols) and environments. The three APSIM modules that determine the dynamics of water, carbon, and nitrogen in the soil system (viz. SOILWAT, SOILN and RESIDUE v.1) are described in terms of the processes represented, with particular emphasis on aspects of their coding that differ from their precursors in CERES and PERFECT. The most fundamental change is in SOILN, which now provides a formal balance of both carbon and nitrogen in the soil and includes a labile soil organic matter pool that decomposes more rapidly than the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 693, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11410711136905295688", "cites_id": ["11410711136905295688"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X97000280", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SHfVjVL9Wp4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 12, "1999": 10, "2000": 13, "2001": 29, "2002": 18, "2003": 20, "2004": 21, "2005": 14, "2006": 19, "2007": 28, "2008": 23, "2009": 22, "2010": 25, "2011": 30, "2012": 25, "2013": 33, "2014": 34, "2015": 25, "2016": 45, "2017": 41, "2018": 39, "2019": 29, "2020": 41, "2021": 35, "2022": 34, "2023": 16}}
