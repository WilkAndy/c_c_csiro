CAB Internatinal, Wallingford", "abstract": "Supply of nitrogen (N) to a crop involves many complex states, \ufb02ows and regulatory processes, most of which are strongly influenced by climate and management. Rainfall (generally the lack of it) exerts a dominant in\ufb02uence on the N economy of cereal cropping systems in semiarid regions. The combination of a complex system with many interactions, operating under a highly variable rainfall regime, requires models to deal with this complexity and variability. This paper brie\ufb02y reviews the modelling approaches taken to the study of N fertiliser use on crops, and proceeds to use a simulation study involving maize production in semiarid Kenya to highlight some principles and possibilities. The CERES-maize model was tested and a revised version (CM-KEN) was found to provide accurate predictions of grain yield under a wide range of water, N and management regimes. This model was then used in conjunction with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3624362276124829314", "cites_id": ["3624362276124829314"], "pub_url": "http://www.bob-mccown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Keating-et-al1991OptimisingN_inputs.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gia_lUlSTDIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 8, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 6, "1998": 10, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 0, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 5, "2009": 0, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
