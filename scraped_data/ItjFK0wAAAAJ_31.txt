This work examined, for maize, the relationship between the fully expanded area-per and leaf position, in an attempt to identify appropriate functions for use in such models. The slightly skewed bell-shaped function of the form LA n= Y 0\u2217 exp (a\u2217(xn\u2212 X 0) 2+ b\u2217(xn\u2212 X 0) 3), was used to relate area-per-leaf (LA n) to leaf position (xn). The amplitude of the curve (Y 0) represents the size of the largest leaf (at position X 0). Plants varied in total leaf number (TLNO) from 12 to 17 and this variation had a major bearing on the total leaf area per plant (TLA). Both Y 0 and X 0 were linearly related to TLNO (r 2 of 0.94 and 0.99 respectively). The parameter which controls the width of the bell-shaped curve (a), was non-linearly related to TLNO (r 2= 0.99), while the parameter that controls the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3723116889767272639", "cites_id": ["3723116889767272639"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037842909290085N", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v-DV1xUrqzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 5, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
