A crop simulation model (apsim\u2013nwheat) was used to evaluate the role of these traits in improving potential yield under a range of environmental conditions. apsim\u2013nwheat calculates the potential yield for a specific environment limited only by temperature, solar radiation, water and nitrogen supply. The model predicted crop production, soil water and N dynamics for low and high-yielding environments in Australia, The Netherlands and China. Applying the model to the various traits showed that a 20% increase in kernel number, early anthesis and a 20% increase in kernel filling rate had no or only minor effects on increasing potential yield in high- and extremely high-yielding environments. In these environments, when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1635152961384922053", "cites_id": ["1635152961384922053"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030101001496", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xbvGePQ6sRYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
