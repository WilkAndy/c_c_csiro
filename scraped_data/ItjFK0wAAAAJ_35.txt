Contrasting patterns of water use indicate pronounced physiological activity in summer by natural ecosystems ensuring the persistence of the dominant perennial species. A strategy of tempered water use during periods of rainfall excess in winter/spring enables seasonal carryover of soil water to be withdrawn by deep roots for summer functioning. Characteristic patterns of water use by agricultural systems, comprised mainly of determinant annual species, are truncated in time but feature elevated peak rates coinciding with periods of maximum soil water availability during the cooler months. Low seasonal vapour pressure deficit explains the observed benefits of enhanced biomass production due to high water use efficiency \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3955021364831511596", "cites_id": ["3955021364831511596"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/8c1062e9c473afc4271ad7d7d0061278/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=54133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LOTcCfoO4zYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 9, "2002": 8, "2003": 13, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
