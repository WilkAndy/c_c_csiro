This requires a sound understanding of crop physiological processes and well tested simulation models. Thus, this experiment on spring wheat aimed to better quantify water \u00d7 nitrogen effects on wheat by deriving some key crop physiological parameters that have proven useful in simulating crop growth. For spring wheat grown in Northern Australia under four levels of nitrogen (0 to 360 kg N ha\u22121) and either entirely on stored soil moisture or under full irrigation, kernel yields ranged from 343 to 719 g m\u22122. Yield increases were strongly associated with increases in kernel number (9150\u201319950 kernels m\u22122), indicating the sensitivity of this parameter to water and N availability. Total water extraction under a rain shelter was 240 mm with a maximum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=192375961194538471", "cites_id": ["192375961194538471"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378519X97800128", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5yVT3up0qwIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 11, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
