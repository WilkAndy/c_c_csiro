The incentive to plant trees would increase if tree competition could be offset by economic returns gained from farm forestry products and by the beneficial impacts of tree windbreaks on crop yields and resource sustainability. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) has a well-established capability to simulate cropping systems and this paper reports on progress in applying APSIM to agroforestry systems in order to quantify the potential benefits and risks of planting trees as windbreaks to cropping land in Australia. A simple case study indicating one possible model configuration is used to demonstrate this emergent capability for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14432592210058960648", "cites_id": ["14432592210058960648"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S116103010200103X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CF-i3CXeSsgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 10, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
