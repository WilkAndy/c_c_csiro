These models not only operationalise our basic physiology understanding but also serve to identify knowledge gaps and priority research areas. This paper explores the integration between basic field research, model development and application and on-ground impact. It explores the historical mutual dependency between basic sugarcane physiology research and model development through a brief summary of the key sugarcane models and the seminal published field and controlled-environment studies on which they are based. Examples are given of applications of this understanding and modelling capability that have led to, or have the potential to lead to, significant impacts on sugarcane farming system design, practice and policy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2585888778956714401", "cites_id": ["2585888778956714401"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429005000390", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oTFi0iTs4iMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 6, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 12, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
