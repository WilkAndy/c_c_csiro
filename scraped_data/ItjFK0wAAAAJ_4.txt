The rich history of this science exemplifies the diversity of systems and scales over which they operate and have been studied. Modeling, an essential tool in agricultural systems science, has been accomplished by scientists from a wide range of disciplines, who have contributed concepts and tools over more than six decades. As agricultural scientists now consider the \u201cnext generation\u201d models, data, and knowledge products needed to meet the increasingly complex systems problems faced by society, it is important to take stock of this history and its lessons to ensure that we avoid re-invention and strive to consider all dimensions of associated challenges. To this end, we summarize here the history of agricultural systems modeling and identify lessons learned that can \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C", "num_citations": 608, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16748108143488903154", "cites_id": ["16748108143488903154"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X16301585", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8qd7CJ87begJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 27, "2018": 64, "2019": 98, "2020": 127, "2021": 133, "2022": 110, "2023": 43}}
