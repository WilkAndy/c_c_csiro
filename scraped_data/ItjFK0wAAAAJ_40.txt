Queensland, Australia under favourable moisture and nutritional conditions. The extent and timing of storage root initiation was relatively unaffected by the different temperature, solar radiation and photoperiod conditions associated with the different planting dates. Likewise, main stem and lateral branch number showed little variation either between planting dates or with time in any one planting. The time to first flowering and forking was substantially reduced for mid-summer planting dates, an effect being most likely related to the longer photoperiods of these months.Canopy development was also highly seasonal with leaf area indices ranging from above 10.0 in March and April for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15266688548530929099", "cites_id": ["15266688548530929099"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378429082900302", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y721N1ks3tMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 3, "1986": 0, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 3, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
