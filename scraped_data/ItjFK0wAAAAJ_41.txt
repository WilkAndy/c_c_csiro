They have a place in integrating nutrient information with information on other factors which affect yield and its response to added nutrients. This review deals with nitrogen models classified into three groups: those which predict yield-response curves based on empirical factors; those which simulate the yield response from complex simulation models of many processes regulating crop growth and the soil environment; and those which aim to simulate yield and selected processes based on simplified functional relationships which apply to a target region or industry. Three case studies representing the three classes of model are drawn from research on dryland wheat in different parts of Australia. They show examples in which models provide information which is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14362500024268416564", "cites_id": ["14362500024268416564"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00024984", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NOYOIa3ZUccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 8, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
