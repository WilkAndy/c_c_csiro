The module\u2019s early development was strongly influenced by the approaches used in CERES Wheat, but substantial changes have been made as the module was developed and used in wheat production environments in north-east Australia. NWheat simulates wheat phenology, leaf area development, light interception, biomass production and distribution within plant organs, yield development including retranslocation of pre-anthesis assimilate to grain, root system development, water use, nitrogen uptake and distribution in the plant, and senescence of plant parts. NWheat makes use of soil water, soil nitrogen, residue, management and other input and output modules within the APSIM simulation framework. This report outlines the approaches used within NWheat to simulate these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4059516082699711741", "cites_id": ["4059516082699711741"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:569fa894-16e2-4a7f-bf21-839c56220ab7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_TRNdV5MVjgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
