We used an integrated systems modelling approach to explore the response of Australian land use and agricultural production to these changes from 2013 to 2050. We found potentially large transitions in spatial and temporal patterns of land use, agricultural production, output rates, and profitability. New land uses such as carbon plantings, biofuels and bioenergy, and environmental plantings competed with food and fibre production, reducing its area. Global outlooks, including the strength of action on climate change and population assumptions, had a strong influence. Capacity constraints and adoption inertia reduced and delayed land \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10081059694345345157", "cites_id": ["10081059694345345157"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X15300482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hVj2WGEe54sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 14, "2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 15, "2023": 12}}
