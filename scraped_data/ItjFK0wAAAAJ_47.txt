The minimum temperature for sprouting and sprout elongation lay between 12 and 17\u00b0C, whilst the maximum was between 36 and 40\u00b0C. The optimum temperature for sprouting was 28.5\u00b0Cfor the cultivar MAus 7 and 30\u00b0C for the cultivar MAus 10. There was no significant difference between constant and alternating temperatures below the optimum.Whilst the rate of sprout elongation versus temperature response curve was shown to be quadratic over a wide temperature range, it was linear over the range of temperatures normally experienced in the field. Linear heat units or growing day degrees calculated from the laboratory incubator studies were shown to be useful in prediction of field emergence rates. Approximately 210 growing day degrees above a base of 13\u00b0C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7896907167039935276", "cites_id": ["7896907167039935276"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378429079900261", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LNOmkzpzl20J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
