Constraints are emerging in terms of land and water resources as well as imperatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is evidence that rates of increase in agricultural productivity are reducing, both in Australia and overseas. On top of all these drivers of change, agriculture is the sector probably most exposed to climate change, and Australian agriculture is as exposed as any in the world.      Against this turbulent background, this paper explores some of the emerging opportunities and challenges in Australian agriculture. These include new products or services from agriculture such as biofuels, forest-based carbon storage in agricultural landscapes, bio-sequestration of carbon in agricultural soils, and environmental stewardship \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5655333731473571230", "cites_id": ["5655333731473571230"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/CP09282", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nj3ExhDIe04J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
