Traditional agricultural experimentation has examined fixed strategies of fertilizer management, but farmers frequently make tactical adjustments to their management in the light of what they perceive as information relevant to the prospects for the forthcoming crop. In this paper, we use a crop simulation model to examine the value of changing N fertilizer application rates in line with predictions of likely response to fertilizer based on the date of season onset. The analysis, using the CERES-Maize model, is centred on maize production in Machakos, a semi-arid district in eastern Kenya.The timing of sowing relative to defined onset criteria was examined, and the value of minimizing delays in sowing after onset quantified.
