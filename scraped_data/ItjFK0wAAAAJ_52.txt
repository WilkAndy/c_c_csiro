The work focused on the grain production region of northeast Australia as a case study and used the crop-soil management simulator, APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator). Wheat and sorghum production was simulated for a range of cropping systems and locations and the results averaged as a notional per unit area \u2018farm production\u2019. Moving averages over time bases from 1 to 4 years were used to examine variability and drought occurrence. Droughts over different time periods were identified in absolute terms (e.g. simulated production relative to a median or some lower percentile) or in probabilistic terms (e.g. the estimated recurrence interval or odds of experiencing a worse drought).
