Extrapolation may involve simulation of the expected behaviour for different climate and/or soil conditions, perhaps with alternative management, or for a longer time scale than observed experimentally. The issues to be addressed include those concerned with crop growth and profitability, effects on the soil resource, and consequences for the environment. The extent to which the model output is credible depends on how well the model represents those aspects of the system that are important for a particular application. In principle, any model can be enhanced to deal with additional factors, but more complex models become increasingly hungry for inputs, and increasingly difficult to test against actual data. There are judgements to be made as to whether the demands of model building/testing can be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9342730944410092105", "cites_id": ["9342730944410092105"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880900002310", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SQKdRUsMqIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
