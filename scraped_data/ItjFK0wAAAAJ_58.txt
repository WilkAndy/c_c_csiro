Queensland (latitude 27\u00b0 37\u2032S), Australia.Seasonal differences in the proportion of total dry matter assimilation partitioned to storage organs over a given time period (referred to as distribution ratio, DR) were observed with low DR over the mid-summer (January to March) period (0.1 to 0.3) when crop growth rate (CGR) was at a maximum compared with 0.4 to 0.5 in November to December and 0.5 to 1.0 in late autumn to winter (April to July). This period of low DR restricted storage organ yields which were generally lower (6\u20139 t DW ha\u22121 year\u22121) than those reported for adapted germplasm at lower latitudes.Multiple regression models were developed which accounted for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3936162261212817787", "cites_id": ["3936162261212817787"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378429082900326", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e2njzbgOoDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 2}}
