M Aus 10) in S.E. Queensland, Australia (latitude 27\u00b0 37\u2032S) were used to examine the effect of environment on dry matter growth and biomass yield.Maximum crop growth rates (CGR) calculated from fitted logistic curves ranged from 23.8 to 2.4 g m\u22122 day\u22121 for the various planting dates and occurred in late summer to autumn, becoming progressively smaller and later for plantings made later in the growth season. Crop growth rate declined to zero or near zero for all planting dates in late winter. Maximum CGR's were higher than those reported for cassava at lower latitudes but, because of the restricted growing season, annual biomass yields from early planting times were similar and of the order of 30 t ha\u22121 year\u22121.Multiple regression models were developed which could account for 89% of the variation in CGR in terms of mean air temperature or solar radiation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6234186786575971504", "cites_id": ["6234186786575971504"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378429082900314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sHRLLdpHhFYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
