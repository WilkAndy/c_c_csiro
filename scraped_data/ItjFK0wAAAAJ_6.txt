A sugarcane crop model is described that can be deployed in the APSIM framework for agricultural systems simulation. The model operates on a daily time step, grows a leaf canopy, uses intercepted radiation to produce assimilate, and partitions this assimilate into leaf, structural stalk and sugar. The crop physiological processes represented in the model respond to the radiation and temperature environment and are sensitive to water and nitrogen supply. The model simulates growth, water use, N accumulation, sugar dry weight and fresh cane yield for plant and ratoon crops in response to climate, soil, management and genotypic factors. The model was developed on 35 datasets from Australia, Hawaii \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 410, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8062710544782097928", "cites_id": ["8062710544782097928"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429098001671", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CH6IvIWA5G8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 10, "2001": 13, "2002": 12, "2003": 10, "2004": 11, "2005": 15, "2006": 6, "2007": 15, "2008": 14, "2009": 15, "2010": 14, "2011": 15, "2012": 27, "2013": 19, "2014": 31, "2015": 18, "2016": 25, "2017": 17, "2018": 22, "2019": 28, "2020": 15, "2021": 30, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
