This review nominates the farming practices, and their development through investment in science and technology, that have helped sustain dryland farming systems in Australia. It sets the context for dryland agriculture in Australia and specifically examines the risks and returns from technological innovations over the past 30 years. It then examines possible sources of productivity gains in the next 20 years.Australian dryland farming systems have performed favourably compared to the agricultural sectors in most other countries over the past 30 years. Australian Research, Development and Extension (RD&E) has been a significant contributor to the realized agricultural productivity growth over this period. However, growth in the productivity of agriculture appears to have slowed down in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15473179225401707671", "cites_id": ["15473179225401707671"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-agricultural-science/article/innovation-and-productivity-in-dryland-agriculture-a-returnrisk-analysis-for-australia/CA08CA6429011B51438683F0EEE35E40", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l8wFbIbGu9YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
