Models that relate crop growth to climate, soil, genotype and management factors can assist in the evaluation of strategies for enhancing crop productivity under variable cIimates. To be it useful tool. a model needs to provide acceptably accurate estimates of crop growth and yield in relation to the major Factors which deterrni ne productivity. In this paper, We report on research carried out in semi-arid eastern Kenya over the period 1985-89, aimed at developing a capability to model maize growth and yield in relation to the major soil, management and elimatic constraints."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4840466429158697380", "cites_id": ["4840466429158697380"], "pub_url": "http://www.bob-mccown.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/K1_Keating-Wafulw-Watiki_Proc41.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pCk1SZLKLEMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
