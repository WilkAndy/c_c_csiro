Nevertheless, simulation models can compliment traditional field experimentation in researching alternative management options. The first objective of this paper is, therefore, to provide four case study examples of where models were used to help research issues relating to improved nutrient efficiency in low-input cropping systems. The first two cases addressed strategies of augmenting traditional farming practices with small applications of chemical fertilizer (N and P). The latter two cases explicitly addressed the question of what plant genetic traits can be beneficial in low-nutrient farming systems. In each of these case studies, the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17273607296274467922", "cites_id": ["17273607296274467922"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-1570-6_34", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UgwJBFEuuO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
