Daily output data from short-term model runs are used to demonstrate the capability of the model to represent the diverse management of sugarcane crops encountered in Australia. Output from longer term simulations is used to investigate a number of \u2018real life\u2019 sustainability issues, including an assessment of the production risk associated with season to season climate variability at each site, and the long-term implications of crop residue management on system performance. The paper also develops guidelines for methodological issues in long-term simulations of sugarcane production systems, relating to (1) the length of the climate record necessary to capture the \u2018true\u2019 season to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10002859382209011176", "cites_id": ["10002859382209011176"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429000001088", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6F3AVpxL0YoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
