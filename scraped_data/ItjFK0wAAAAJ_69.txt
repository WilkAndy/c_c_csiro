Rainfall is low and unreliable and crop failures are common. Crop models which simulate growth and yield in relation to weather, soil, management and genotype inputs are being investigated as tools to aid research in such areas where rainfall uncertainity dominates agricultural production. Our experience with the CERES Maize Model is considered in this paper and in particular its performance at simulating maize growth andyield under a wide range of plant populations.The model was tested against an independent data set comprising grain yields and above ground biomass for a short season maize cultivar grown over a population range of 8,000 to 90,000 plants ha'1. The model provided an accurate description of grain yield over this range under both water non-limiting and Water limiting situations. Simulation of above ground biomass was less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10155371783661615484", "cites_id": ["10155371783661615484"], "pub_url": "http://www.bob-mccown.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/56_KeatingEtAl1990SimnDensityEffectsMaize_H20_N.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fPks79Qg74wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
