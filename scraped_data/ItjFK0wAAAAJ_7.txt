The concept of eco\u2010efficiency encompasses both the ecological and economic dimensions of sustainable agriculture. Social and institutional dimensions of sustainability, while not explicitly captured in eco\u2010efficiency measures, remain critical barriers and opportunities on the pathway toward more eco\u2010efficient agriculture. This paper explores the multidimensionality of the eco\u2010efficiency concept as it applies to agriculture across diverse spatial and temporal scales, from cellular metabolisms through to crops, farms, regions, and ecosystems. These dimensions of eco\u2010efficiency are integrated through the presentation and exploration of a framework that explores an efficiency frontier between agricultural outputs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 406, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5412326328088541841", "cites_id": ["5412326328088541841"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2009.10.0594", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kTo2oh5yHEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 12, "2011": 19, "2012": 24, "2013": 39, "2014": 27, "2015": 33, "2016": 26, "2017": 38, "2018": 31, "2019": 38, "2020": 29, "2021": 35, "2022": 37, "2023": 11}}
