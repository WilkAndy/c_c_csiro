This drainage is believed to be contributing to watertable rise and salinity in some parts of the Liverpool Plains catchment in northern New South Wales. The effect of land use on deep drainage was investigated by comparing the traditional long fallow system with more intense \u2018opportunity cropping\u2019. Long fallowing (2 crops in 3 years) is used to store rainfall in the soil profile but risks substantial deep drainage. Opportunity cropping seeks to lessen this risk by sowing whenever there is sufficient soil moisture. Elements of the water balance and productivity were measured under various farming systems in a field experiment for 4 years in the southern part of the catchment. The experimental results were used to verify APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9383354970017875930", "cites_id": ["9383354970017875930"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR04303", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2sdPTaFfOIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
