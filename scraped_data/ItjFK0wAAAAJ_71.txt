Sweet sorghum grown and processed complementarily with sugarcane can potentially increase the efficiency of production by utilizing existing infrastructure to harvest, transport and extract fermentable sweet sorghum sugars. A study was conducted to observe sweet sorghum harvest, transport and crushing at Mossman Central Mill, Queensland, Australia, at the conclusion of the 2002 sugarcane crushing season. A 15-hectare sweet sorghum plant crop was harvested with a cane harvester in 2 separate batches; with the harvester's extractor fans operating and with the harvester's extractor fans turned off. Each batch was transported and crushed with the existing sugarcane infrastructure. The first ratoon of sweet sorghum was harvested with a forage harvester. The bulk density of forage-harvested sweet sorghum was approximately 400 kg/m 3 compared with approximately 300 kg/m 3 for sugarcane and 200 kg/m 3 for sweet sorghum harvested with a cane harvester. The higher bulk density material was cheaper to transport, placing limits on the geographical area in which cane-harvested sweet sorghum could be sourced. A deterioration analysis showed a slight reduction in juice extraction percentage and no reduction in brix of extracted juice of cane-harvested sweet sorghum. Brix declined rapidly in forage-harvested sweet sorghum over the first 42 hours after harvest. Juice extraction percentage exhibited a similar trend to cane-harvested sweet sorghum. There were significant cut-to-crush limitations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8424851926437049109", "cites_id": ["8424851926437049109"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043079920", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FbOLuDAW63QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 2}}
