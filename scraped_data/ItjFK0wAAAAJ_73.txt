The consequence for market stability was severe, with significant impacts on human welfare as extra millions joined the ranks of the undernourished (FAO, 2009). The forces that shaped this food crisis have been well analysed (FAO, 2009, Headey and Fan, 2008). In summary, a combination of poor seasons in some regions, high energy and input prices, a sustained period of high economic growth and diet shifts driving stronger demand growth particularly in Asia, low global food stocks and a rapid expansion of grains and oils to biofuel use came together in the \u201cperfect storm\u201d to drive a spike in food prices.
