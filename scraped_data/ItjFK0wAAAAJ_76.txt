Field experimentation aimed at optimising management strategies and evaluating technical innovations has been hampered by the highly variable climate of the region. In addition, the potential for multiple interactions between management, soil and climate variables has limited the value of experiments dealing with only single factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5171727777142269949", "cites_id": ["5171727777142269949"], "pub_url": "https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/legacy/node/2274/pr41_pdf_20252.pdf#page=91", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_eeVJwOrxUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
