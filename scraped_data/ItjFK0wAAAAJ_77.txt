The main interest lies in the use of storage roots as an alternative starch source to cereals and as a feedstock in the production of alcohol as a liquid fuel. The work reported here was aimed at developing an understanding of environmental effects on growth and development of cassava, as a pre-requisite to the delineation of suitable growing areas and to the development of efficient agronomic practices and yield improvement programs.Patterns of growth and development of the cultivar MAUS10 planted at twelve monthly intervals were studied under non-limiting moisture and nutritional conditions at Redland Bay (lat. 27o37'S, long. 153o17'E). The choice of this relatively high latitude site made it possible to examine growth and development under a broad range of seasonal conditions. Sequential harvests carried out at 45 day intervals, over a one \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16056409871289272458", "cites_id": ["16056409871289272458"], "pub_url": "https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:413265", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ishFGrXT094J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
