Farmers in many catchments are turning to on-farm water storages (OFWSs) as a means of capturing as much water as they can and to provide them with increased options for managing limited water supplies. The decision to invest in such storages is complex and multi-faceted, requiring assessment of a range of biophysical, economic, legislative and social factors. Computer-based simulation models can capture many of these factors and their interactions and, hence, can play a useful decision support role. In this paper, we describe a software package (Dam Ea$y) that couples biophysical and economic modelling tools, in a way that enables analysis of the likely costs and benefits of various scenarios \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4363692821341799030", "cites_id": ["4363692821341799030"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X02001129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dgIATYDzjjwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1}}
