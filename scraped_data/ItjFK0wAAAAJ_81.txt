Proceedings of the 9th Australian Society of Agronomy Conference", "abstract": "Comprehensive agricultural systems simulation tools such as APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) can be effectively used in studying the behaviour of agricultural systems in response to alternative management strategies. This is illustrated using hypothetical long-term simulations for a sugarcane system in Bundaberg. The simulations, which focus on nitrate leaching, show that there are significant year-to-year carry-over effects and suggest some management principles that could potentially reduce the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate leaching."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6897134352766120147", "cites_id": ["6897134352766120147"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1998/8/235verburg.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:07DEuCaLt18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
