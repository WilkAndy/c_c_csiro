Many efforts are now directed at analysing the current food demand and supply scenarios and food price volatility (von Braun and Ahmed 2008; FAO et al. 2011) and exploring future scenarios of food demand and supply to 2050 (Agrimonde 2010; Hubert et al. 2010; Keating and Carberry 2010; Foresight 2011)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8154347536638082495", "cites_id": ["8154347536638082495"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203114742-9/agricultural-intensi%EF%AC%81cation-food-security-challenge-sub-saharan-africa-keating-carberry-dixon", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v_1kiOEPKnEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
