In addition, knowledge on crop water requirements is needed to guide water allocation and costing policies for the expanding Ord Irrigation Area where sugarcane is likely to be a dominant crop. Field data indicating water requirements for sugar in the Ord Irrigation Area are few and this paper deploys a modelling approach to extrapolate from knowledge of water requirements in other parts of the world. The approach links long-term climatic data with soil water characteristics of the main soil type, with a cropping systems model, to develop indicative estimates of irrigation water requirement and yield consequences for different management options for sugarcane production in the Ord. Analyses of the growth of 12-month old ratoon crops were conducted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5335681948416906748", "cites_id": ["5335681948416906748"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/AN/EA98023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_JXaYXYmDEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
