It gives brief descriptions of the models that are currently available in Australia and that are of interest in modelling net ecosystem exchange for the Australian continent: APSIM, CENTURY, CenW, FullCAM, G\u2019DAY, Gendec, GrazPlan, GRASP, Linkages, Promod, Roth-C, Socrates and 3-PG.These models deal with the range of different ecosystems that together constitute the Australian biosphere. Some ecosystems or components of ecosystems are modelled by more than one model, but the different models approach their modelling tasks in different ways by providing more or less detail, and by including or omitting certain processes or plant or soil pools."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11510489023829054136", "cites_id": ["11510489023829054136"], "pub_url": "https://www.kirschbaum.id.au/ModelDescriptions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uBJdMMh4vZ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
