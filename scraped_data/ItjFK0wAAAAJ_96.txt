Pure swards of some annual and perennial species (i.e. Macroptilium atropurpureum cv. Siratro, Macroptilium lathyroides cv. Murray, Stylosanthes scabra CPI 55856 and Rhynchosia minima CQ2970) were found to be productive (rainfed, 2-3 t ha-1, irrigated, 4-6 t ha-1) over 3 years. A moderately severe summer drought (to be expected on a 1 in 6 frequency), while severely limiting DM production relative to irrigated plots, did not adversely affect plant survival or regeneration in the following season. Waterlogging associated with normally high autumn and winter rainfall did prevent perennation, but regeneration from soil seed reserves was excellent and sward survival was not affected (4 t ha-1 after 3 years). The soil studied has a moderate level of subsoil salinity (EC, of 3.6 dS m-1 at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8742471158768170995", "cites_id": ["8742471158768170995"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/an/ea9870633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:83d5BTN_U3kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 4, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
