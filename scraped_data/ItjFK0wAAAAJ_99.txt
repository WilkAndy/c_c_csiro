It is based on Australia\u2019s contribution to the United Kingdom (UK) Government\u2019s Foresight project on Global Food and Farming Futures, whose findings are due to be launched in November 2010.The Foresight Programme is run by the UK Government Office for Science. Individual Foresight projects look at least 10 years ahead, develop visions of the future and analyse issues at the interface of science and society. Cutting-edge science and other evidence are used to identify future risks and opportunities, and inform strategies to manage those challenges. The Foresight project on Global Food and Farming Futures seeks to answer the following question:\u2018how can a future global population of nine billion people all be fed healthily and sustainably?\u2019. The project looks out to 2050 and takes a global view of the food system, considering issues of demand, production and supply as well as broader environmental issues. Because of the project\u2019s global perspective, the work draws heavily on the skills and perspectives of leading experts and stakeholders from around the world, including Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "ItjFK0wAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17229414152134881881", "cites_id": ["17229414152134881881"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/2yi4jmhbwnfyxkncyior6xqaku/access/wayback/http://data.daff.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99000001/techInnoDrylandAgAus201007.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WXIW0uIsG-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
