Our aim was to focus on the relationship between genetic effective and census size that may provide a source of information for viability analyses of naturally occurring populations. Samples were taken in 2001, 2002 and 2003 from a population on the east coast of Australia and temporal allelic variation was measured at eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. Moments\u2010based and maximum\u2010likelihood estimates of current genetic effective population size ranged from 797 to 1304. The mean long\u2010term genetic effective population size was 9968. Although small for a large population, the effective population size estimates were above the threshold where \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11888626279277310410", "cites_id": ["11888626279277310410"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03132.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yrGyw5zi_KQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 18, "2013": 21, "2014": 20, "2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
