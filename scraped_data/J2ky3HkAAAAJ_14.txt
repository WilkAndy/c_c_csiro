Two methods of estimation of the standard errors are considered: the standard informationbased method and the computationally-intensive bootstrap method. They are compared empirically by their application to three real data sets and by a small-scale Monte Carlo experiment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12161483160715741112", "cites_id": ["12161483160715741112"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G-Mclachlan/publication/37625647_Standard_errors_of_fitted_component_means_of_normal_mixtures/links/09e4150c54f951e160000000/Standard-errors-of-fitted-component-means-of-normal-mixtures.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uEdbGIBExqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 13, "2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
