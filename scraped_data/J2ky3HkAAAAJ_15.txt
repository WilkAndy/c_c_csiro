To identify joint sets present in the rock mass, the orientation of individual fracture planes can be measured on exposed rock faces and the resulting data can be examined for heterogeneity. In this article, the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm is used to fit mixtures of Kent component distributions to the fracture data to aid in the identification of joint sets. An additional uniform component is also included in the model to accommodate the noise present in the data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3086389408811582929", "cites_id": ["3086389408811582929"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214501750332974", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0QW-ntAO1SoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 10, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
