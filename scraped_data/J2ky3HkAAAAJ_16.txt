Researchers can deal with missing data by removing individuals that have failed to yield genotypes and/or by removing loci that have failed to yield allelic determinations, but despite their best efforts, most data sets still contain some missing data. As a consequence, realized sample size differs among loci, and this poses a problem for unbiased methods that must explicitly account for random sampling error. One commonly used solution for the calculation of contemporary effective population size (Ne) is to calculate the effective sample size as an unweighted mean or harmonic mean across loci. This is not ideal because it fails to account for the fact that loci with different numbers of alleles have different information content. Here we consider this problem for genetic estimators of contemporary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16319799733505158103", "cites_id": ["16319799733505158103"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.12049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1-sWQWSTe-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
