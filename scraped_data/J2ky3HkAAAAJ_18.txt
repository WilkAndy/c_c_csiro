An added benefit of these systems is that they collect a large amount of data on vessel locations at very fine spatial and temporal scales. This data can provide a wealth of information for stock assessment, research, and management. However, since most VMS implementations record vessel location at set time intervals with no regard to vessel activity, some methodology is required to determine which data records correspond to fishing activity. This paper describes a probabilistic approach, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), to determine vessel activity. A HMM provides a natural framework for the problem and, by definition, models the intrinsic temporal correlation of the data. The paper describes the general approach that was developed and presents an example of this approach applied to the Queensland \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14263978133951856774", "cites_id": ["14263978133951856774"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f2011-055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hsAj_onU88UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
