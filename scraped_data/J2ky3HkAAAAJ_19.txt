While annual systematic surveys around Antarctica from 1978 to 2009 recorded only 216 visual encounters of this species, their loud and distinctive calls were detected frequently throughout the Southern Ocean. We describe and assess a new method for locating these whales by acoustically detecting their vocalisations, tracking the location of their calls, and finally locating the whales visually. This methodology was employed during an Antarctic research voyage from 140 E to 170 W, between January and March 2013. The loudest song unit (a 26 Hz tone) was detected at all 298 recording sites south of 52 S. Acoustically derived bearings from these whales enabled visual observers to eventually sight the whales, often \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4697477413563631410", "cites_id": ["4697477413563631410"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v26/n3/p257-269/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Mofhv9HKMEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
