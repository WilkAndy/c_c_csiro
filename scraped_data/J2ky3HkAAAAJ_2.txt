NeEstimator v2 includes three single\u2010sample estimators (updated versions of the linkage disequilibrium and heterozygote\u2010excess methods, and a new method based on molecular coancestry), as well as the two\u2010sample (moment\u2010based temporal) method. New features include the following: (i) an improved method for accounting for missing data; (ii) options for screening out rare alleles; (iii) confidence intervals for all methods; (iv) the ability to analyse data sets with large numbers of genetic markers (10 000 or more); (v) options for batch processing large numbers of different data sets, which will facilitate cross\u2010method comparisons using simulated data; and (vi) correction for temporal estimates when individuals \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 1863, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3144919700605421464", "cites_id": ["3144919700605421464"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1755-0998.12157", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mMe2Ic7_pCsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 45, "2015": 126, "2016": 161, "2017": 175, "2018": 217, "2019": 230, "2020": 205, "2021": 296, "2022": 262, "2023": 133}}
