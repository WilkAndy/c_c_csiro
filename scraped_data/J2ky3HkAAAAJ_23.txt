This is often the case in fisheries with historical catch and effort data. Compared to conventional stratified design or design-based designs, our model-based designs can be both efficient and flexible, for example in allowing uneven sampling due to survey logistics, and providing a general framework to answer specific design questions. As an example, we describe the design and preliminary implementation of a trawl survey for eleven fish species along the continental slope off South-East Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9317033997120625068", "cites_id": ["9317033997120625068"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-012-0114-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rNmcfg7BTIEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
