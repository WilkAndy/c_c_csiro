Jeju Island, Republic of Korea", "abstract": "The ultimate objective of the Antarctic Blue Whale Project (an initiative of the Southern Ocean Research Partnership (SORP) is to estimate the circumpolar abundance of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia). A mark-recapture approach can deliver a precise estimate with reasonable effort if the sighting rate of blue whales can be elevated relative to line-transect surveys using passive acoustic methods. The Australian Government chartered the 65-m FV Amaltal Explorer to conduct a 47-day voyage to Antarctic waters focussing on an area south of 60oS between 135 E and 170 W. An acoustic tracking system using DIFAR sonobuoys operated continuously during the voyages recording 626 hours of audio, while acousticians processed 26,545 Antarctic blue whale calls all in \u2018real-time\u2019. During the voyage 51 groups of vocalising blue whales were acoustically \u2018targeted\u2019which led to 33 visual sightings of groups of one or more whales. Photograph-identification data were collected for 50 individuals (33 left flank; 44 right flank; 33 left and right flanks) from 33 groups. The 23 biopsy samples collected showed a strong male bias (0.79) although some samples may be duplicates. Two satellite tags were deployed on Antarctic blue whales; this has not been achieved previously. This voyage has shown that acoustic tracking can increase the sightings rate of blue whales and should be employed on future voyages contributing to the Antarctic Blue Whale Project."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8756028175766437013", "cites_id": ["8756028175766437013"], "pub_url": "https://public.services.aad.gov.au/datasets/science/AAS_4102_Visobs2013/SC-65a-SH21-Double.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lbzeAzypg3kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
