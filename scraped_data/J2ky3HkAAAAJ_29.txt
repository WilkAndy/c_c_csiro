The multiple-use Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) has recently experienced substantial increases in current and proposed port expansions and subsequent shipping. Globally, large whale populations are recovering from commercial whaling and ship strike is a significant threat to some populations and a potential welfare issue for others. Within the GBRMP, there is spatial conflict between the main breeding ground of the east Australian humpback whale population and the main inner shipping route that services several large natural resource export ports. The east coast humpback whale population is one of the largest humpback whale populations globally, exponentially increasing (11% per annum) close to the maximum potential rate and estimated to reach pre-exploitation population numbers in the next 4\u20135 years. We quantify the relative risk of ship strike to calving and mating humpback whales, with areas of highest relative risk coinciding with areas offshore of two major natural resource export ports. We found females with a dependent calf had a higher risk of ship strike compared to groups without a calf when standardized for group size and their inshore movement and coastal dependence later in the breeding season increases their overlap with shipping, although their lower relative abundance decreases risk. The formalization of a two-way shipping route has provided little change to risk and projected risk \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15193232660347074683", "cites_id": ["15193232660347074683"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00067/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e7jZfZs02dIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
