However, for a set of data containing a group or groups of observations with longer than normal tails or atypical observations, the use of normal components may unduly affect the fit of the mixture model. In this paper, we consider a more robust approach by modelling the data by a mixture of t distributions. The use of the ECM algorithm to fit this t mixture model is described and examples of its use are given in the context of clustering multivariate data in the presence of atypical observations in the form of background noise."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 1085, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3889995576520047328", "cites_id": ["3889995576520047328"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008981510081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4HpR5F0K_DUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 8, "2004": 18, "2005": 19, "2006": 25, "2007": 27, "2008": 30, "2009": 38, "2010": 46, "2011": 27, "2012": 51, "2013": 63, "2014": 65, "2015": 59, "2016": 86, "2017": 71, "2018": 70, "2019": 76, "2020": 83, "2021": 73, "2022": 94, "2023": 39}}
