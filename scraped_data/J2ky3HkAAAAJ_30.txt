The diffusion and perfusion images are processed to extract region (s) of interest presenting tissue at risk of infarction. A midplane algorithm is also used to calculate ratio and diffusion and perfusion measures for modelling infarct evolution. A parametric normal classifier algorithm is used to predict infarct growth using the calculated measures."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2570028317425446906", "cites_id": ["2570028317425446906"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040106864A1/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-q_WWiOTqiMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
