In the case of rare and cryptic species, especially in remote locations, surveys can be difficult and expensive, and run the risk of not producing sample sizes large enough to produce precise estimates. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct preliminary analysis to determine if the study will produce useable estimates. The focus of this paper is a proposed mark\u2013recapture study of Antarctic blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus intermedia). Antarctic blue whales were hunted to near extinction up until the mid\u20101960s, when commercial exploitation of this species ended. Current abundance estimates are a decade old. Furthermore, at present, there are no formal circumpolar\u2010level cetacean surveys operating in Antarctic waters and, specifically, there is no strategy to monitor the potential recovery of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10105792394080068536", "cites_id": ["10105792394080068536"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/14-1169.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uKP8vqP8PowJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
