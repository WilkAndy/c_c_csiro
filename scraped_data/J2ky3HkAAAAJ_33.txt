Monitoring is a key requirement to determine if MPAs are meeting their objectives. However, many recently declared MPA\u2019s are large, offshore, or form part of an expansive network and spatial information about the habitats, communities and species that they contain is often lacking. This presents challenges for deciding exactly what to monitor and developing strategies on how to monitor it efficiently. Here we examine these issues using the Flinders Marine Park in Australia as a case study. We trial a two-stage version of a spatially-balanced, probabilistic sampling design combined with Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) to perform an initial inventory, and we evaluate the potential of six commercially and ecologically important \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2855895817766630052", "cites_id": ["2855895817766630052"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18301249", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pPKAdR0uoicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
