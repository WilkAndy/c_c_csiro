The number of components in this mixture model corresponds to the number of clusters to be imposed on the data. A common assumption is to take the component distributions to be multivariate normal with perhaps some restrictions on the component covariance matrices. The model can be tted to the data using maximum likelihood implemented via the EM algorithm. There is a number of computational issues associated with the tting, including the speci cation of initial starting points for the EM algorithm and the carrying out of tests for the number of components in the nal version of the model. We shall discuss some of these problems and describe an algorithm that attempts to handle them automatically.1. INTRODUCTION In some applications of mixture models, questions related to clustering may arise only after the mixture model has been tted. For instance, suppose that in the rst instance the reason for tting a mixture model was to obtain a satisfactory model for the distribution of the data. If this were achieved by the tting of, say, a three-component mixture model, then it may be of interest to consider the problem further to see if the three components can be identi ed with three externally existing groups, or if the clusters implied by the tted mixture model reveal the existence of previously unrecognized or unde ned subpopulations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7428251576211940460", "cites_id": ["7428251576211940460"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9bf0d144c9d9f37fc23a3acdb24264ba496dfb28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bCRZtnNzFmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
