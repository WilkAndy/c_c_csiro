However, limitations such as short flight endurance, and in many situations, aviation regulations, have constrained the use of small UAVs in survey applications. Thus, there is a need to refine survey methods adapted to small UAVs that conform to standard operations within aviation law. We developed a novel survey approach based on a grid sampling design using two multirotor UAVs (Phantom 4 Pros) flying simultaneously, within visual line of sight, from our vessel base-station. We used this approach to assess the fine-scale distribution and abundance of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in the remote waters of the Pilbara, Western Australia during three field seasons across two years. We surveyed 64 non-overlapping survey cells in random order one or more times and obtained complete image coverage of each surveyed cell of our 31 km2 survey area. Our sampling design maximises sampling effort while limiting survey time by surveying four cells, two at a time, from one location. Overall, we conducted 240 flights with up to 17 flights per day (mean = 14 flights per day) and could obtain complete coverage of up to 11.36 km2per day. A total of 149 dugongs were sighted within the 50,482 images which we manually reviewed. Spatially-explicit models of dugong density distribution (corrected for availability and perception bias) were produced using general additive models to identify areas more or less used by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9498281322229968749", "cites_id": ["9498281322229968749"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.640338/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ba8-3Ims0IMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
