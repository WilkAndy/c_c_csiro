Target Malaria used the risk assessment to support an application to import and rear these mosquitoes at the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sant\u00e9 insectary in Bobo-Dialousso, Burkina Faso.In November 2016, Target Malaria imported under permit Ag (DSM) 2 eggs into a contained facility within the insectary. The insectary backcrosses Ag (DSM) 2 females with male An. coluzzii mosquitoes born to gravid females originally sourced from a village in the Kou valley. The backcrossing replaces the genetic background of the original Ag (DSM) 2 eggs with that of the wild-type mosquitoes, designated here as Ac (WT). The trangenic mosquitoes are subsequently designated Ac (DSM) 2 to reflect the introgression of the Dominant Sterile Male construct into the An. coluzzii genetic background."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10310313563575436246", "cites_id": ["10310313563575436246"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith-Hayes/publication/327589979_Risk_Assessment_for_Controlling_Mosquito_Vectors_with_Engineered_Nucleases_Controlled_field_release_for_Sterile_Male_Construct/links/5b98672b299bf14ad4d09fe7/Risk-Assessment-for-Controlling-Mosquito-Vectors-with-Engineered-Nucleases-Controlled-field-release-for-Sterile-Male-Construct.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1kPOR4-XFY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
