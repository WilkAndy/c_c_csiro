The   latter is a nonstandard problem in parametric cluster analysis   because the dimension of the feature space (the number of genes) is   typically much greater than the number of tissues. A feasible   approach is provided by first selecting a subset of the genes   relevant for the clustering of the tissue samples by fitting   mixtures of tdistributions to rank the genes in order of   increasing size of the likelihood ratio statistic for the test of   one versus two components in the mixture model. The imposition of a   threshold on the likelihood ratio statistic used in conjunction with   a threshold on the size of a cluster allows the selection of a   relevant set of genes.
