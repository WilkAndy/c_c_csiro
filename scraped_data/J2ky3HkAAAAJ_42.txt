The International Roll Back Malaria partnership has pledged a goal to eradicate malaria worldwide by reducing the global incidence to zero. It is widely acknowledged that this goal will require new control methods.In February 2014, CSIRO was engaged by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) to conduct an independent assessment of the risks associated with an escape of mosquitoes genetically modified to be male-sterile by a construct that incorporates the I-PpoI Homing Endonuclease Gene (HEG). The male-sterile mosquitoes are the first stage in the development pathway of a new technology intended to provide a durable and cost-effective tool for reducing the burden of malaria in the Africa by reducing transmission of the malaria parasite."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18256229165229555061", "cites_id": ["18256229165229555061"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith-Hayes/publication/316065617_Risk_Assessment_for_Controlling_Mosquito_Vectors_with_Engineered_Nucleases_Sterile_Male_Construct/links/58eeabef458515c4aa52c9e1/Risk-Assessment-for-Controlling-Mosquito-Vectors-with-Engineered-Nucleases-Sterile-Male-Construct.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dT2iO7MnW_0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
