Finding loci is costly, but better loci reduce analysis costs and improve power. Optimal microsatellite panels minimize shadows, but panel design is a complex optimization process. locuseater and shadowboxer permit power and cost analysis of this process and automate some aspects, by simulating the entire experiment from panel design to harvest rate estimation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10813860341495795301", "cites_id": ["10813860341495795301"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2005.01116.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZY6Ksa-MEpYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
