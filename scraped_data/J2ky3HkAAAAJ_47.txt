Close to extinction, in 1964 the International Whaling Commission banned the hunting of blue whales, although they were still caught by illegal Soviet whaling operations until 1973. Last year, a paper was presented to the Scientific Committee that described a feasibility study of methods to obtain a new estimate of circumpolar abundance of Antarctic blue whales. Further to this we address issues and include improvements to this paper that were suggested during the 2011 meeting of the IWC Scientific Committee. We expand on previous work that demonstrated that a line-transect approach alone is not a realistic option to obtain a precise circumpolar abundance estimate of Antarctic blue whales. We use simulations to test a mark-recapture approach in tandem with techniques to boost encounter rates. These techniques include using the seasonality and location of historical sightings, acoustic detections, and catches to target \u2018hotspots\u2019 that may have higher densities of Antarctic blue whales. We also review recent developments in acoustic tracking that could yield increased encounter rates over visual survey alone. We demonstrate that in order to be viable, mark-recapture surveys should target alleged hotspots and make use of passive acoustic tracking to increase encounter rates. In light of all of these results, it appears that a series of markrecapture surveys could provide a viable estimate of abundance over the next decade."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3111630482201155723", "cites_id": ["3111630482201155723"], "pub_url": "https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/site/assets/files/1039/sc-64-sh10.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i5jg-2-7LisJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
