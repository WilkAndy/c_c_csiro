The survey was completed using a fixed-wing aircraft (a CASA-212 400) flying from a base at Casey station (66 17S, 110 32E). The survey was double-platform, with two observers on each side of the aircraft. To augment observer data, video, infrared and photographic equipment were placed in the bottom of the aircraft fuselage to record the presence of whales in the area under the aircraft inaccessible to the observers and also recorded sea ice information.The survey area was rectangular in shape with a northern extent along latitude of 64 47S down to the coast; a western boundary 105 52E longitude and an eastern boundary at 113 15E longitude; with a total area of 60,600 km2. Line transects were parallel at 10 nautical mile spacing and orientated north-south. Exceeding a planned total transect length of 3,000 km, the survey covered 6,293 km on effort (a number of transects were repeated) in 41 hours of flying (over nine days). Around 76 Antarctic minke whales were observed, in 53 sightings, with group size ranging from one to four. Using mark recapture distance sampling to estimate a detection function and a simple estimate of availability, a design-base estimate of minke whale abundance in the aerial survey area is 1,220 (CV= 0.18). This is a preliminary estimate, based on highly simplified estimation methods.
