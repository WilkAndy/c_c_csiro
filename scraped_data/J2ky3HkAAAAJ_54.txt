In each survey, a sector of up to about 60 longitudinal degrees was covered, with a northern survey boundary of up to 60 S and a southern boundary of the \u2018ice edge\u2019. The ice edge in this regard is not a glaciologically-defined ice edge, rather it is a logistical limit defining where the vessels could feasibly operate. The vessels used were not icebreakers and so had limited opportunity to survey within ice, but occasionally would be able to navigate through low ice concentrations (less than about one-tenth) in order to reach more readily surveyable open water, for example.In 2003/04, the third of three circumpolar sets of surveys (termed CPI, CPII and CPIII) was completed. The most current estimates of abundance of Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) from these surveys are 645,000 (cv= 0.143), 786,000 (cv= 0.094), and 338,000 (cv= 0.079) calculated using conventional line transect estimation methods\u2013ie assuming certain detectability of every whale pod on the vessels\u2019 tracklines (Branch, 2006b). Recognising the rather different operational procedures that were conducted during the CPI surveys, in recent years the Scientific Committee of the IWC has grappled with the issue of the appreciable decline in minke whale abundance estimates from CPII to CPIII, during which time any changes in survey procedures were not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1915041070348356513", "cites_id": ["1915041070348356513"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nat-Kelly/publication/265074403_Aerial_Survey_for_Minke_Whales_off_Eastern_Antarctica/links/54927ada0cf2ac83c53dc2c5/Aerial-Survey-for-Minke-Whales-off-Eastern-Antarctica.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:octlCLWXkxoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
