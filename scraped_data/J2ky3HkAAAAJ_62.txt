Subsequent abundance estimates derived from IDCR/SOWER line transect surveys between 1981 and 1998 provide low precision abundance estimates and suggest that the population is increasing, but remains less than 5% of their pre-exploitation abundance. Following the cessation of SOWER surveys in 2010 there is currently no strategy or means to obtain further abundance estimates for Antarctic blue whales but renewed effort could be conducted as a part of the multi-national, circumpolar Southern Ocean Research Partnership (SORP). Here, based on relatively simple calculations, we assess possible strategies for obtaining a new abundance estimate against the effort required and the likely precision of the estimates. We assessed three strategies (line-transect, mark recapture (MR), and hotspot-based MR). We found that to detect positive population growth from a new IDCR/SOWER type survey in 2013/14 with a power of 0.8 requires relatively little effort (2 to 4 vessel-seasons) because the new estimate can have relatively low precision (due to the trend provided by previous abundance estimates). To deliver a more precise abundance estimate (CV of 0.25 or lower), then the effort required from an IDCR/SOWER-type line-transect survey is approximately 9 vessel-seasons. A MR strategy (with structured, dedicated IDCR/SOWER vessel behaviour) required much greater effort (approximately 40 vessel-seasons) to deliver an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3567624315799256076", "cites_id": ["3567624315799256076"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/47157126/Strategies_to_obtain_a_new_abundance_est20160711-5930-12kkbbt.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DLxCw2m_gjEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
