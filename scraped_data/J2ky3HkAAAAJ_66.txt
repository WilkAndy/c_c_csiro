For independent observations, a normal mixture model can be tted by maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm. It leads to a probabilistic clustering of the data in terms of the tted posterior probabilities of component membership of the mixture model. The performance of this approach is compared to methods more closely related to neural networks. This comparison is undertaken over a set of benchmark data sets in the classi cation literature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3897128899764771372", "cites_id": ["3897128899764771372"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=a647a9b51f65f6ae69e5408841ea4637649a8493", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LFpjIhZiFTYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
