The aerial surveys were undertaken in the austral summers of 2008/09 and 2009/10. Our aerial survey programme is the first systematic survey of distribution and abundance of Antarctic minke whales in sea ice, both within and between summer seasons. During these surveys, around 15 000 km of effort was achieved across 20\u00ba of longitude (93-110\u00ba E), yielding 65 sightings of minke whales (94 individuals). We produced model-based estimates of uncorrected abundances and densities (uncorrected for availability bias) within sea ice between 93-110\u00baE, and we present discussion on the range of corrected estimates possible given our current lack of data on availability bias for Antarctic minke whales in sea ice regions. Using \u2018pro rated\u2019abundances from IDCR/SOWER, leveraged on simple estimates of encounter rate, there is some evidence that between 10 and 50% the minke population may have been within ice over those longitudes 93-113\u00baE during the 2009/10 summer. So we can conclude that the proportion of minke whales in ice regions is probably considerable, and will be an influence on biases on abundance estimates for open water regions. There is a clear need for more research to estimate availability bias in Antarctic minke whales."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11011749248047630696", "cites_id": ["11011749248047630696"], "pub_url": "https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/site/assets/files/1080/sc-65b-ia15.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aMmNLZmX0ZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
