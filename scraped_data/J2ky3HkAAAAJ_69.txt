Ship strike is a recognized global anthropogenic source of mortality or injury to large whales, and a potentially increasing risk in Australia. However, our understanding and evaluation of this threat to humpback whales around Australia, is hindered by the lack of seasonal whale distribution data in high marine traffic areas. Here, we present five consecutive years (2017\u20132021) of both north and south migrating humpback whale distribution data to quantify the relative risk of ship strike based on the co-occurrence with commercial ships in Moreton Bay. This marine embayment is home to Australia\u2019s fastest growing container port (The Port of Brisbane) and has recently been identified for its ecological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14972002682329304936", "cites_id": ["14972002682329304936"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X22003797", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aA9vUB09x88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
