This approach enables a normal mixture model to be fitted to a sample of n data points of dimension p, where p is large relative to n. The number of free parameters is controlled through the dimension of the latent factor space. By working in this reduced space, it allows a model for each component-covariance matrix with complexity lying between that of the isotropic and full covariance structure models. We shall illustrate the use of mixtures of factor analyzers in a practical example that considers the clustering of cell lines on the basis of gene expressions from microarray experiments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 296, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9349932081486300733", "cites_id": ["9349932081486300733"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947302001834", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PQYFp7ChwYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 11, "2007": 11, "2008": 16, "2009": 15, "2010": 19, "2011": 10, "2012": 21, "2013": 21, "2014": 21, "2015": 12, "2016": 17, "2017": 17, "2018": 20, "2019": 23, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 19, "2023": 4}}
