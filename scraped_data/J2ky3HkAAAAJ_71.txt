Our aerial survey programme is the first systematic survey of distribution and abundance of Antarctic minke whales in pack-ice, both within and between summer seasons. During these surveys, around 9 100 km of effort was achieved across 20\u00ba of longitude, yielding 76 sightings of minke whales (110 individuals). Model-based estimates of abundances were derived and used to make simple inferences about pack-ice habitat preferences for minke whales. These model-based estimates were also used to test the hypothesis that minke whales have moved into pack ice areas in substantial enough numbers to explain the decreases in abundance reported in the two current circumpolar abundance estimates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4827661907015158656", "cites_id": ["4827661907015158656"], "pub_url": "https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/site/assets/files/1080/sc-63-ia3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gMtSJ-1M_0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
