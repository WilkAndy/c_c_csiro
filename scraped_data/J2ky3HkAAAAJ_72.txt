This recent survey repeated a similar survey design (location and transect direction and spacing) to that of a smaller-scale aerial survey in the 2008/09 austral summer. In addition, the recent survey also extended effort both further west across pack-ice around the Shackleton Ice Shelf and Davis Sea and north of the ice edge and into open water. Both aerial surveys were double-platform and conducted using CASA-212 aircraft.A basic MRDS analysis yielded estimates of relative densities for areas within both aerial surveys. In the Vincennes Bay area, relative density of minke whales in December 2008 was around 10 times that of densities observed in December 2009. There was also an intra-season increase in relative density of minke whales in Vincennes Bay: estimated relative density of minke whales in the Vincennes Bay in late January-early February 2010 was 2-4 times higher than in December 2009 (based on point estimates). Densities of minke whales were higher in the north of the Davis Sea as compared to the south. It may be that pack-ice dynamics and the relative position of the shelf-break (krill habitat) are influencing inter-and intra-summer densities of minke whales across the aerial survey study area."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12007565763049561977", "cites_id": ["12007565763049561977"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/39208179/54e2b6340cf2966637973ccf.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eR-2U3Fxo6YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
