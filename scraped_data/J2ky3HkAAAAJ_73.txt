As in previous seasons, this aerial survey will be flown using fixed-wing CASA-212 aircraft and will be double-platform on each side of the aircraft. The survey has two aims: first, to test the hypothesis that Antarctic minke whales occur in significant numbers within sea ice inaccessible to research vessels; second, to provide data in order to model their distribution relative to sea ice habitat.It is planned that the 2009/10 aerial survey will be split into three phases in order to address a number of different hypotheses about the relationship of Antarctic minke whales and sea ice in east Antarctica; this survey will also span nearly 20 of longitude. The first phase, scheduled for December, 2009, will be a repeat of the aerial survey undertaken in Vincennes Bay December, 2008 (near 66 S 110 E) and will cover around 5,000 kilometres of transect effort. This first phase will allow a between-year comparison of whale abundance and distribution in the Vincennes Bay area. The second phase, scheduled from late December 2009 to mid-January, 2010, will shift survey effort north of the Shackleton Ice Shelf and into the eastern section Davis Sea (near 64 S 100 E) and will cover around 4,700 kilometres of transect effort. Historically, whale research voyages such as IDCR/SOWER have surveyed in this area but have not been able to access the Davis Sea or the polynyas that open up around the Shackleton Ice Shelf.
