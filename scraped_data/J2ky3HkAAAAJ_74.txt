The overall goal of this research program was to develop statistical methods and software that substantially enhances the utility and robustness of current survey methods. To achieve this, four research projects were undertaken, to develop methods for 1 analysis of towed passive acoustic and combined visual-acoustic surveys 2 improved modeling of animal distribution from survey data 3 improved modeling of spatial distribution of group size for animals that cluster and 4 more efficient survey designs that utilize information from the above models to direct sampling. Here, we report our findings, list the research outputs and give recommendations for future research directions.Descriptors:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2855844816853330701", "cites_id": ["2855844816853330701"], "pub_url": "https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA479648", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Desu4rr_oScJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
