Department of Primary Industries(Queensland)", "pages": "125", "abstract": "This project developed a user-friendly eel fishery management model so fisheries managers could investigate different management alternatives and the effects on trends in yield to the fishery and sustainable production of spawners. Ageing validation experiments on tank-held and tagged wild eels from sub-tropical Queensland (Australia) confirmed that they could be aged reliably. This enabled parameters of maturity, growth, mortality and age at recruitment to the fishery to be estimated and, with selectivity of the eel fishery and size at maturity data, they facilitated the development of an eel fishery management model. Current management arrangements will not alter substantially in New South Wales or Queensland and freshwater riverine areas will remain closed to fishing. Recommendations to management agencies include using long-term monitoring catch per unit effort (CPUE) data as an index of abundance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13435240891293847835", "cites_id": ["13435240891293847835"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13435240891293847835&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G1FfXWiQc7oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
