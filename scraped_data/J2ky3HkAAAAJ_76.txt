Estimate population parameters required for a management model. These include survival, density, age structure, growth, age and size at maturity and at recruitment to the adult eel fishery. Estimate their variability among individuals in a range of habitats. 2. Develop a management population dynamics model and use it to investigate management options. 3. Establish baseline data and sustainability indicators for long-term monitoring. 4. Assess the applicability of the above techniques to other eel fisheries in Australia, in collaboration with NSW. Distribute developed tools via the Australia and New Zealand Eel Reference Group."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14659881379967058876", "cites_id": ["14659881379967058876"], "pub_url": "http://era.daf.qld.gov.au/id/eprint/5047/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vMNMlnFccssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
