A common concern with genetic control methods is that transgenesis might somehow adversely alter the ability of genetically modified mosquitoes to transmit pathogens.The objective of this study is to develop a structured process for excluding or including, and subsequently prioritising, target and non-target pathogens for the purposes of scoping risk assessments for contained use or field releases in sub-Saharan Africa of genetically modified mosquitoes. The study distinguishes four categories of pathogens:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://fnih.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Pathogen_prioritisation_final_report_v6.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d8IZkaNpuHgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
