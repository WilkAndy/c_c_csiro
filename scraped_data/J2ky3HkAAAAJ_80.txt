A growing maritime economy in general and the construction and maintenance of offshore wind farms in particular will lead to further increases in ship traffic, including outside designated shipping lanes (Ecorys et al., 2012; Fridell et al., 2015; Bahlke, 2017; Matczak, 2018). Ship traffic is known to be associated with various negative environmental impacts as a result of emissions into the water and air (OSPAR, 2010; HELCOM, 2018). In addition, approaching vessels may present a threatening stimulus to marine birds, with subsequent riskavoidance behavior reducing the time available for other activities such as feeding, resting, or mating (Gill et al., 1996; Frid and Dill, 2002; Beale and Monaghan, 2004b). Observable responses by seabirds include flying off, escape diving, and increased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9638636873578969292&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zPinOCtRw4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
