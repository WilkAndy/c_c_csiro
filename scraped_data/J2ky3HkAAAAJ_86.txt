Depending on the amount and quality of information available, these assessments range from fully quantitative integrated model-based assessments, to simple assessments based on trends in standardised catch rates. Nearly all of the SESSF assessments use some form of catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series as the main index of stock abundance, however CPUE data have some inherent problems, particularly in a multispecies fishery."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=b05d2e5321ed2d7aaf86c3f39ec75b9bf2574d98", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eTTOPmAZ8M8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
