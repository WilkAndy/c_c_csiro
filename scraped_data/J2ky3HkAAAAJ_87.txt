Component distributions can either be from the family of multivariate normals or from the family of multivariate t-distributions. Maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters are obtained using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/mix_soft/mfa/EMMIXmfa-manual.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dmZJkIMZOuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
