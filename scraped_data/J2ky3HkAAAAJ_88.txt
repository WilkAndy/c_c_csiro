In Press). The question of performance of a mark-recapture approach to return abundance estimate for Antarctic blue whales has been dealt with elsewhere (Peel et al. 2014), so here we are exploring only line transect surveys.In particular, in this short note we are considering how variance of an abundance estimate\u2014its precision\u2014might be predicted for varying amounts of survey effort, given the situation that the study population is, in fact, increasing. As reported by (Burnham, Anderson & Laake 1980) and (Taylor & Gerrodette 1993), for a given amount of effort of a line transect survey, the precision of a resultant abundance estimate is theoretically inversely proportional to the square root of the abundance. However, as a population increases, there may be changes in the way individuals and groups distribute themselves in their habitat. If this is the case, there might be concomitant changes in the distributional properties of sightings given a line transect survey. Here we present a method that accounts for some potential changes in the distributional properties of sightings with an increasing underlying population for Antarctic blue whales, in context of predicting the precision for a given amount of survey effort."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/site/assets/files/1039/sc-65b-sh13.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8bdyb59grUkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
