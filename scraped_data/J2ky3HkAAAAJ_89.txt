Tracking blue whales through passive acoustic monitoring has been identified as a potential means for increasing encounter rates, and thus facilitating abundance estimates through photo-identification and biopsy. This methodology was pursued by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) using DIFAR sonobuoys to detect, localise and track Antarctic blue whales on a research cruise from 140 E to 165 W, and south of 60 S between January and March 2013. Antarctic blue whales make loud and distinctive calls, known as \u2018Z\u2019and \u2018D\u2019calls. The loudest element of the \u2018Z\u2019call (a 26Hz tone) was detected at a range of hundreds of kilometres. 26Hz calls were detected on all DIFAR sonobuoys deployed south of 52 S (n= 298 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9309438113852637278&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
