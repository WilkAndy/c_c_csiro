The purpose of this camera system was to record the presence of whales beneath the aircraft and to provide information regarding local sea ice conditions. Although this aerial survey programme has finished, we arranged for flights to take photographs of potential whale habitat within Vincennes Bay (East Antarctica 66\u00ba 24\u2019S 110\u00ba 18\u2019E) when aircraft time allowed during the normal summer aviation schedule of the Australian Antarctic Division. Digital photographs of potential whale habitat were derived from two flights on 2 and 23 January, 2011, covering around 47 and 42 km2 of sea surface, respectively. Unfortunately photographs from both flights did not yield any whale sightings. This result is compared and contrasted to whale sightings in photographs taken during a single day of an aerial survey during the 2008/09 summer season. It is hoped more flights in coming summer seasons, using Australian Antarctic Division aircraft, can be dedicated to photographing whale habitat in order to both develop \u2018observerless\u2019 aerial survey methods and to study whale populations in pack ice in East Antarctica."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "J2ky3HkAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.marinemammals.gov.au/site/assets/files/1080/sc-63-ia4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AKxj0BUE4usJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
