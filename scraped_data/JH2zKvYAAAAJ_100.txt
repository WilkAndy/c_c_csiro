We describe the isolation and characterization of a maize cDNA that encodes a protein, OCSBF-1, that binds specifically to ocs-element sequences. The 21-kilodalton OCSBF-1 protein was encoded by a single copy, intron-less gene. The gene was differentially expressed in maize plants. Developing leaves had a gradient of OCSBF-1 mRNA with the basal portion of the leaves, which contain dividing and differentiating cells, having 40-fold to 50-fold higher levels of OCSBF-1 transcripts than the apical portion of the leaves, where the cells are fully differentiated. Roots and shoots of young plants had levels of OCSBF-1 mRNA similar to the basal portions of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14917273736560730509", "cites_id": ["14917273736560730509"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/2/9/891/5983265", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jWH3pG3NBM8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 6, "1992": 26, "1993": 22, "1994": 17, "1995": 9, "1996": 11, "1997": 6, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
