FLC expression is repressed by vernalization and in plants with low levels of DNA methylation, resulting in early flowering. This repression is not associated with changes of DNA methylation within the FLC locus in either vernalized plants or plants with low levels of DNA methylation. In both cases, there is a reduction of histone H3 trimethyl\u2010lysine 4 (K4) and acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 around the promoter\u2010translation start of FLC. The expression of the two genes flanking FLC is also repressed in both conditions and repression is associated with decreased histone H3 acetylation. The changes in histone modifications at the FLC gene cluster, which are similar in vernalized plants and in plants with reduced DNA methylation, must arise by different mechanisms.
