(cotton) fibres are specialized trichomes a few centimetres in length that grow from the seed coat. Few genes directly involved in the differentiation of these epidermal cells have been identified. These include GhMYB25\u2010like and GhMYB25, two related MYB transcription factors that regulate fibre cell initiation and expansion. We have also identified a putative homeodomain leucine zipper (HD\u2010ZIP) transcription factor, GhHD\u20101, expressed in trichomes and early fibres that might play a role in cotton fibre initiation. Here, we characterize GhHD\u20101 homoeologues from tetraploid G. hirsutum and show, using reporter constructs and quantitative real\u2010time PCR (qRT\u2010PCR), that they are expressed predominantly in epidermal tissues during early fibre development, and in other tissues bearing epidermal trichomes. Silencing of GhHD\u20101 reduced trichome formation and delayed the timing of fibre \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 140, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1245629333765312510", "cites_id": ["1245629333765312510"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05003.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_k_jiEddSREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 21, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 18, "2021": 14, "2022": 21, "2023": 10}}
