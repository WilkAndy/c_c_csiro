The highest expression level obtained was ca. 0.3% of total soluble protein when the cDNA was driven by the Arabidopsis rbcS ats1 promoter. Repeated feeding trials with Helicoverpa armigera larvae fed on clonally derived T0 and T1 plants expressing GTPI demonstrated that, relative to those fed on control plants, some growth inhibition (22\u201340%) occurs, but there was no increase in larval mortality. Proteinase activities of larvae fed on GTPI-expressing tobacco or GTPI-containing diet were examined to monitor the spectrum of digestive proteinases in the midgut. Total proteinase activity was reduced by 13%, but GTPI-insensitive proteinase activity was increased by up to 17%. Trypsin was inhibited by 58%, but chymotrypsin and elastase were increased by 26% and 16% respectively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 137, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17662647772487548929", "cites_id": ["17662647772487548929"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009681323131", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AQD3f5FUHvUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 9, "2000": 8, "2001": 6, "2002": 7, "2003": 6, "2004": 8, "2005": 14, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 10, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
