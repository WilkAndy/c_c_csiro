These HindIII-spared sequences are mostly located in telomeric heterochromatin. When digested with EcoRI* and cloned into the EcoRI site of pBR 325, these sequences yielded clones of two classes when hybridized to a probe of rapidly renaturing DNA. One class contains a DNA sequence which is a major constituent of the telomeric heterochromatic blocks, while the other is a minor component of the highly repeated DNA of the genome. The major component was sequenced, its chromosomal distribution mapped using wheat-rye addition lines and its distribution in meiotic prophase nuclei determined. The minor component is present in significant amounts in wheat as well as in rye and is localized at the terminal heterochromatic regions of three rye chromosomes but not in the major blocks \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 137, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14598345261076979565", "cites_id": ["14598345261076979565"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00399137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bR8Aa6u9l8oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 8, "1984": 10, "1985": 2, "1986": 10, "1987": 5, "1988": 4, "1989": 4, "1990": 5, "1991": 4, "1992": 6, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 9, "1996": 5, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
