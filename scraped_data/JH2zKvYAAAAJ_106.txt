Antisense and sense non-coding RNAs have been respectively implicated in initiation and maintenance of FLC repression by vernalization. We show that the promoter and first exon of the FLC gene are sufficient to initiate repression during vernalization; this initial repression of FLC does not require antisense transcription. Long-term maintenance of FLC repression requires additional regions of the gene body, including those encoding sense non-coding transcripts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 136, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8135410353848213120", "cites_id": ["8135410353848213120"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021513", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gF4oE53I5nAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 15, "2013": 11, "2014": 21, "2015": 14, "2016": 11, "2017": 16, "2018": 8, "2019": 15, "2020": 12, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
