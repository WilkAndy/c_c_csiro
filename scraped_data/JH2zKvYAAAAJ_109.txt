In varieties that require prolonged exposure to cold to flower (vernalization), VRN1 is expressed at low levels and is induced by vernalization to trigger flowering. In other varieties, deletions or insertions in the first intron of the VRN1 gene are associated with increased VRN1 expression in the absence of cold treatment, reducing or eliminating the requirement for vernalization. To characterize natural variation in VRN1, the first intron of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) was assayed for deletions or insertions in a collection of 1,000 barleys from diverse geographical regions. Ten alleles of HvVRN1 containing deletions or insertions in the first intron were identified, including three alleles that have not been described previously. Different HvVRN1 alleles were associated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10074823342277355904", "cites_id": ["10074823342277355904"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00438-009-0449-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gGlBe3P20IsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 15, "2012": 9, "2013": 14, "2014": 15, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
