The FIS2\u2237GUS product is found in the embryo sac, in each of the polar cell nuclei, and in the central cell nucleus. After pollination, the maternally derived FIS2\u2237GUS protein occurs in the nuclei of the cenocytic endosperm. Before cellularization of the endosperm, activity is terminated in the micropylar and central nuclei of the endosperm and subsequently in the nuclei of the chalazal cyst. MEA\u2237GUS has a pattern of activity similar to that of FIS2\u2237GUS, but FIE\u2237GUS protein is found in many tissues, including the prepollination embryo sac, and in embryo and endosperm postpollination. The similarity in mutant phenotypes; the activity of FIE, MEA, and FIS2 in the same cells in the embryo sac; and the fact that MEA and FIE proteins \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 516, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3201917642635236694", "cites_id": ["3201917642635236694"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.170292997", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VlVUqSF_bywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 27, "2002": 21, "2003": 37, "2004": 26, "2005": 32, "2006": 28, "2007": 29, "2008": 35, "2009": 22, "2010": 26, "2011": 20, "2012": 26, "2013": 29, "2014": 15, "2015": 23, "2016": 18, "2017": 17, "2018": 13, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 18, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
