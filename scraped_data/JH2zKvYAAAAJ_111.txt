Heynh. mutant amp1 of has been further characterised. We extend our previous work on the cytokinin level in the amp1 mutant and show that it contains high levels of endogenous cytokinins in both light- and dark-grown plants, and that amp1 can be phenocopied in the dark by growing wild-type plants on exogenous cytokinin. Previously we showed that dark-grown amp1 plants display de-etiolated characteristics such as short unhooked hypocotyls, opened cotyledons and formation of leaves. We further show that amp1 mutants display de-etiolated plastid morphology and increased levels of transcripts of light-regulated genes, indicating that in this mutant light-mediated processes are partially induced in the dark. The amp1 mutant also shows a reduced level of expression of several light-regulated genes compared with the wild type when grown in light, and has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 127, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14510374241283278654", "cites_id": ["14510374241283278654"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00262641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PgerQX40X8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 9, "1998": 10, "1999": 7, "2000": 1, "2001": 14, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
