Our transcriptome analysis of a number of Arabidopsis F1 hybrids identified changes to defense and stress response gene expression consistent with a reduction in basal defense levels. Given the reported antagonism between plant immunity and growth, we suggest that these altered patterns of expression contribute to the greater growth of the hybrids. The altered patterns of expression in the hybrids indicate decreases to the salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis pathway and increases in the auxin [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)] biosynthesis pathway. SA and IAA are hormones known to control stress and defense responses as well as plant growth. We found that IAA-targeted gene activity is frequently increased in hybrids, correlating with a common heterotic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16994024692192480197", "cites_id": ["16994024692192480197"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1519926112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xYtZWmvn1usJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 7, "2017": 22, "2018": 16, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 24, "2022": 15, "2023": 11}}
