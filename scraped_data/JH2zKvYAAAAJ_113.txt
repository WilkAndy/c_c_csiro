The over-expression of PDC was used not only to assess the role of alcohol fermentation but also to produce lines with enhanced metabolic capacity under anaerobiosis conferring submergence tolerance to these lines. Tillers of confirmed T0 transgenic lines showed higher PDC activities and ethanol production compared to the untransformed control. Consequently, ethanol production of tillers of T0 transgenic plants was positively correlated with survival after submergence. This is the first known report of transformation of an economically-important crop resulting in increased submergence tolerance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16934615129084729828", "cites_id": ["16934615129084729828"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176161700801674", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5BkNibzWA-sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 7, "2003": 14, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 9, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 1, "2011": 8, "2012": 2, "2013": 8, "2014": 11, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
