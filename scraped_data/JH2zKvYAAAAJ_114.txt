These genes are expressed in thin cell layer explants initiating floral meristems but not in thin cell layer explants initiating vegetative shoot meristems or possessing roots. Two of these genes are expressed transcriptionally in incipient floral apices during normal plant development. Transcripts of these genes, plus a third gene, occur at low levels in several plant organs and at high levels in the roots, with the maximum levels of root expression reached just prior to the formation of floral meristems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 125, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13290920050018611536", "cites_id": ["13290920050018611536"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/1/1/25/5970201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UPF5_13VcrgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 5, "1990": 13, "1991": 8, "1992": 12, "1993": 5, "1994": 7, "1995": 3, "1996": 6, "1997": 4, "1998": 7, "1999": 6, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
