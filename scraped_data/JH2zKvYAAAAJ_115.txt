Plants regenerated from the cultures showed a high frequency of activation of Ac. That activation was shown to be associated with reduced methylation of cytosine residues at the 5\u2032 end of the transposable element. An examination of Ac activity and methylation status of the Ac element in progenies of the regenerant plants demonstrated transmission of the altered epigenotype through two sexual generations. In these progenies no evidence for trans activation of inactive, partially methylated, Ac elements was obtained. These results confirm that in certain instances altered methylation patterns can be inherited through the germ line."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10193691908117850059", "cites_id": ["10193691908117850059"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00267457", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y2cjLchEd40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 4, "1993": 5, "1994": 8, "1995": 3, "1996": 7, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 7, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 7, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
