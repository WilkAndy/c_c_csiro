Loci in the autonomous flowering pathway control FLC levels. We show the epistatic groupings of autonomous pathway mutants fca/fy and fve/fpa, based on their effects on flowering time, are consistent with their effects on FLC transcript and protein levels. We demonstrate that synergistic increases in FLC mRNA and protein expression occur in response to interactions between the autonomous pathway mutants fca and fpa and mutants in other pathways (fe, ft, fha) that do not regulate FLC when present as single mutants. These changes in FLC levels provide the molecular basis of the interactions previously shown in genetic analyses. The interactions between genes of multiple pathways emphasize the central position of FLC in the control of floral initiation. FLC protein levels match those of its mRNA for a range of genetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16911807298239219253", "cites_id": ["16911807298239219253"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0960-7412.2001.01210.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NUZomSLPsuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 12, "2004": 19, "2005": 8, "2006": 10, "2007": 3, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
