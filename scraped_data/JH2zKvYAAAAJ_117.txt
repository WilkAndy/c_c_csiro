In contrast to mammalian cells in which 3\u20138% of cytosine residues are methylated (Shapiro, 1975), in plants up to 30% of cytosine residues are modified (Adams and Burdon, 1985). There is considerable inter-species variation in the level of cytosine methylation, ranging from 4.6% in Arabidopsis thaliana (Leutwiler et al., 1984), which has a small genome with relatively little highly repeated DNA, to 33% in rye, Secale cereale (Thomas and Sherratt, 1956). The difference in the extent of methylation, between plants and animals, is due to two factors. The CG dinucleotide, which is methylated to about the same extent (70\u201380%) in plants and animals, occurs more frequently in plant DNA. In addition plant DNA is methylated in CNG trinucleotides where N can be any base (Gruenbaum et al., 1981).
