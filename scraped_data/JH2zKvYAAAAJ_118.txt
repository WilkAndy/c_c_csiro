The tissue-specific pattern of expression of certain P alleles suggests that P may be a complex locus, with more than one functional unit. The P-VV allele, which specifies variegated pericarp and variegated cob, however, shows that insertion and excision of the transposable element Ac affects both pericarp and cob expression as though cob and pericarp pigmentation are controlled by a single gene. Using Ac as a transposon tag, we have isolated 34 kb of genomic DNA from the P-VV and P-RR allele. The cloned DNA contains two 5.8 kb cross-hybridizing regions, in direct orientation relative to each other, separated by 6.6 kb of intervening DNA. A sequence motif of 250 by is repeated at three locations within the cloned region: once within each of the 5.8 kb repeats, and once outside the 5.8 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15863170596486762365", "cites_id": ["15863170596486762365"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00261181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fc8DX5xNJdwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 6, "1992": 3, "1993": 8, "1994": 8, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 4, "1999": 9, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
