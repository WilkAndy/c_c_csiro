This is important in the use of F 1 hybrid cultivars in many crops and vegetables. However, the molecular mechanism of heterosis is not clearly understood. Gene interactions between the two genomes such as dominance, overdominance, and epistasis have been suggested to explain the increased biomass and yield. Genetic analyses of F 1 hybrids in maize, rice, and canola have defined a large number of quantitative trait loci, which may contribute to heterosis. Recent molecular analyses of transcriptomes together with reference to the epigenome of the parents and hybrids have begun to uncover new facts about the generation of heterosis. These include the identification of gene expression changes in hybrids, which may be important for heterosis, the role of epigenetic processes in heterosis, and the development of stable high yielding lines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17293457996972131112", "cites_id": ["17293457996972131112"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsbbs/68/2/68_17155/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KIOpb2y0_u8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 30, "2021": 27, "2022": 30, "2023": 18}}
