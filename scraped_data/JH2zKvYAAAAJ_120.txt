Analysis of the subsequent generations suggested that late flowering in Kiruna-2 is recessive and mainly determined by a single, late flowering gene. This late flowering gene is not, however, the same as that in any of the late flowering mutants generated in the Landsbergerecta background. Both Pitztal and Innsbruck appear to contain the same dominant gene which confers late flowering to these ecotypes. The early flowering parents Niederzenz and Landsberg both contain genes which modify the phenotype of this dominant late flowering locus, causing F1 plants to flower either earlier (Landsberg) or later (Niederzenz) than the late parent.
