Sequence analysis of this DNA gives strong support to the proposal that maize originated by selection of variants in teosinte. In situ hybridization has confirmed that this repeating DNA sequence, which is the major component of maize knob heterochromatin, is also the major component of knobs in teosinte,Zea diploperennis andTripsacum. In Southern blot hybridizations the repeat has a similar basic organization in all taxa;Tripsacum, however, is differentiated from maize and teosinte by a number of sequence features. Maize and teosinte knob heterochromatin are indistinguishable with regard to the distribution of mutations in the 180-bp repeat and the presence and organization of a 202-bp variant sequence. The knob DNA sequence was not detectable in three species ofCoix, an Old \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3177692937619249793", "cites_id": ["3177692937619249793"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02104740", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gRoQAORuGSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 6, "1989": 1, "1990": 5, "1991": 6, "1992": 5, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
