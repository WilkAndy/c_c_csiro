Significant genetic variation in flowering time and response to vernalisation were observed among the DH lines from Skipton/Ag-Spectrum. A molecular linkage map was generated comprising 674 simple sequence repeat, sequence-related amplified polymorphism, sequence characterised amplified region, Diversity Array Technology, and candidate gene based markers loci. QTL analysis indicated that flowering time is a complex trait and is controlled by at least 20 loci, localised on ten different chromosomes. These loci each accounted for between 2.4 and 28.6 % of the total genotypic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6782461445005588779", "cites_id": ["6782461445005588779"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-012-1966-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KzlXzL8kIF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 17, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 16, "2019": 16, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
