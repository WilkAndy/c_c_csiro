A line transformed with an antisense Adh1 construct had only 4\u20138% of the ADH activity of untransformed plants. This line showed reduced ethanol production and coleoptile growth under anoxia. Mature plants had reduced survival when submerged in water and exposed to anoxia, suggesting that ADH plays an essential role in seed germination and plant survival in the absence of O2. A transgenic line transformed with a cotton Adh2 cDNA in the sense orientation relative to a constitutive promoter, showed 3\u20134-fold more ADH activity than either untransformed controls, or a flooding-tolerant rice variety (FR13A), both in air and under hypoxia. However, ethanol production by this line was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7484903042435000456", "cites_id": ["7484903042435000456"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP00137", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iCiUDqm332cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 9, "2004": 8, "2005": 1, "2006": 9, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 10, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
