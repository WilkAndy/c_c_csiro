Two adjacent and functionally identical protein\u2010binding sites separated by an exact number of nucleotides are required for in vivo activity of the ocs\u2010element. Plant pathogens have presumably recruited cellular transcription factors that interact with these binding sites to drive the high\u2010level expression of their essential genes. Our functional analyses of the ocs\u2010elements from two pathogen promoters define the structure of a sequence motif that might also be expected to occur in plant nuclear genes, and a search of the plant gene database has identified a number of plant gene promoters that contain sequences that resemble the ocs\u2010element. These sequences were analysed for their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17757496123660407301", "cites_id": ["17757496123660407301"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1993.04030433.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BZInJ6RMb_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 6, "1995": 6, "1996": 10, "1997": 7, "1998": 6, "1999": 10, "2000": 5, "2001": 9, "2002": 9, "2003": 4, "2004": 7, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
