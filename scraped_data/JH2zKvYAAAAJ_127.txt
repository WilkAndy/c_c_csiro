We have identified five additional genes encoding putative DNA methyltransferases. Three of these genes are very similar to METI throughout the coding region; these genes probably arose by a series of gene duplication events, the most recent giving rise to METIIa and METIIb. METIIa and b are expressed at low levels in vegetative and floral organs and the level of transcripts is not affected by the introduction of a METI antisense transgene, nor do the METII enzymes substitute for the reduced activity of METI in methylating CG dinucleotides. METIII is not essential as it encodes a truncated protein. Two other genes encode a second class of DNA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12031975227439742617", "cites_id": ["12031975227439742617"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006347010369", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mX7Yobgp-qYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 7, "2003": 11, "2004": 4, "2005": 10, "2006": 5, "2007": 5, "2008": 8, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 9, "2012": 9, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
