We cloned the gene for 2,4-D monooxygenase, the first enzyme in the plasmid-encoded 2,4-D degradative pathway of the bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus, into a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter expression vector and introduced it into tobacco plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the highest levels of the monooxygenase enzyme exhibited increased tolerance to 2,4-D in leaf disc and seed germination assays, and young plants survived spraying with levels of herbicide up to eight times the usual field application rate. The introduction of the gene for 2,4-D monooxygenase into broad-leaved crop plants, such as cotton, should eventually allow 2,4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4922198827470625330", "cites_id": ["4922198827470625330"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00027313", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mho7McEpT0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 4, "1992": 6, "1993": 10, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
