The ARE functions in both orientations although inversion of the ARE sequence relative to the TATA box element produces slightly weaker promoter activity under anaerobic conditions and elevated expression under aerobic conditions. Promoter activity under anaerobic conditions is proportional to the number of complete ARE sequences in the Adh1 promotor. The ARE contains two sub-regions and dimers of sub-region II are as efficient as the wild-type sequence in activating gene expression under anaerobic conditions. However, sub-region I dimers do not appear capable of inducing gene expression in response to anaerobic stress. We conclude that sub-region II is essential for anaerobic induction of gene expression \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4650118843637261288", "cites_id": ["4650118843637261288"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00017834", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6GNZbnOKiEAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 6, "1992": 3, "1993": 6, "1994": 9, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 7, "1998": 3, "1999": 6, "2000": 8, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
