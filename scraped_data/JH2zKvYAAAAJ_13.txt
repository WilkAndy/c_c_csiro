These genes have now been isolated and shown to regulate not only the vernalization response but also the promotion of flowering by long days. VRN1 is induced by vernalization and accelerates the transition to reproductive development at the shoot apex. FT is induced by long days and further accelerates reproductive apex development. VRN2, a floral repressor, integrates vernalization and day-length responses by repressing FT until plants are vernalized. A comparison of flowering time pathways in cereals and Arabidopsis shows that the vernalization response is controlled by different MADS box genes, but integration of vernalization and long-day responses occurs through similar mechanisms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 469, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15786330857738774607", "cites_id": ["15786330857738774607"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138507001562", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T6hOikZQFNsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 17, "2009": 32, "2010": 36, "2011": 23, "2012": 33, "2013": 42, "2014": 36, "2015": 34, "2016": 40, "2017": 30, "2018": 21, "2019": 24, "2020": 28, "2021": 36, "2022": 25, "2023": 6}}
