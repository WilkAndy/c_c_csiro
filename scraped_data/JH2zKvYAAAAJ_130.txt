Transgenic plants from two lines tested were resistant to first instars of chrysomelid beetles that are important pests of commercial Australian eucalypt plantations. Both lines also exhibit tolerance to the broad-spectrum herbicide Liberty\u00ae at 6 l/ha (1.2 kg active ingredient per hectare), twice the field application rate. Transgenic insect- and herbicide-resistant eucalypts like these are likely to provide better insect and weed control options in plantations, particularly during the vulnerable establishment phase, provided that any adverse ecological impacts of releasing transgenic trees into the environment can be assessed and minimized."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11136056326103320961", "cites_id": ["11136056326103320961"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009676214328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gUkhLDo4i5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 10, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
