The promotion of flowering is mediated through an epigenetic down\u2010regulation of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). We present results that provide an insight into the quantitative regulation of FLC by vernalization. Analysis of the effect of seed or plant cold treatment on FLC expression indicates that the time\u2010dependent nature of vernalization on FLC expression is mediated through the extent of the initial repression of FLC and not by affecting the ability to maintain the repressed state. In the over\u2010expression mutant flc\u201011, the time\u2010dependent repression of FLC correlates with the proportional deacetylation of histone H3. Our results indicate that sequences within intron 1 and the activities of both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=941506031809406806", "cites_id": ["941506031809406806"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02652.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VifjY7_mEA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 16, "2008": 9, "2009": 10, "2010": 5, "2011": 10, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
