Competition analyses show that the GCBP-1 binding activity distinguishes ARE sequence motifs from other enhancer elements or pUC19 sequences. The binding activities of several mutant ARE sequences define two regions of the ARE important for GCBP\u22121 binding              In vitro             , between nucleotides\u2212135 to \u2212131 and nucleotides \u2212120 to \u2212112 of the maize              Adh1              promoter. Both regions are required for efficient GCBP\u22121 binding to occur              In vitro             . The minimum consensus binding site for GCBP\u22121 is 5\u2032-GC(G/C)CC-3\u2032. This sequence is similar to a part of the binding site of the human transcription factor Sp1 (1).
