One of these contains a complete gene, has exon sequences corresponding to one of the cDNA sequences and is likely to be an expressed gene. This gene has a structure similar to the Adh genes of maize, with introns in the same positions in the coding sequence but differing in their lengths and nucleotide sequences. At the nucleotide level the coding sequence is 75% homologous to both maize Adh1 and Adh2 and 80% homologous to the Adh gene from Arabidopsis, but has an extra coding triplet in exon 1 that is not found in the other plant Adh genes. The non-translated regions of all the gene transcripts are widely divergent between species.A short segment of the pea Adh promoter region (\u2212290 to +57) was fused to a reporter gene and introduced into \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15661089272564019606", "cites_id": ["15661089272564019606"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283687903317", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lvHbprddV9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 9, "1990": 10, "1991": 7, "1992": 7, "1993": 11, "1994": 9, "1995": 5, "1996": 10, "1997": 6, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
