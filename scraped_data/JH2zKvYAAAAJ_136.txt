In Arabidopsis, loss of PRC2 function leads to pleiotropic effects on growth and development thought to be due to ectopic expression of seed and embryo-specific genes. While there is some understanding of the mechanisms by which specific genes are targeted by PRC2 in animal systems, it is still not clear how PRC2 is recruited to specific regions of plant genomes.We used ChIP-seq to determine the genome-wide distribution of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged FERTLIZATION INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE-HA), the Extra Sex Combs homolog protein present in all Arabidopsis PRC2 complexes. We found that the FIE-HA binding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3929558856158096924", "cites_id": ["3929558856158096924"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-14-593", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HC5LwfWYiDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 14, "2016": 18, "2017": 22, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
