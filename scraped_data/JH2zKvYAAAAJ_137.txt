AtSOC1 and OsSOC1 show a 97% amino acid similarity in their MADS domain. The rice gene contains a large first intron of 27.6 kb compared to the 1 kb intron in Arabidopsis. OsSOC1 is located on top of the short arm of chromosome 3, tightly linked to the heading date locus, Hd9. OsSOC1 is expressed in vegetative tissues, and expression is elevated at the time of floral initiation, 40\u201350 days after sowing, and remains uniformly high thereafter, similar to the expression pattern of AtSOC1. The constitutive expression of OsSOC1 in Arabidopsis results in early flowering, suggesting that the rice gene is a functional equivalent of AtSOC1. We were not able to identify FLC\u2010like sequences in the rice genome; however, we show that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7270727323126189380", "cites_id": ["7270727323126189380"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1467-7652.2003.00034.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RM2pefrP5mQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 7, "2005": 10, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 4}}
