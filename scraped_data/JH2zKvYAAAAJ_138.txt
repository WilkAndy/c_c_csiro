Restriction endonuclease mapping shows that a region of less than 5 kb is conserved in both alleles and is flanked both 5' and 3' by regions highly polymorphic for restriction sites. Nucleotide sequence comparison of these two alleles reveals that polymorphism in the 3' flanking region is due to rearrangements including tandem duplications, a transposable element-like insertion and a deletion. S1 nuclease analysis shows that both the Adh1-1S and the Adh1-1F alleles contain multiple poly(A) addition sites; four sites are observed for the Adh1-1S alleles and seven sites for the Adh1-1F allele. Only two of these poly(A) addition sites appear to be identical in the two alleles. No consensus signal for poly(A) addition is observed near any of these sites."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12529972389513581157", "cites_id": ["12529972389513581157"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/113/2/449/5996972", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZdJoaoBn460J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 9, "1988": 10, "1989": 11, "1990": 10, "1991": 2, "1992": 7, "1993": 8, "1994": 10, "1995": 5, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
