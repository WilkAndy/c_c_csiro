Treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine induced nonvernalized plants to flower significantly earlier than untreated controls. Cytidine at similar concentrations had no effect on time to flower. In contrast, late-flowering mutants that are insensitive to vernalization did not respond to 5-azacytidine treatment. Normal flowering time was reset in the progeny of plants induced to flower early with 5-azacytidine, paralleling the lack of inheritance of the vernalized condition. Arabidopsis plants, either cold-treated or 5-azacytidine-treated, had reduced levels of 5-methylcytosine in their DNA compared to nonvernalized plants. A Nicotiana plumbaginifolia cell line also showed a marked decrease in the level of 5-methylcytosine after treatment with either 5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 459, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11398868634306309241", "cites_id": ["11398868634306309241"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.90.1.287", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eWwrDaHqMJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 5, "1994": 9, "1995": 8, "1996": 13, "1997": 13, "1998": 13, "1999": 15, "2000": 19, "2001": 12, "2002": 24, "2003": 16, "2004": 17, "2005": 25, "2006": 17, "2007": 23, "2008": 21, "2009": 11, "2010": 24, "2011": 22, "2012": 17, "2013": 23, "2014": 15, "2015": 13, "2016": 15, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 4, "2022": 14, "2023": 1}}
