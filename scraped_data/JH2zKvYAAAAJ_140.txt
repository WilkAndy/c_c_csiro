We examined the role of the grass-specific MADS box gene ODDSOC2 (OS2) in the vernalization response in cereals. The barley OS2 gene (HvOS2) is expressed in leaves and shoot apices but is repressed by vernalization. Vernalization represses OS2 independently of VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) in a VRN1 deletion mutant of einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), but VRN1 is required to maintain down-regulation of OS2 in vernalized plants. Furthermore, barleys that carry active alleles of the VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) have reduced expression of HvOS2, suggesting that HvVRN1 down-regulates HvOS2 during development. Overexpression of HvOS2 delayed flowering and reduced spike, stem, and leaf length in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4901809588863791371", "cites_id": ["4901809588863791371"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/153/3/1062/6109438", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:C3HUpNm5BkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
