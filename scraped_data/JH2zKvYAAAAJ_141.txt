Here we describe detailed developmental analyses of four mutants, each of which defines a complementation group and has a distinct developmental end point. All four mutants represent premeiotic developmental lesions. In ms3, tapetum and middle layer hypertrophy result in the degeneration of microsporocytes. In ms4, microspore dyads persist for most of anther development as a result of impaired meiotic division. In ms5, degeneration occurs in all anther cells at an early stage of development. In ms15, both the tapetum and microsporocytes degenerate early in anther development. Each of these mutants had shorter filaments and a greater number of inflorescences than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 97, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4138221220535183844", "cites_id": ["4138221220535183844"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00241884", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5Kn7W0bqbTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 6, "1996": 6, "1997": 8, "1998": 10, "1999": 7, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 8, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
