Heynh. (ecotype columbia) are described that show a postmeiotic defect of microspore development. In ms9 mutants, microspores recently released from the tetrad appear irregular in shape and are often without exines. The earliest evidence of abnormality in ms12 mutants is degeneration of microspores that lack normal exine sculpturing, suggesting that the MS12 product is important in the formation of pollen exine. Teratomes (abnormally enlarged microsporocytes) are also occasionally present and each has a poorly developed exine. In ms7 mutant plants, the tapetal cytoplasm disintegrates at the late vacuolate microspore stage, apparently causing the degeneration of microspores and pollen grains. With ms8 mutants, the exine of the microspores appears similar to that of the wild type. However, intine development appears \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4490798494557689393", "cites_id": ["4490798494557689393"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004250050348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MVb4AXCFUj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 10, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
