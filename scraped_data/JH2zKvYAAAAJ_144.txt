Followingin vitro modification and the addition of plant expression signals, the gene for 2,4-D monooxygenase, a bacterial enzyme that degrades the broadleaf herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), was introduced into cotton plants byAgrobacterium-mediated transformation. First generation homozygous progeny of regenerated transgenic cotton plants carrying this gene exhibited up to a 50\u2013100 fold increase in tolerance to 2,4-D compared with untransformed controls, and glasshouse trials suggest that the genetically-engineered plants would be completely protected from spray drift of 2,4-D, at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2008163526526435365", "cites_id": ["2008163526526435365"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01972610", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JQCBcRZu3hsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 9, "2001": 8, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 6}}
