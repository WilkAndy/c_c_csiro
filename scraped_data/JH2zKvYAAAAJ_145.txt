Using a two-element Ac/Ds transposon tagging system we have isolated a rice mutant, designated branched floretless 1 (bfl1) which is defective in the transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem. The bfl1 mutant shows normal differentiation of the primary rachis-branches leading to initial spikelet meristem (bract-like structure equivalent to rudimentary glumes) formation but fails to develop empty glumes and florets. Instead, axillary meristems in the bract-like structure produce sequential alternate branching, thus resulting in a coral shaped morphology of the branches in the developing panicle. The bfl1 mutant harbours a single Ds insertion in the upstream region of the BFL1 gene on chromosome 7 corresponding to PAC clone P0625E02 (GenBank Acc No. message URL http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=nucleotide&list_uids=34395191&dopt=GenBank&term=ap004570AP004570). RT-PCR analyses revealed a drastic reduction of BFL1 transcript levels in the bfl1 mutant compared to that in the wild-type. In each of the normal panicle-bearing progeny plants, from occasional revertant seeds of the vegetatively-propagated mutant plant, Ds was shown to be excised from the bfl1 locus. BFL1 contains an EREBP/AP2 domain and is most likely an ortholog of the maize transcription factor gene BRANCHED SILKLESS1 (BD1). bfl1 is a Ds-tagged rice mutant defective in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6262576918901921616", "cites_id": ["6262576918901921616"], "pub_url": "https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2229-3-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UJe19YYk6VYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 12, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
