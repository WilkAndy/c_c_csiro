A glucose oxidase gene from T. flavus, was modified with a carrot extensin signal peptide and fused to either a constitutive or root-specific plant promoter. T1 tobacco plants expressing the enzyme constitutively were protected against infection by the seedling pathogen Rhizoctonia solani. Constitutive expression in tobacco was associated with reduced root growth, and slow germination on culture medium, and with reduced seed set in glasshouse conditions. Several independent transformed cotton plants with a root-specific construct expressed high glucose oxidase activity in the roots, excluding the root tip. Selected T3 homozygous lines showed some protection against the root pathogen \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=555267890185817000", "cites_id": ["555267890185817000"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009625801909", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qMu0RTS1tAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 8, "2007": 8, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
