(1986). Nature 324, 166-168; Bogusz et al. (1988). Nature 331, 178-180]. The promoters of these genes have been linked to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene and introduced into both the nonlegume Nicotiana tabacum and the legume Lotus corniculatus. Both promoters directed root-specific expression in transgenic tobacco. When transgenic Lotus plants were nodulated by Rhizobium loti, both promoter constructs showed a high level of nodule-specific expression confined to the central bacteroid-containing portion of the nodule corresponding to the expression seen for the endogenous Lotus leghemoglobin gene. The T. tomentosa promoter was also expressed at a low level in the vascular tissue of the Lotus roots.
