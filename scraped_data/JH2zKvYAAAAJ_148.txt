Two independent DNA METHYLTRANSFERASEI (METI) antisense transformants with low levels of DNA methylation had flowers with increased numbers of stamens which resembled flowers seen on the loss-of-function superman (sup) mutant plants and on transgenic plants that ectopically express APETALA3 (AP3). These METI antisense plants have both increased and decreased methylation in and around the sup gene, compared with untransformed controls. DNA from the antisense plants was demethylated at least 4 kb upstream of the sup gene, while there was dense methylation around the start of transcription and within the coding region of this gene; these regions were unmethylated in control DNA. Methylation within the sup gene was correlated with an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6979283483544072614", "cites_id": ["6979283483544072614"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010636222327", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pjFlt1ll22AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 17, "2003": 11, "2004": 8, "2005": 8, "2006": 7, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
