The constructs used have gene or enhancer trapping properties, plasmid rescue and T-DNA/Ds launching pad reporter facilities. Mutagenic iAc/Ds lines were produced by three methods: crossing iAc and Ds containing lines; co-transformation with iAc and Ds constructs; and super-transformation of iAc transgenic calli with Ds constructs. First and second generation screening populations, derived from crosses (F2 and F3) or double transformation (DtT1 and DtT2), were analysed for stable insertion lines containing Ds transposed to locations unlinked to iAc. The average frequencies of putative stable insertion (PSI) lines in the F2, DtT1, F3 and DtT2 populations were 6.61, 5.58, 11.47 and 7.05% respectively, with large variations in these frequencies in screening populations derived from different mutagenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12726546043840765097", "cites_id": ["12726546043840765097"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/PP01205", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qRzI4DLGnbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 15, "2005": 9, "2006": 7, "2007": 13, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
