A microarray containing 3500 cDNA clones was screened with cDNA samples taken at various times (0.5, 2, 4, and 20 h) after transfer to low-oxygen conditions. A package of statistical tools identified 210 differentially expressed genes over the four time points. Principal component analysis showed the 0.5-h response to contain a substantially different set of genes from those regulated differentially at the other three time points. The differentially expressed genes included the known anaerobic proteins as well as transcription factors, signal transduction components, and genes that encode enzymes of pathways not known previously to be involved in low-oxygen metabolism. We found that the regulatory regions of genes with a similar expression profile contained similar sequence motifs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 456, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9749369685869986464", "cites_id": ["9749369685869986464"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/14/10/2481/6009854", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oAI-LhO4TIcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 16, "2004": 26, "2005": 34, "2006": 20, "2007": 29, "2008": 27, "2009": 34, "2010": 33, "2011": 26, "2012": 26, "2013": 29, "2014": 23, "2015": 23, "2016": 18, "2017": 11, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 17, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
