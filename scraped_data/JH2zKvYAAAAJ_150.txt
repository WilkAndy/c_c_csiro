We have targeted the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) genome with a ribozyme containing three catalytic hammerhead domains embedded within a 1 kb antisense RNA. The ribozyme was able to cleave TMV RNA at all three target sites in vitro at 25\u00b0C. Transgenic tobacco plants were generated which expressed the ribozyme or the corresponding antisense constructs directed at the TMV genome. Six of 38 independent transgenic plant lines expressing the ribozyme and 6 of 39 plant lines expressing the antisense gene showed some level of protection against TMV infection. Homozygous progeny of some lines were highly resistant to TMV; at least 50% of the plants remained asymptomatic even when challenged with high levels of TMV \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15878670428840572765", "cites_id": ["15878670428840572765"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02174391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XbeKUKBeXNwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 8, "1998": 8, "1999": 7, "2000": 8, "2001": 9, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
