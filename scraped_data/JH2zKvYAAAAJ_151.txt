Cloning and sequencing shows that the mutant allele derives from Adh1-1S and that there has been a single base change in the coding region of the gene which converts and AAG lysine codon to a TAG stop codon. The rate of nucleotide substitution (two per 218 embryos cultured) is much greater than normal mutation rates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1995796912774989663", "cites_id": ["1995796912774989663"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00337777", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X0fGzbd-shsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 4, "1990": 6, "1991": 9, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 7, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
