Four major satellites of densities 1\u00b7672 g/cm3, 1\u00b7686 g/cm3, 1\u00b7688 g/cm3 and 1\u00b7705 g/cm3 (in CsCl) were purified and characterized with regard to their amounts in the genome, denaturation-renaturation characteristics and their mode of organization. Several minor satellites were found with one (1\u00b7699 g/cm3) apparently representing linkage molecules resulting from covalent joining of large blocks of the major satellites.Analysis of yields of the 1\u00b7705 g/cm3 satellite from DNA of different molecular weights suggested a mean segment length of approximately 106 bases. Since this satellite accounts for between 4 and 5% of the genome, we deduced it to have approximately eight \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3353904015660732232", "cites_id": ["3353904015660732232"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228367780154X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SM82uO51iy4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 4, "1985": 4, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 5, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
