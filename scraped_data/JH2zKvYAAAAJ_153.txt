We reveal extensive variation in flowering time across diverse genotypes of canola under field, glasshouse and controlled environmental conditions. We conduct a genome\u2010wide association study and identify 69 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with flowering time, which are repeatedly detected across experiments. Several associated SNPs occur in clusters across the canola genome; seven of them were detected within 20\u2009Kb regions of a priori candidate genes; FLOWERING LOCUS T, FRUITFUL, FLOWERING LOCUS C, CONSTANS, FRIGIDA, PHYTOCHROME B and an additional five SNPs were localized within 14\u2009Kb of a previously identified quantitative trait loci for flowering time. Expression analyses showed that among FLC paralogs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 89, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4111838464603407092", "cites_id": ["4111838464603407092"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.12644", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9EJ5UEwvEDkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 16, "2019": 13, "2020": 13, "2021": 16, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
