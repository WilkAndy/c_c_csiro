In the first system we demonstrate the interplay between genetic and epigenetic controls over the transcriptional activity of FLC, a major repressor of flowering in Arabidopsis. FLC is down-regulated by low temperature treatment (vernalisation) releasing the repressor effect on flowering. We discuss the mechanisms of the reduced transcription and the memory of the vernalisation treatment through vegetative development. We also discuss the resetting of the repressed activity level of the FLC gene, following vernalisation, to the default high activity level and show it occurs during both male and female gametogenesis but with different timing in each. In the second part of the review discussed the complex multigenic system which is responsible for the patterns of gene activity which bring about hybrid vigour in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7974283390245978011", "cites_id": ["7974283390245978011"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874939911000563", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m7_obX5Yqm4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 12, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 2, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
