We present a protocol for quick isolation of cotton RNA with high yield and good quality. By combining a borate extraction buffer developed by Wan and Wilkins (1994) with Qiagen RNeasy spin columns, plus proteinase K treatment during extraction, we produced RNA from 0 dpa (day postanthesis) cotton ovules at an average yield of 1000 \u03bcg/gfw (gram fresh weight). The poly A+ RNA derived from these RNA preparations was capable of efficient in vitro translation and reverse transcription. This method could also be applied to other cotton tissues, including leaves, 7 dpa fibres, 7 dpa ovules, petals, hypocotyls, and roots, to produce RNA at yields ranging from 300\u20131000 \u03bcg/gfw with little or no degradation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14729829723647023997", "cites_id": ["14729829723647023997"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02782456", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fZv4dxfeaswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 10, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
