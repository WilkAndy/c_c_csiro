Ultimately, heterosis depends on the interactions of specific alleles and epialleles provided by the parents, which is why hybrids can exhibit different levels of heterosis, even within the same species. We characterize the development of several intraspecific Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) F1 hybrids that show different levels of heterosis at maturity. We identify several phases of heterosis beginning during embryogenesis and culminating in a final phase of vegetative maturity and seed production. During each phase, the hybrids show different levels and patterns of growth, despite the close relatedness of the parents. For instance, during the vegetative phases, the hybrids develop larger leaves than the parents to varied extents, and they do so by exploiting increases in cell size and cell numbers in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9464798497127905760", "cites_id": ["9464798497127905760"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/166/1/265/6113314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4Ln1Ixa4WYMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 19, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
