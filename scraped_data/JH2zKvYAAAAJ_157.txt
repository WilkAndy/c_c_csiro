On the day of anthesis the cotton fibre initial cells balloon out from the ovule surface and so are clearly distinguished from adjacent epidermal pavement cells. To enhance our understanding of the molecular processes that determine which cells become fibres and why adjacent epidermal cells remain in a different developmental state we studied the expression profiles of the two respective cell types. Using laser-capture microdissection, coupled with an in vitro RNA amplification system, we used cDNA microarray slides to profile the gene expression in expanding fibre initials compared to the non-expanding epidermal cells at an early stage just after the fibre initials are discernable. Except for a few regulatory genes, the genes that are up \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3298488335868227260", "cites_id": ["3298488335868227260"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00425-007-0580-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vO4xU6qVxi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 10, "2009": 8, "2010": 8, "2011": 10, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
