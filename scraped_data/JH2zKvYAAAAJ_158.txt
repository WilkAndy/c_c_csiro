They are typically highly polymorphic, robust, and often portable, particularly among different mapping populations or crosses and often to related species. They have been useful in species where low levels of genetic diversity limit the use of other markers. Cultivated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) has a history of genetic bottlenecks that have considerably reduced its diversity, with the consequence that most molecular marker genetic linkage studies are done with inter-specific crosses. In this study we evaluated the potential for SSR markers to be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10004714416725574203", "cites_id": ["10004714416725574203"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR04190", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O0IoOMHi14oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 8, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
