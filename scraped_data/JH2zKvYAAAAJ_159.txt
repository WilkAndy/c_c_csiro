Reverse transcription PCR was used to estimate mRNA levels corresponding to particular transcripts. In order to determine if differences in timing or levels of gene activation were likely to account for differences in the susceptibility of Gossypium hirsutum cultivars to Verticillium wilt, we compared the gene activation patterns in the relatively resistant commercial cultivar, Sicala V2 with those exhibited by the susceptible cultivar, CS50. A non-defoliating, Australian isolate of V. dahliae was used and infection was achieved by stem-puncture inoculation with a conidial suspension of the pathogen. Levels of mRNA for genes for cadinene synthase, acidic chitinase, basic chitinase, \u03b2-1,3-glucanase, and at least one \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7488687499369759561", "cites_id": ["7488687499369759561"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885576501903200", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ScPXmZop7WcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
