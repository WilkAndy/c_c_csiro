Crop plants are often grown on soils subject to waterlogging and many are sensitive to waterlogging of the root zone. The combination of unfavourable weather conditions and suboptimal soil and irrigation techniques can result in severe yield losses. The molecular basis of the adaptation to transient low oxygen conditions has not been completely characterized, but progress has been made towards identifying genes and gene products induced during low oxygen conditions. Promoter elements and transcription factors involved in the regulation of anaerobically induced genes have been characterized. In this paper an account is presented of the molecular strategies that have been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 456, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18135243878498824518", "cites_id": ["18135243878498824518"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/51/342/89/485739", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RvH_DDlUrfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 9, "2003": 19, "2004": 4, "2005": 19, "2006": 23, "2007": 30, "2008": 17, "2009": 20, "2010": 27, "2011": 24, "2012": 26, "2013": 26, "2014": 28, "2015": 18, "2016": 26, "2017": 23, "2018": 18, "2019": 25, "2020": 18, "2021": 20, "2022": 20, "2023": 5}}
