She had deduced that both Ac and Ds were small segments of chromosomes that could tranpose from one position to another, that a Ds element could do so only if a functional Ac element was present in the nucleus, and that Ac could itself transpose as well as enabling Ds elements to do so. Mc-Clintock followed the perambulations of these elements by observing their effects on genes controlling readily scoreable phenotypes. Initially, she identified a Ds element in the short arm of chromosome 9 by its property of causing chromosomal breaks that resulted, in the endosperm mitotic divisions, in a succession of dicentric-bridge breakage and reunion cycles. This property of Ds was under the control \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7515331143609425923", "cites_id": ["7515331143609425923"], "pub_url": "http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/49/347.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AyBFcNvRS2gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 3, "1986": 8, "1987": 5, "1988": 11, "1989": 5, "1990": 7, "1991": 3, "1992": 4, "1993": 4, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
