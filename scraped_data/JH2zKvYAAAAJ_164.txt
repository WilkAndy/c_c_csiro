Histone acetylation, a chromatin modification commonly associated with gene transcription, increased on VIN3 chromatin in two spatially and temporally distinct phases in response to low temperatures. During short-term cold exposure, histone H3 acetylation at the transcription start site rapidly increased, implying that it is required for VIN3 induction. Subsequent changes in histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred following continued VIN3 transcription during prolonged cold exposure. Members of the SAGA-like transcriptional adaptor complex, including the histone acetyltransferase GCN5, which induces expression of the cold acclimation pathway genes, do not regulate VIN3 induction during cold exposure, indicating that the cold acclimation pathway and the cold \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=501682166433106900", "cites_id": ["501682166433106900"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205214607553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1MtkuEVV9gYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
