These mutants, however, showed normal seed germination and root growth. One of the sequences flanking Ds, rescued from the mutant, was of a chromosome 4-located putative ent-kaurene synthase (KS) gene, encoding the enzyme catalyzing the second step of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway. Dwarf mutants were always homozygous for this Ds insertion and no normal plants homozygous for this mutation were recovered in the segregating progeny, indicating that the Ds insertion mutation is recessive. As mutations in three recently reported rice GA-responsive dwarf mutant alleles and the dwarf mutation identified in this study mapped to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3452285703792177011", "cites_id": ["3452285703792177011"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00299-004-0896-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cy-xfY776C8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
