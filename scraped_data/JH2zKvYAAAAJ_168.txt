A region between -140 and -99 not only conferred anaerobically inducible expression in the roots of transgenic plants but was also required for expression in the root cap, embryo, and in endosperm under aerobic conditions. GC-rich (GC-1, GC-2, and GC-3) or GT-rich (GT-1 and GT-2) sequence motifs in this region were necessary for expression in these tissues, as they were in anaerobic expression. Expression in the root cap under aerobic conditions required all the GC- and GT-rich motifs. The GT-1, GC-1, GC-2, and GC-3 motifs, and to a lesser extent the GT-2 motif, were also required for anaerobic responsiveness in rice \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5991871802298300743", "cites_id": ["5991871802298300743"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/6/6/799/5984716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R3mra6hnJ1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 6, "1996": 3, "1997": 7, "1998": 2, "1999": 9, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
