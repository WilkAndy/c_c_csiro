A novel durum wheat, Line 149, was found to contain a major gene for Na+ exclusion, Nax2, which removes Na+ from the xylem in the roots and leads to a high K+-to-Na+ ratio in the leaves. Nax2 was mapped to the distal region on chromosome 5AL based on linkage to microsatellite markers. The Nax2 locus on 5AL coincides with the locus for a putative Na+ transporter, HKT1;5 (HKT8). The Nax2 region on 5AL is homoeologous to the region on chromosome 4DL containing the major Na+ exclusion locus in bread wheat, Kna1. A gene member of the HKT1;5 family colocates to the deletion bin containing Kna1 on chromosome 4DL. This work provides evidence that Nax2 and Kna1 are strongly associated with HKT1;5 genes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 449, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9775767492151950687", "cites_id": ["9775767492151950687"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/143/4/1918/6106880", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Xz2HaL2AqocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 11, "2008": 16, "2009": 21, "2010": 30, "2011": 24, "2012": 25, "2013": 30, "2014": 22, "2015": 21, "2016": 27, "2017": 26, "2018": 45, "2019": 45, "2020": 39, "2021": 24, "2022": 29, "2023": 10}}
