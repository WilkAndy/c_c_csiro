Analysis of the upstream sequences of the aldolase gene reveals a six base-pair sequence (TGGTTT) with perfect homology to one of the sub-regions of the anaerobic regulatory element (ARE) which is responsible for the anaerobic induction of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase 1 gene (Adh1). In the aldolase gene this sequence is located at position \u2014 70 relative to the start of transcription, in a small segment proven by functional analysis to be important for expression of the aldolase gene. Since this six base-pair sequence has been shown to be critical for anaerobic induction of the Adh1 mRNA, is in the functional promoter region of aldolase and is also present in a homologous position in Adh2 (another anaerobically-induced gene), we suggest this hexanucleotide is essential for anaerobic regulation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12599859088687516705", "cites_id": ["12599859088687516705"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283688905566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IUwykRWx264J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 5, "1990": 6, "1991": 6, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 7, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
