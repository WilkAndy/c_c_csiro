Heterosis is particularly important in the production systems of major crops. Recent studies have suggested that epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation is involved in heterosis, but the molecular mechanism of heterosis is still unclear. To address the epigenetic contribution to heterosis in Arabidopsis thaliana, we used mutant genes that have roles in DNA methylation. Hybrids between C24 and Columbia-0 (Col) without RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) or methyltransferase I (MET1) function did not reduce the level of biomass heterosis (as evaluated by rosette diameter). Hybrids with a mutation in decrease in dna methylation 1 (ddm1) showed a decreased heterosis level. Vegetative heterosis in the ddm1 mutant hybrid was reduced but not eliminated; a complete reduction could result if there was a change in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10785378144166922875", "cites_id": ["10785378144166922875"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1613372113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e8pUW0dcrZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 12, "2018": 13, "2019": 8, "2020": 17, "2021": 10, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
