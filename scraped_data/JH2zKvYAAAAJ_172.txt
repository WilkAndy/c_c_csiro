The selectable markers were those coding for the enzymes neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT*) for kanamycin resistance, hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) for hygromycin resistance, phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase (PAT) for resistance to the herbicidal compound phosphinothricin, and a mutant acetolactate synthase (ALS) for resistance to sulfonylurea herbicides. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into wheat and rice protoplasts by electroporation. Wheat protoplast-derived callus lines producing NPT and PAT were selected with kanamycin and phosphinothricin respectively. Wheat callus transformed with the gene coding for the mutant ALS was selected with sulfometuron methyl following the bombardment of suspension cultures with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 76, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17769101266077668712", "cites_id": ["17769101266077668712"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9940095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aNWA7nSHmPYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 5, "1995": 5, "1996": 3, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 9, "2000": 6, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
