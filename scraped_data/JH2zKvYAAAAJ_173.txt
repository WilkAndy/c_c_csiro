A transformation system has been developed for both T. flavus and the related T. macrosporus and has been used to create Talaromyces spp. which either over-express or are deficient in glucose oxidase. In vitro inhibition experiments on Verticillium dahliae using culture filtrates from these transformants indicates that secreted glucose oxidase is responsible for a large part of the growth inhibition of V. dahliae microsclerotia and hyphae by T. flavus, although other inhibitory compounds may also play a role. In pot trials with cotton plants, both Talaromyces species had some biocontrol activity, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of Verticillium wilt with either the presence or absence of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16580825672242065986", "cites_id": ["16580825672242065986"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002940050290", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QnKqlBntGuYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
