Each gene is characterised by an intron arrangement similar to that of both maize Adh1 and Adh2, although two genes show an exon fusion. A comparison with the maize coding sequences unambiguously assorts the barley loci into an Adh1-like gene and two Adh2-like genes, indicating that an ancient gene duplication underlies the widespread occurrence of two Adh loci in higher plants. In the barley lineage there has been a further duplication-transposition of a progenitor \u201cAdh2\u201d locus to give rise to the extant three-gene system, with gene copies of different ancestry being closely linked. An Adh1 null-allele, Adh1-M9, has been cloned; the available sequence includes an intron with a missing acceptor splice signal.
