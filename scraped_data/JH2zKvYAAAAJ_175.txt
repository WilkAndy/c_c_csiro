In Arabidopsis the principle processes altering the hybrid methylome are Trans Chromosomal Methylation (TCM) and Trans Chromosomal deMethylation (TCdM) in which the mC pattern of a genomic segment attains the same mC pattern of the corresponding segment on the other parental chromosome. We examined two loci that undergo TCM/TCdM in the Arabidopsis C24/Landsberg erecta (Ler) F1 hybrids, which show patterns of inheritance dependent on the properties of the particular donor and recipient chromosomal segments. At At1g64790 the TCM- and TCdM-derived mC patterns are maintained in the F2 generation but are transmitted in outcrosses or backcrosses only by the C24 genomic segment.
