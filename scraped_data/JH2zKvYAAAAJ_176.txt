In the maize BMS cell line the dominant ocs\u2010element binding activity is the ocs\u2010element transcription factor complex called OTF. The isolation of cDNA clones from a BMS cDNA expression library for two bZIP (basic region\u2010leucine zipper) proteins that bind the ocs\u2010element sequence and are good candidates for forming at least part of OTF is described. The two ocs\u2010element binding proteins, called OBF3.1 and OBF3.2, are closely related, with the OBF3.1 protein sharing 95.8% amino acid homology with part of the OBF3.2 protein although there were significant differences in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions. Genomic Southern blot analysis revealed a small gene family with a minimum of two OBF3 loci mapping to chromosomes 3L 105 and 8L075. The OBF3.1 protein shared considerable homology with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5453772374648897442", "cites_id": ["5453772374648897442"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.1993.00669.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oj_JVBSxr0sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 8, "1995": 8, "1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 6, "1999": 5, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
