Degenerate oligonucleotide mutagenesis provided single base substitutions at every position in the element and a number of multiple base substitutions. The effects of these changes were determined in transient expression assays with tobacco and maize protoplasts. The majority of single and double base changes had little effect on the activity of the octopine synthase enhancer, but nearly all mutants with more than two base changes had low to essentially no activity. There were five positions where particular single base changes resulted in a 4- to 10-fold loss in enhancer activity. The distribution of these positions within the palindrome was asymmetric. Single base deletions had essentially no activity, demonstrating that the octopine synthase enhancer cannot tolerate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16227554639352409761", "cites_id": ["16227554639352409761"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.86.10.3733", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oa7Xm_faM-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 4, "1990": 9, "1991": 5, "1992": 8, "1993": 9, "1994": 8, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
