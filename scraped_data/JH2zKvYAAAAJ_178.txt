While transformed plants were recovered using the bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase) gene in combination with bialaphos, and the aphA (neomycin phosphotransferase) gene in combination with geneticin or paromomycin, no transgenic material was obtained with the hpt (hygromycin phosphotransferase) gene and hygromycin B. Southern analysis revealed single copy as well as multiple copy insertions of the bar and aphA transgenes. Inheritance of these selectable marker genes was demonstrated in the T1 generation progenies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9852379159619584700", "cites_id": ["9852379159619584700"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP97095", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vEKWQaWuuogJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 6, "2001": 9, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
