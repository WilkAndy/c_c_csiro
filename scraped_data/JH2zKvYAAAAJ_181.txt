Their presence in non-nodulating plants raises the possibility that haemoglobins might serve a function in non-symbiotic tissues distinct from their role in the nitrogen-fixing root nodules induced by micro-organisms. We report here that a P. andersonii haemoglobin promoter can regulate expression of either the P. andersonii haemoglobin gene, or a hybrid construct with the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat), in the nonsymbiotic plant, Nicotiana tabacum. Expression is predominantly in the roots, implying that haemoglobins might have a function in roots of non-nodulated plants. We have also observed a low level of haemoglobin protein in non-nodulated P. andersonii roots, but not leaves, supporting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7278458914500411799", "cites_id": ["7278458914500411799"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00340181", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l4ES39FHAmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 5, "1991": 4, "1992": 5, "1993": 5, "1994": 4, "1995": 2, "1996": 9, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 7, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
