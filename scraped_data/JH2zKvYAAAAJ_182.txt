We found that hypoxic conditions also induce VIN3 in a quantitative manner but high salt, high temperatures and osmotic stress do not. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration did not induce VIN3 expression, consistent with the lack of VIN3 induction in response to other stresses that affect the rate of mitochondrial respiration. De novo protein synthesis is required for VIN3 induction during hypoxic conditions; this situation is not the case for VIN3 induction by low temperatures, indicating that different mechanisms act to induce VIN3 expression in response to cold and hypoxic conditions. Without VIN3 activity, fewer seedlings survived following a 72\u2010h period of hypoxic treatment, indicating that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5840555639992091223", "cites_id": ["5840555639992091223"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03891.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VwKi9GjSDVEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 10, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
