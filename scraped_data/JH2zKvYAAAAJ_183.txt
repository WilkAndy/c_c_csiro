Whereas the specific growth rate of untransformed hairy roots in shake flasks and in a multiple\u2010tube recirculation bioreactor declined significantly with decreasing oxygen tension down to 25% air saturation, growth of the transformant root lines was maintained at rates similar to those achieved with full aeration. This work demonstrates that altering the expression of selected genes involved in anaerobic metabolism can alleviate the problems of oxygen deficiency in hairy root cultures caused by poor mixing and mass transfer conditions. \u00a9 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
