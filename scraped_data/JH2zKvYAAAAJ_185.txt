The 35S line accumulated the loop of the hpRNA, in contrast to full-length hpRNA in the Pol III line. These suggest that Pol II and Pol III-transcribed hpRNAs are processed by different pathways. One Pol III transgene produced only 24-nt siRNAs but silenced the target gene efficiently, indicating that the 24-nt siRNAs can direct mRNA degradation; specific cleavage was confirmed by 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Both Pol II- and Pol III-directed hpRNA transgenes induced cytosine methylation in the target DNA. The extent of methylation is not correlated with the level of 21-nt siRNAs, suggesting that they are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15818953282857110471", "cites_id": ["15818953282857110471"], "pub_url": "https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/14/5/903.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x4syxzI2iNsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
