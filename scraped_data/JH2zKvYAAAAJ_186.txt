Repression of FLC occurs in response to prolonged cold exposure (vernalization) and is associated with an enrichment of the repressive histone modification trimethylated H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and a depletion of the active histone modification H3K4me3 at FLC chromatin. In two cases genes adjacent to FLC are also repressed by vernalization. NEOMYCIN PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE II (NPTII) adjacent to an FLC transgene is repressed by vernalization, and this is associated with an increase in H3K27me3, demonstrating that the epigenetic repression of FLC can confer a repressed epigenetic state to an adjacent transcription unit. The second case involves the two genes adjacent to the endogenous FLC gene, UPSTREAM OF FLC (UFC) and DOWNSTREAM OF FLC (DFC). Both genes are repressed by vernalization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=787974641823336260", "cites_id": ["787974641823336260"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03883.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:REflCcNy7woJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 10, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
