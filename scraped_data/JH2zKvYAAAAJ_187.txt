In this system, a Ds containing T-DNA construct was used to produce Ds launch pad lines. Callus tissues, from single-copy Ds/T-DNA lines, were then transiently infected with Agrobacterium harbouring an immobile Ac (iAc) construct, also containing a green fluorescent protein gene (sgfpS65T) as the visual marker. We have regenerated stable Ds insertion lines at a frequency of 9\u201313% using selection for Ds excision and GFP counter selection against iAc and nearly half of them were unique insertion lines. Double transformants (iAc/Ds) were also obtained and their progeny yielded ~10% stable insertion lines following excision and visual marker screening with 50 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7962688300714297830", "cites_id": ["7962688300714297830"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-006-0235-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5gk8RdImgW4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
