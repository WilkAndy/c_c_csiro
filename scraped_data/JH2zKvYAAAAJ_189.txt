How PSTVd induces disease symptoms is a long standing question. It has been suggested that PSTVd-derived small RNAs (sRNAs) could direct RNA silencing of a targeted host gene(s) resulting in symptom development. To test this, we expressed PSTVd sequences as artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) in Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana benthamiana. One amiRNA, amiR46 that corresponds to sequences within the PSTVd virulence modulating region (VMR), induced abnormal phenotypes in both Nicotiana species that closely resemble those displayed by PSTVd infected plants. In N. tabacum amiR46 plants, phenotype severity correlated with amiR46 accumulation and expression down-regulation of the bioinformatically-identified target gene, a Nicotiana soluble \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15068267609199450346", "cites_id": ["15068267609199450346"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221300682X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6pjbMo49HdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 7}}
