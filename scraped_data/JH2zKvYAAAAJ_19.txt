Generating larger amounts of sequence data more quickly does not address the difficulties of sequencing and assembling complex genomes de novo. The cotton (Gossypium spp.) genomes represent a challenging case. To this end, a coalition of cotton genome scientists has developed a strategy for sequencing the cotton genomes, which will vastly expand opportunities for cotton research and improvement worldwide."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 431, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13660965877741882165", "cites_id": ["13660965877741882165"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/145/4/1303/6107067", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NYuJPxaAlb0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 7, "2009": 18, "2010": 14, "2011": 21, "2012": 23, "2013": 14, "2014": 11, "2015": 28, "2016": 34, "2017": 34, "2018": 42, "2019": 32, "2020": 35, "2021": 50, "2022": 51, "2023": 13}}
