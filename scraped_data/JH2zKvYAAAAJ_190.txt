To identify a resistance (R) gene against Fusarium yellows in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. pekinensis), we analyzed differential expression at the whole genome level between resistant and susceptible inbred lines using RNA sequencing. Four hundred and eighteen genes were significantly differentially expressed, and these were enriched for genes involved in response to stress or stimulus. Seven dominant DNA markers at putative R-genes were identified. Presence and absence of the sequence of the putative R-genes, Bra012688 and Bra012689, correlated with the resistance of six inbred lines and susceptibility of four inbred lines, respectively. In F2 populations derived from crosses between resistant and susceptible inbred lines, presence of Bra012688 and Bra012689 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2755186656462579646", "cites_id": ["2755186656462579646"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11103-014-0182-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vidZnKpjPCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
