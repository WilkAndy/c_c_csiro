These phenotypes are similar to those of the FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) class mutants, mea, fis2, fie, and Atmsi1, which also show development of the central cell into endosperm in the absence of fertilization and arrest of the embryo following fertilization. Atubp26 results from a T-DNA insertion in the UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE gene AtUBP26, which catalyzes deubiquitination of histone H2B and is required for heterochromatin silencing. The paternal copy of AtUBP26 is able to complement the loss of function of the maternal copy in postfertilization seed development. This contrasts to the fis class mutants where the paternal FIS copy does not rescue aborted seeds. As in the fis class mutants \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15688084897674381112", "cites_id": ["15688084897674381112"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/180/1/229/6105093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OEcNbBhGt9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
