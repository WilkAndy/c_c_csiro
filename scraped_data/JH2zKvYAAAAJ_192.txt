Two protein-DNA complexes are distinguishable by electrophoretic mobility in gel retardation assays. Footprint analyses of these low and high molecular weight complexes show, respectively, half and complete protection of the ocs-element DNA from cleavage by methidiumpropyl-EDTA.FE(II). Two lines of evidence indicate that the element has two recognition sites, each of which can bind identical protein units. Elements that are mutated in one or the other half and form only the low molecular weight complex interfere with the formation of both the low and high molecular weight complexes by the wild-type element. Protein isolated from a complex with only one binding site occupied can bind to the wild-type ocs-element and generate complexes with protein \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3419278578961981455", "cites_id": ["3419278578961981455"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/2/3/215/5970422", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D6AhX8C3cy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 7, "1992": 5, "1993": 6, "1994": 9, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
