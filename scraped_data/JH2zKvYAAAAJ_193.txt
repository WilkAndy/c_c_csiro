To survive sub\u2010zero winter temperatures, plants must first acclimate to low, non\u2010freezing temperatures (cold acclimation). Induction of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), the first gene in the vernalization pathway, is initiated within the same time frame as the induction of genes in the cold acclimation pathway raising the question of whether there are common elements in the signal transduction pathways that activate these two responses to cold. We show that none of the signalling components required for cold acclimation, including the \u2018master regulator\u2019INDUCTION OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE1) or HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 (HOS1), which has been described as a link between cold acclimation and vernalization, play a role in VIN3 induction. We also show that the hormone abscisic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6166203948124566102", "cites_id": ["6166203948124566102"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02370.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VnKTJNLBklUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
