Black Mexican sweet) cells by electroporation. Transformation frequencies of 7.6\u00d710-4 and 8\u00d710-4, respectively, (based on the number of surviving cells that divided) were obtained with four pulses of 1 ms duration using 400 V capacitive discharge. Cells transformed to kanamycin-resistance and hygromycin-resistance subsequently multiplied to form callus. Southern blot analysis demonstrated the integration of the selectable marker genes, neomycin or hygromycin phosphotransferase, with single or multiple copy numbers. The blots from DNA of hygromycin-resistant calli also suggested the formation of plasmid concatemers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15227999625296331089", "cites_id": ["15227999625296331089"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00043398", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UcGRUfq4VNMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 5, "1995": 5, "1996": 3, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
