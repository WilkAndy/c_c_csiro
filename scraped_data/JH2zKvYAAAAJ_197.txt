Both genes contain eight introns in exactly the same positions, and these positions are conserved in plant ethanolactive Adh genes (class P). These data provide further evidence that plant class P genes have evolved from class III genes by gene duplication and acquisition of new substrate specificities. The position of introns and similarities in the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the different classes of ADH enzymes in plants and humans suggest that plant and animal class I11 enzymes diverged before they duplicated to give rise to plant and animal ethanol-active ADH enzymes. Plant class P ADH enzymes have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2325701559797228820", "cites_id": ["2325701559797228820"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/146/3/1131/6053962", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FCVJHT-NRiAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 3}}
