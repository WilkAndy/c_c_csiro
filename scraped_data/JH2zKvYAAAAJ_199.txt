To increase the levels of ribozyme and control antisense in vivo, sequences were expressed from an autonomously replicating vector derived from African cassava mosaic geminivirus. In vitro, the nonembedded ribozyme cleaved more target RNA, encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), than the tRNA(Tyr) ribozyme. In contrast, the tRNA(Tyr) ribozyme was considerably more effective in vivo than either the nonembedded ribozyme or antisense sequences, reducing CAT activity to < 20% of the control level. A target sequence (CM2), mutated to be noncleavable, showed no reduction in CAT activity in the presence of the tRNA(Tyr) ribozyme beyond that for the antisense construct.
