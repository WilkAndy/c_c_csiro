Here we show that an abrupt five- to sixfold ploidy increase approximately 60\u2009million years (Myr) ago, and allopolyploidy reuniting divergent Gossypium genomes approximately 1\u20132 Myr ago, conferred about 30\u201336-fold duplication of ancestral angiosperm (flowering plant) genes in elite cottons (Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense), genetic complexity equalled only by Brassica among sequenced angiosperms. Nascent fibre evolution, before allopolyploidy, is elucidated by comparison of spinnable-fibred Gossypium herbaceum A and non-spinnable Gossypium longicalyx F genomes to one another and the outgroup D genome of non-spinnable Gossypium raimondii.
