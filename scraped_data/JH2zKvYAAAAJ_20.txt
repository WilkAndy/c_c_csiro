The 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA gene repeat units in hexaploid wheat (cv. Chinese Spring) are on chromosomes 1B, 6B and 5D. In rye (cv. Imperial) the repeat units occur at a single site on chromosome 1R(E), while in barley (cv. Clipper) they are on both the chromosomes (6 and 7) which show secondary constrictions. In wheat and rye the major 5S RNA gene sites are close to the cytological secondary constrictions where the 18S-5.8S-26S repeating units are found, but in barley the site is on a chromosome not carrying the other rDNA sequences. \u2014 Restriction enzyme and R-loop analyses showed the 18S-5.8S-26S repeating units to be approximately 9.5 kb long in wheat, 9.0 kb in rye and barley to have two repeat lengths of 9.5 kb and 10 kb.
