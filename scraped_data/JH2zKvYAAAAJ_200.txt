The yield advantage of the F1 is lost in the F2 and subsequent generations. In Arabidopsis, from F2 plants that have a F1-like phenotype, we have by recurrent selection produced pure breeding F5/F6 lines, hybrid mimics, in which the characteristics of the F1 hybrid are stabilized. These hybrid mimic lines, like the F1 hybrid, have larger leaves than the parent plant, and the leaves have increased photosynthetic cell numbers, and in some lines, increased size of cells, suggesting an increased supply of photosynthate. A comparison of the differentially expressed genes in the F1 hybrid with those of eight hybrid mimic lines identified metabolic pathways altered in both; these pathways include down-regulation of defense response pathways and altered abiotic response pathways \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7830854464170121365", "cites_id": ["7830854464170121365"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1514190112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lVikQKXIrGwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
