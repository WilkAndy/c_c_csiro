Plants respond to low oxygen through rapid and specific changes at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Transcriptional changes to low-oxygen (hypoxia) stress have been studied in a number of plant species using whole genome microarrays. Using transcriptome data from root tissue from early time points (4-5 h) from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), Arabidopsis and gray poplar (Populus x canescens), we have identified a core set of orthologous genes that responded to hypoxia in similar ways between species, and others that showed species specific responses . Responses to hypoxia were most similar between Arabidopsis and cotton, while the waterlogging tolerant poplar species exhibited some significant differences."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13522476679973985349", "cites_id": ["13522476679973985349"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/psb.5.8.12231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RVxaMeV8qbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
