While long non-coding RNAs have been most extensively studied in animal species, studies of long non-coding RNA in plants begin to emerge showing some conservation of mechanisms. This review aims to provide an overview of significant and recently identified long non-coding RNA-mediated mechanisms in both animal and plant species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14904361980050279740", "cites_id": ["14904361980050279740"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/rna.8.3.14382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PA28EEHu1s4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
