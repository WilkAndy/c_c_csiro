For both Ac (Schwartz & Dennis 1986) and Spm (Fedoroff et al. 1988) methylation of a region upstream and downstream of the site of initiation of transcription results in a loss both of mRNA encoding for the transposase and the ability to excise. We have studied the activation of an inactive, methylated derivative of Ac by using a cycle of tissue culture. A passage through tissue culture results in activation of the element and is correlated with demethylation of the 5' end of the transposase gene. Demethylation and activation may occur as a multistep process. We propose a model in which binding of the Ac transposase to the 5' region of the Ac element prevents methylation following replication. Consequently, demethylation and reactivation occurs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15723807491070337388", "cites_id": ["15723807491070337388"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1990.0006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bKHf1ZovNtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 6, "1992": 3, "1993": 8, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
