This T\u2010DNA/Ds construct contains: Ds terminal sequences immediately inside T\u2010DNA borders for subsequent Ds mobilization; promoterless green fluorescent protein (sgfpS65T) and \u03b2\u2010glucuronidase (uidA) reporter genes, each fused to an intron (from Arabidopsis GPA1 gene) to enable bidirectional gene trapping by T\u2010DNA or Ds; an ampicillin resistance gene (bla) and a bacterial origin of replication (ori) to serve as the plasmid rescue system; an intron\u2010containing hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hph) as a selectable marker or Ds tracer; and an intron\u2010containing barnase gene in the binary vector backbone (VB) to select against transformants carrying unwanted VB sequences.
