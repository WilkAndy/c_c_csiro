Earlier we described a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, amp1, that had five times higher levels of cytokinin and had a number of pleiotropic phenotypes, including increased cell proliferation and de-etiolated growth in the dark. While these phenotypes were correlated with higher levels of cytokinin, the actual mechanism of how cytokinin is elevated was not elucidated before. In order to understand if the increased cytokinin is a result of increased biosynthesis or decreased degradation we have compared the synthesis of cytokinins from radiolabelled adenine and the degradation of zeatin ribosides and other cytokinins between amp1 and wild type plants. The degradation of the hormone is not affected in the mutant but there is a 4 to 6 fold increase in cytokinin synthesis compared to the wild type. Because the amp1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15960400230854665075", "cites_id": ["15960400230854665075"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010720420637", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c6MnuXK7ft0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
