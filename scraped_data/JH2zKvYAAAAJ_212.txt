This contrasts with the expression of both the P. andersonii hemoglobin protein in P. andersonii nodules and the endogenous Lotus leghemoglobins that are expressed in the infected cells at very high levels. The expression pattern of the P. andersonii and T. tomentosa hemoglobin promoters in L. corniculatus resembles that of a nonsymbiotic hemoglobin gene from Casuarina glauca, which was introduced into this legume, and suggests that only the nonsymbiotic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16039312774973786571", "cites_id": ["16039312774973786571"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/113/1/45/6070898", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y4myKf0Vl94J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 7, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
