We know about key genetic controls repressing or stimulating the cascades of gene expression that move a plant through stages in its life cycle, facilitating the morphogenesis of vegetative and reproductive tissues and organs. The new technologies are enabling the identification of key gene activity responses to the range of biotic and abiotic challenges experienced by plants. In the past, plant breeders produced new varieties with changes in the phases of development, modifications of plant architecture and improved levels of tolerance and resistance to environmental and biotic challenges by identifying the required phenotypes in a few plants among the large numbers of plants in a breeding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8441178762455325741", "cites_id": ["8441178762455325741"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2007.2172", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LZy4dVwXJXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
