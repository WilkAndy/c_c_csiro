Four independent transgenic lines transformed with the cotton Adh2 cDNA driven by the CaMV 35S promoter showed ectopic expression of this isozyme in leaves and up to 20-fold greater in vitro ADH activity in roots. Under conditions of O2 deficiency, excised roots from these transgenic plants showed up to 80% increase in ethanol evolution compared to untransformed roots. Conversely, one line transformed with a construct containing the Adh2 coding region in the antisense orientation showed a 65% decrease in ADH activity and a 25% decrease in ethanol production from anaerobic roots relative to untransformed cotton.
