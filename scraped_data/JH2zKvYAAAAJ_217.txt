Millewa. Southern analysis using cv. Chinese Spring nullisomic\u2013tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines established that the cloned gene mapped to the long arm of chromosome 1A and does not correspond to any previously identified wheat Adh locus. Southern analysis also provided evidence for triplicate copies of this Adh gene on the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, while Northern blots indicated that the homoeologous group 1 Adh genes, like several other plant Adh genes, are transcribed under anaerobic conditions. Sequence analysis indicates that the cloned gene has a structure similar to both monocot and dicot Adh genes with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 379 amino acids. Sequences important for eucaryotic gene expression such as the TATA box \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2271671829708713908", "cites_id": ["2271671829708713908"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/g89-454", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tK8MSH6Zhh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 5, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
