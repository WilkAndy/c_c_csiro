These phylads appear to have originated independently by hybridization between the precursors of the present day bisexual species \u201cP169\u201d and \u201cP196\u201d. The clones of the Standard phylad of W. virgo have their 18S+26S rDNA cistrons located in C-bands 4, 44 and 49, while those of the Boulder-Zanthus phylad have them in C-bands 50, 74 and 87.5. The relative numbers of the ribosomal genes at the different sites vary greatly from clone to clone and are closely correlated with the width of the corresponding C- and N-bands. Site 49 of the ribosomal cistrons is present as a separate band in the eastern race \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13266794715163096834", "cites_id": ["13266794715163096834"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00294964", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AndTwYAfHbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 3, "1985": 5, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
