Conserved cleavage was observed in 6% of the LB and 43% of the RB. Terminal microhomology (1\u201310bp) was identified in 58% of T-DNA/rice, 43% of T-DNA/T-DNA and 82% of T-DNA/VB junctions, and this occurred particularly at the LB junctions. Approximately 32% of both T-DNA/rice and T-DNA/T-DNA junctions harboured 1\u2013344bp of filler DNA that was derived mainly from the T-DNA region adjacent to the breakpoint and/or from the rice genome flanking the T-DNA integration site. Structure of the filler DNA was more complicated at the T-DNA/T-DNA junction than at the T-DNA/rice junction, indicating the presence of T \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7933747515096595825", "cites_id": ["7933747515096595825"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168945206001014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cX34hlRVGm4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
