While fewer than 0.1% of the seedlings of wild\u2010type plants are non\u2010dicot as many as 20% of the seedlings of the amp1 mutant are tricot or tetracot. The rate of leaf initiation is faster and vegetative phyllotaxy is altered in amp1. When grown in the dark amp1 seedlings show morphogenetic properties similar to light\u2010grown wild\u2010type plants: they do not form an apical hook, have hypocotyls shorter than wild\u2010type plants and form etiolated true leaves. amp1 mutant flowers significantly earlier than congenic Amp1 plants. The mutant has six times more cytokinin than wild\u2010type suggesting that endogenous cytokinin levels might play an important role in mediating these different developmental processes. AMP1 might code for a negative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 412, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14766809640145731547", "cites_id": ["14766809640145731547"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.04060907.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2z-zOiE_7swJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 8, "1995": 10, "1996": 17, "1997": 26, "1998": 24, "1999": 18, "2000": 16, "2001": 16, "2002": 19, "2003": 16, "2004": 24, "2005": 18, "2006": 17, "2007": 14, "2008": 18, "2009": 21, "2010": 10, "2011": 9, "2012": 11, "2013": 25, "2014": 13, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
