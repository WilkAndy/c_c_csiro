Pedigree records suggest that the source of this resistance was a set of related, so-called immune lines carrying the B2B3B7 and BSm genes. However, resistance to Xcm race 18 segregates as a single dominant locus in at least one Australian cultivar (CS50), so its true identity is unclear. Our study uses mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers to investigate the chromosomal location of Xcm resistance in an Australian cultivar of Gossypium hirsutum (CS50) in an inter-specific cross with a blight-susceptible Gossypium barbadense (Pima S-7). The mapping data suggest that the resistance locus is not on chromosome 20 near either the B2 or B3 genes, but co-segregates with a marker on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9247356515840948372", "cites_id": ["9247356515840948372"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/AR01121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lPgXrsE1VYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
