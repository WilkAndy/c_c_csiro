Leghemoglobin genes have been characterized in many legumes [7], most extensively in soybean [4, 6, 10, 15].However, hemoglobin (Hb) genes from several non-legumes have also been characterized: thus, in the U| macea Parasponia a single Hb gene is expressed in root nodules formed after infection with rhizobium bacteria [12, 13]. This gene is also expressed in non-nodulated roots [3]. In addition, a Hb gene has been characterized in the closely related genus Trema, which does not form root nodules. This gene is also expressed at both RNA and protein level [3]. We report here the isolation and characterization of a hemoglobin gene from the actinorhizoid dicotyledonous angiosperm, Casuarina glauca, which forms a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1742989664632529515", "cites_id": ["1742989664632529515"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00020566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a2KZf91XMBgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3}}
