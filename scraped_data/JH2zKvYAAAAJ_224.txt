To further our understanding of these genes and the flowering process, the vegetative molecular phenotypes of 16 Arabidopsis mutants associated with the major flowering initiation pathways were assayed using a 13,000 clone microarray under two different conditions that affect flowering. All mutants showed at least one change in gene expression other than the mutant flowering gene. Metabolism- and defence-related pathways were the areas with the most frequent gene expression changes detected in the mutants. Several genes such as EARLI1 were differentially expressed in a number of flowering mutants from different flowering pathways. Analysis of the promoter regions of genes differentially expressed identified common promoter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10987245090731905745", "cites_id": ["10987245090731905745"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/46/8/1190/1875062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0dI6dTKJepgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
