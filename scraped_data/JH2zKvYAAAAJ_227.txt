Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 41-60, 1981", "author": "WJ Peacock and WL Gerlach and ES Dennis", "journal": "Wheat Science-Today and Tomorrow. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge", "pages": "41-60", "abstract": "Polyploid wheats are of two basic types\u2013hexaploids with 21 pairs of chromosomes and tetraploids with 14 pairs of chromosomes. Cytogenetic analysis has established that the two genomes (A and B) of tetraploid wheat are different but homoeologous. Each has 7 pairs of chromosomes. These two genomes occur in the hexaploid wheats together with an additional genome (D), again of 7 pairs of chromosomes. The different genomes have become associated through hybridization events between different diploid species of grasses, the progenitors of the modern wheats.Geneticists have been interested in identifying the diploid species which hybridized to form polyploid wheats not only because the evolution of cultivat-ed wheats is closely associated with the social evolution of man, but also because knowledge of the progenitor species could be of importance in facilitating the introduction of genes into modern agricultural cultivars. Furthermore, the transition from diploid to tetraploid and hexaploid chromosome levels provides us with an opportunity to analyse and document changes that occur in plant genomes under the intense selection pressures associated with the development of agricultural crops."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7032706393724073994", "cites_id": ["7032706393724073994"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HEQ9AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA41&dq=info:CriKRzQxmWEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=2QCcY1ljB1&sig=a1zgPsd888ucSK71caEw-FjPunI", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CriKRzQxmWEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 5, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3}}
