These sequence elements, designated anaerobic regula tory elements, confer inducibility by anaerobic condi tions on downstress plant-expressible promoters and their associated structural genes. In particular, those sequences associated with anaerobic induction of the maize alcohol dehydrogenase and aldolase genes have been identified. These sequence elements can be em ployed in combination with appropriately positioned plant-expressible genes to produce chimeric, anaerobi cally inducible genes. Such constructs are useful for the selective expression of structural genes under anaerobic conditions in plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4520022525963933828", "cites_id": ["4520022525963933828"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US5001060A/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hBjYDIpYuj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
