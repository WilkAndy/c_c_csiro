Of the C mallele 6 kb was sequenced. A single amino acid substitution of aspartate for tyrosine at residue 52 accounts for the altered enzymatic properties of the C mprotein. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence to that of Adh1-1F and Adh1-1S shows structural and restriction site polymorphisms in the 3\u2032 flanking DNA. C mlacks the insertion sequence present in 1F and 1S and contains a complex sequence composed of two direct repeats and an inverted repeat. The two genes of the duplication allele have similar restriction maps to C mand each other."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17987134425008962432", "cites_id": ["17987134425008962432"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00016138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gPvbqXUjn_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 6, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
