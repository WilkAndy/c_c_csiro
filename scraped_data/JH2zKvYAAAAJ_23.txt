We have investigated the relationships between gibberellins (GAs), theseGAMYB-like genes, and petiole elongation and flowering of Arabidopsis. Within 1 to 2 d of transferring plants from short- to long-day photoperiods, growth rate and erectness of petioles increased, and there were morphological changes at the shoot apex associated with the transition to flowering. These responses were accompanied by accumulation of GAs in the petioles (GA1 by 11-fold and GA4 by 3-fold), and an increase in expression of AtMYB33 at the shoot apex. Inhibition of GA biosynthesis using paclobutrazol blocked the petiole elongation induced by long days. Causality was suggested by the finding that, with GA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 395, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13920944802329048166", "cites_id": ["13920944802329048166"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/127/4/1682/6103615", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZrSkmIohMcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 6, "2003": 14, "2004": 17, "2005": 18, "2006": 23, "2007": 18, "2008": 21, "2009": 16, "2010": 22, "2011": 18, "2012": 18, "2013": 19, "2014": 27, "2015": 21, "2016": 14, "2017": 21, "2018": 18, "2019": 19, "2020": 13, "2021": 22, "2022": 22, "2023": 6}}
