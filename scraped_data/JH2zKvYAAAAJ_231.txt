They are characterized by a highly conserved MADS-box domain of 59 amino acids that binds to specific DNA sequences. We report the characterization of a cDNA clone, ETL (Eucalyptus TM3 Like), from Eucalyptus globulus subspecies bicostata encoding a putative transcription factor of the MADS-box class that is strongly expressed in both vegetative and floral tissues, suggesting that it regulates processes other than floral development. The clone was isolated from a floral bud cDNA library with a probe generated from Eucalyptus genomic DNA by PCR using degenerate primers to the MADS-box of the floral regulatory gene APETALA 1. The ETL cDNA clone encodes a putative protein of 206 amino acids that contains an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2221169156112216475", "cites_id": ["2221169156112216475"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111998006131", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m3EfSJQt0x4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
