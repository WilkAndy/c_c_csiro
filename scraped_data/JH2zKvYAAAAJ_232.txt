The steady state level of              Adhl             -specific transcript is reduced to about 1% that of the progenitor or revertant alleles. Run-on transcription studies show that the reduced level of              Adhl              specific mRNA is not attributable to a decreased transcription rate. SI mapping indicates that the              Ds              element is spliced from the              Adh1-Fm335              transcript using a donor site 14 bp into the              Ds              element and an acceptor site at the 3\u2032 junction of the              Ds              element with the flanking genome DNA.
