Driving the changes in methylation are the processes trans-chromosomal methylation (TCM) and trans-chromosomal demethylation (TCdM). In TCM/TCdM the methylation state of one allele is altered to resemble the other allele. We show that Pol IV-dependent sRNAs are required to establish TCM events. The changes in DNA methylation and the associated changes in sRNA levels in the F1 hybrid can be maintained in subsequent generations and affect hundreds of regions in the F2 epigenome. The inheritance of these altered epigenetic states varies in F2 individuals, resulting in individuals with genetically identical loci displaying different epigenetic states and gene expression profiles. The change in methylation at these regions is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:1tZ8xJnm2c8C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15486722890503942393", "cites_id": ["15486722890503942393"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1613623113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-fBlr2rk69YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 6}}
