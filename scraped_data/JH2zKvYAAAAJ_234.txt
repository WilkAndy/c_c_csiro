Hybrid varieties usually exceed their parents in plant biomass and seed yield. But the molecular basis of hybrid vigour is not fully understood. In this project, we studied heterosis at early stages of seedling development in Arabidopsis hybrids derived from crossing Ler and C24 accessions. We found that early heterosis is associated with non\u2010additive gene expression that resulted from earlier changes in gene expression in the hybrids relative to the parents. The non\u2010additively expressed genes are involved in metabolic pathways, including photosynthesis, critical for plant growth. The early increased expression levels of genes involved in energy production in hybrids is associated with heterosis in the young seedlings that could be essential for biomass heterosis at later developmental stages of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12477593492663327521", "cites_id": ["12477593492663327521"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.13285", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IVvsJSxRKa0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 6}}
