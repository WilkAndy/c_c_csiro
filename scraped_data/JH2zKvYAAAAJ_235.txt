In par ticular, the present invention provides methods of altering fibre initiation in cotton making use of transcription factors, regulatory proteins or cell cycle proteins produced at or around anthesis. The invention also relates to the use of these as markers of fibre production in plants including cotton."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5733897430619431506,2436647866150401394", "cites_id": ["5733897430619431506", "2436647866150401394"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US8049069B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UqKYalXlkk8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
