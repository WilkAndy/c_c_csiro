Mutants and ecotypes with elevated expression of FLC are late flowering and vernalization responsive. In this study we describe an early flowering mutant in the C24 ecotype, flc expressor (flx), that has reduced expression of FLC. FLX encodes a protein of unknown function with putative leucine zipper domains. FLX is required for FRIGIDA (FRI)-mediated activation of FLC but not for activation of FLC in autonomous pathway mutants. FLX is also required for expression of the FLC paralogs MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING 1 (MAF1) and MAF2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11384518001699352775", "cites_id": ["11384518001699352775"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/49/2/191/1923104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x3BUBs7u_Z0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
