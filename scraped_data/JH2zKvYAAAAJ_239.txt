We have shown by complementation of the Arabidopsis ga3-2 mutant that the CYP701A1 cDNA encodes an ent-kaurene oxidase activity. Another cDNA, CYP88A2, encodes a protein which is in the same subfamily as the maize Dwarf3 protein and is likely to encode another GA biosynthetic enzyme catalysing a reaction between ent-kaurenoic acid and GA12."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15062127191845097296", "cites_id": ["15062127191845097296"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP00079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UM-t3-BsB9EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
