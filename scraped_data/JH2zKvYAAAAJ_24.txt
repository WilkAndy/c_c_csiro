A  gibberellin-responsive barley mutant, grd5, accumulates  ent-kaurenoic acid in developing grains. Three  independent grd5 mutants contain mutations in a gene  encoding a member of the CYP88A subfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes,  defined by the maize Dwarf3 protein. Mutation of the  Dwarf3 gene gives rise to a gibberellin-responsive dwarf  phenotype, but the lesion in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway has  not been identified. Arabidopsis thaliana has two  CYP88A genes, both of which are expressed. Yeast strains  expressing cDNAs encoding each of the two Arabidopsis  and the barley CYP88A enzymes catalyze the three steps of the GA  biosynthesis pathway from ent-kaurenoic acid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 390, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3545555207487428480", "cites_id": ["3545555207487428480"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.98.4.2065", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gBfTEa1XNDEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 12, "2002": 17, "2003": 10, "2004": 17, "2005": 17, "2006": 26, "2007": 9, "2008": 19, "2009": 12, "2010": 11, "2011": 17, "2012": 20, "2013": 12, "2014": 20, "2015": 23, "2016": 17, "2017": 20, "2018": 15, "2019": 19, "2020": 29, "2021": 23, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
