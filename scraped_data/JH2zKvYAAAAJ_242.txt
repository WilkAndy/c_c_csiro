Various MML genes have been shown to be important regulators of epidermal cell differentiation in different plant species, including specifying cell shape in petals, vegetative trichome initiation and branching and seed fiber initiation (Martin et al., 2002; Machado et al., 2009; Walford et al., 2011). Indeed, the conical cells of petals look very much like young fibers shortly after they protrude from the epidermal surface of the cotton seed and begin to elongate, so it is likely there is some commonality in cellular regulation between the different tissue types.
