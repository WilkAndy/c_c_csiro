A total of 164 water sites, including rice paddies, were surveyed for schistosome vector snails and monthly changes in snail population density and infection rate were determined in selected water sites. Bulinus globosus was more widely distributed than Biomphalaria pfeifferi but the latter species showed a higher infection prevalence (12.3%) than the former one (10.3%). Snail population density and infection rate fluctuated with season, being higher in the dry season and lower during periods of heavy rainfall. Dessication and/or heat stress may have contributed to the contraction of snail population size at the end of the dry season. More water sites contained infected snails during December through February than at any other time of the year. In selected water sites examined at monthly intervals, mean snail density was higher in rice paddies than in other water contact sites but the latter showed a higher prevalence of infected snails than the former. The overall prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni (24.8%) was significantly higher than that of S. haematobium (22.7%) but the difference in prevalence rates of two species in school children was not statistically significant. The intensity of S. haematobium infection (13.2 means G) was significantly higher than that of S. mansoni (6.3 means G). Mixed infections in school children did not have a significant effect on egg output \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Y0-TYkg6YM4C", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=864908765401626885", "cites_id": ["864908765401626885"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/6138973", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BbnijPDFAAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
