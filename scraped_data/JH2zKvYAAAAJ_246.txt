Eight completely different fragment sequences that showed high homology to PLCs of both animals and plants were isolated. The variation between these putative PLCs was high and suggests that, like animals, plants have multiple isoforms of PLC. Using one of the PCR clones, we isolated a corresponding full-length Arabidopsis PLC gene (ATHATPLC1G), and sequence analysis indicated that it was most like a delta-type PLC. This gene is 2.5kb and contains seven introns, all but one of which has intron/exon border sequences that conform to the Arabidopsis consensus. The structural complexity of the gene is relatively simple compared to mammalian \u03b2-type PLCs that can be 15kb long with up to 30 introns.
