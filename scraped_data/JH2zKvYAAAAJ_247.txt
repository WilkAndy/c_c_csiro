Siokra. A high level of ADH activity is present in seed of Siokra but quickly declines during germination. When exposed to anaerobic stress the level of ADH activity can be induced several fold in both roots and shoots of seedlings. Unlike maize andArabidopsis, ADH activity can be anaerobically induced in mature green leaves. Three major ADH isozymes were resolved in Siokra, and it is proposed that two genes,Adh1 andAdh2, are coding for these three isozymes. The genes are differentially expressed. ADH1 is predominant in seed and aerobically grown roots, while ADH2 is prominent in roots only after anaerobic stress. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the ADH enzyme has a native molecular weight of approximately 81 kD and a subunit molecular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=411631940227642461", "cites_id": ["411631940227642461"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00555831", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XTR5lxFptgUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
