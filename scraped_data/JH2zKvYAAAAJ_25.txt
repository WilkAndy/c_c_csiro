In Arabidopsis and rice, there is evidence indicating a central role for members of the HKT gene family of Na+ and Na+/K+ transporters in controlling Na+ accumulation [2\u20136] and, thus, in determining salinity tolerance. However, in heterologous systems, whereas the wheat TaHKT1 protein transports both Na+ and K+, AtHKT1 is more Na+-specific [7, 8] and their sequences are not particularly closely related. Recent studies suggest that members of the HKT gene family in rice and Arabidopsis are expressed in xylem parenchyma cells and protect leaves from salinity stress by removing sodium from the xylem sap [5, 6]. Given the wealth of sequences becoming available and the potential for confusion inherent in the current nomenclature, it is timely to propose an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 389, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13385026787496595526", "cites_id": ["13385026787496595526"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(06)00139-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RpDSQfIqwbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 16, "2008": 16, "2009": 13, "2010": 15, "2011": 16, "2012": 17, "2013": 22, "2014": 31, "2015": 19, "2016": 30, "2017": 22, "2018": 39, "2019": 37, "2020": 37, "2021": 30, "2022": 22, "2023": 6}}
