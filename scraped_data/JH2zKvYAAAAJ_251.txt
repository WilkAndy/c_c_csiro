It would be simple to assume that they are related by vertical descent from a haemoglobin-containing proto-organism that evolved in the early biosphere some 1500 million years ago, but this might not be so. Recently, haemoglobin has been recognised in Vitreoscilla, a bacterium, and homology between this protein and its gene and animal and plant haemoglobins and their genes is demonstrated. This could mean that bacterial, plant and animal haemoglobins are related by vertical descent from haemoglobin present in a common proto-organism, possibly a primitive archaebacterium, that developed in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3875567583324389122", "cites_id": ["3875567583324389122"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SB/SB9900081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ar8R8y7IyDUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 3, "1992": 7, "1993": 1, "1994": 4, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
