Recently, genome-wide profiles of histone modifications have been determined by a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genomic tiling arrays (ChIP on chip) or ChIP and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in species including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice and maize. Validation of ChIP analysis by PCR or qPCR using positive and negative regions of histone modification is necessary. In contrast, information about histone modifications is limited in Chinese cabbage, Brassica rapa. The aim of this study was to develop positive and negative control primer sets for H3K4me3 (trimethylation of the 4 th lysine of H3), H3K9me2, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 in B. rapa. The expression and histone modification of four FLC paralogs in B. rapa, before and after vernalization, were examined using the method developed here. After vernalization, expression of all four BrFLC genes was reduced, and accumulation of H3K27me3 was observed in three of them. As with A. thaliana, the vernalization response and stability of FLC repression correlated with the accumulation of H3K27me3. These results suggest that the epigenetic state during vernalization is important for high bolting resistance in B. rapa. The positive and negative control primer sets developed here revealed positive and negative histone modifications in B. rapa that can be used as a control for future studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=668199586763926312", "cites_id": ["668199586763926312"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ggs/91/1/91_15-00058/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KGsg4PvrRQkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
