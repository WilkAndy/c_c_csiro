This process is known as vernalization. Studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in abiotic stress responses and several cold-responsive noncoding RNAs have been suggested to be involved in vernalization. We examined the transcriptome of the Chinese cabbage inbred line (B. rapa L. var. pekinensis) RJKB-T24, and identified 1,444 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), 551 natural antisense transcripts (NATs), and 93 intronic noncoding RNAs (incRNAs); 549 of the 2,088 lncRNAs significantly altered their expression in response to four weeks of cold treatment. Most differentially expressed lncRNAs did not lead to a change of expression levels in mRNAs covering or near lncRNAs, suggesting that the transcriptional responses to four weeks of cold treatment in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:1r-w4gtu6w8C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5035710383907209374", "cites_id": ["5035710383907209374"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-019-45650-w.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ngCJ8Olv4kUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
