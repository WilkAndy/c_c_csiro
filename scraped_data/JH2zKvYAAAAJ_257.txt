The Arabidopsis genome contains four DNA demethylase genes, DEMETER (DME), REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) also known as DEMETER-LIKE 1 (DML1), DML2, and DML3. While ROS1, DML2, and DML3 were shown to function in disease response in somatic tissues, DME has been thought to function only in reproductive tissues to maintain the maternal-specific expression pattern of a subset of imprinted genes. Here we used promoter:\u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion constructs to show that DME is constitutively expressed throughout the plant, and that ROS1, DML2, and DML3 have tissue-specific expression patterns. Loss-of-function mutations in DME cause seed abortion and therefore viable DME mutants are not available for gene function analysis. We knocked down \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13318674188258333510", "cites_id": ["13318674188258333510"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15592294.2019.1631113", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RlNN3ptv1bgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
