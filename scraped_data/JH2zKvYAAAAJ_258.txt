Despite many decades of research, the origin of satRNAs remains unknown. In this study we show that a \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene fused with a Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Y satellite RNA (Y-Sat) sequence (35S-GUS:Sat) was transcriptionally repressed in N. tabacum in comparison to a 35S-GUS transgene that did not contain the Y-Sat sequence. This repression was not due to DNA methylation at the 35S promoter, but was associated with specific DNA methylation at the Y-Sat sequence. Both northern blot hybridization and small RNA deep sequencing detected 24-nt siRNAs in wild-type Nicotiana plants with sequence homology to Y-Sat, suggesting that the N. tabacum genome contains Y-Sat-like sequences that give rise to 24-nt sRNAs capable of guiding RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) to the Y-Sat sequence in the 35S-GUS:Sat transgene. Consistent with this, Southern blot hybridization detected multiple DNA bands in Nicotiana plants that had sequence homology to Y-Sat, suggesting that Y-Sat-like sequences exist in the Nicotiana genome as repetitive DNA, a DNA feature associated with 24-nt sRNAs. Our results point to a host genome origin for CMV satRNAs, and suggest novel approach of using small RNA sequences for finding the origin of other satRNAs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3861400876451223200", "cites_id": ["3861400876451223200"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004906", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oNZBeKNzljUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 9, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
