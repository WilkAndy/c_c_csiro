Heynh. can be induced by dehydration and cold, as well as by hypoxia. A 1-kb promoter fragment (CADH: -964 to +53) is sufficient to confer the stress induction and tissue-specific developmental expression characteristics of the Adh gene to a [beta]-glucuronidase reporter gene. Deletion mapping of the 5[prime] end and site-specific mutagenesis identified four regions of the promoter essential for expression under the three stress conditions. Some sequence elements are important for response to all three stress treatments, whereas others are stress specific. The most critical region essential for expression of the Arabidopsis Adh promoter under all three environmental stresses (region IV: -172 to-141) contains sequences homologous to the GT motif (-160 to -152) and the GC motif (-147 to -144) of the maize Adh1 anaerobic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 387, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=373330217800983412", "cites_id": ["373330217800983412"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/105/4/1075/6068169", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dGPy59pVLgUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 12, "1997": 20, "1998": 10, "1999": 13, "2000": 14, "2001": 27, "2002": 21, "2003": 26, "2004": 14, "2005": 16, "2006": 14, "2007": 17, "2008": 11, "2009": 16, "2010": 12, "2011": 18, "2012": 10, "2013": 20, "2014": 10, "2015": 16, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
