While the role of RdDM in maintaining genome stability is well established, how it regulates protein-coding genes remains poorly understood and few RdDM target genes have been identified. In this study, we obtained sequences of RdDM-associated lncRNAs using nuclear RNA immunoprecipitation against ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), a key component of RdDM that binds specifically with the lncRNA. Comparison of these lncRNAs with gene expression data of RdDM mutants identified novel RdDM target genes. Surprisingly, a large proportion of these target genes were repressed in RdDM mutants suggesting that they are normally activated by RdDM. These RdDM-activated genes are more enriched for gene body lncRNA than the RdDM-repressed genes. Histone modification and RNA analyses of several RdDM-activated stress response genes detected increased levels of active histone mark and short RNA transcript in the lncRNA-overlapping gene body regions in the ago4 mutant despite the repressed expression of these genes. These results suggest that RdDM, or AGO4, may play a role in maintaining or activating stress response gene expression by directing gene body chromatin modification preventing cryptic transcription."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5116452574017921045", "cites_id": ["5116452574017921045"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/214494", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FaB4CIJKAUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
