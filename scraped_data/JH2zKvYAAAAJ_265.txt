We examined the genome-wide gene expression of two newly synthesized amphidiploids between Arabidopsis thaliana and the related species Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. 1,137 (4.7%) and 1,316 (5.4%) of probesets showed differential gene expression in A. thaliana\u2013A. halleri and A. thaliana\u2013A. lyrata hybrids respectively, compared to the mid parent value and of these, 489 were in common. Genes that differed in expression between the parental lines tended to have an expression level in both hybrids differing from the mid parent value. In contrast to protein coding genes, there is little differential expression of transposons.
