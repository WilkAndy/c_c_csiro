In plants these anaerobic inductions are believed to be associated with the plant\u2019s need for increasing sugar carbon flow through the glycolytic pathway to generate energy in the absence of oxygen (Good and Muench, 1993).During anaerobiosis, the glycolytic intermediate pyruvate is first converted into lactate (Davies et al., 1974). This results in the lowering of the cytoplasmic pH, which in tum activates PDC and inhibits lactate dehydrogenase (Roberts et al., 1984). As a result, pyruvate is nonoxidatively decarboxylated to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide by PDC. Acetaldehyde, which is toxic, is further reduced to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1. 1.1). This step regenerates NAD+, which is essential for sustained operation of anaerobic glycolysis to produce ATP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17546724128734843325", "cites_id": ["17546724128734843325"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC159721/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vREE6aB8gvMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
