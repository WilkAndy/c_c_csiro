Particular families are subpopulations of other families; their distribution supports a model of successive amplification events during the generation of the satellite. In each amplification episode one 2,500 bp unit is multiplied into a tandemly repeated array of that unit (segmental amplification). The 1.708 g/cc sequences can be detected in related kangaroo species in much reduced amount, and with changes to the long order periodicity of the repeat units."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12022767142953684406", "cites_id": ["12022767142953684406"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01175184", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tg3-ZARz2aYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 5, "1982": 5, "1983": 1, "1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
