Detailed analysis of epigenome information is anticipated to reveal how the DNA sequence of the genome is translated into the plant\u2019s phenotype. The aim of this study was to map the DNA methylation state at the whole genome level and to clarify the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription, small RNA expression, and histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9me2) in Brassica rapa. We performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing, small RNA sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing using H3K9me2 antibody in a Chinese cabbage inbred line, RJKB-T24, and examined the impact of epigenetic states on transcription. Cytosine methylation in DNA was analysed in different sequence contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16469101276273876652", "cites_id": ["16469101276273876652"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article-abstract/25/5/511/5047107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rJ48jloAjuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
