Little is known about the control of fibre initiation and development. As a first step towards discovering important genes involved in fibre initiation and development using a genomics approach, we report technical advances aimed at reducing redundancy and increasing coverage for anonymous cDNA microarrays in this study. Cotton ovule cDNA libraries (both normalised and un-normalised) from around the time of fibre initial formation have been prepared and partially characterised by sequencing. Re-association-based normalisation partially reduced library redundancy and increased representation of novel sequences. However, another library generated from in vitro cultured cotton ovules treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15708434509705318503", "cites_id": ["15708434509705318503"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00438-005-0049-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZxB5sPWR_9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
