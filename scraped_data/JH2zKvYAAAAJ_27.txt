We report analysis of mtDNA from the remains of 10 ancient  Australians. These include the morphologically gracile  Lake Mungo 3 [\u224860 thousand years (ka) before present] and three  other gracile individuals from Holocene deposits at  Willandra Lakes (<10 ka), all within the skeletal range of living  Australians, and six Pleistocene/early Holocene individuals (15 to  <8 ka) from Kow Swamp with robust morphologies outside  the skeletal range of contemporary indigenous Australians. Lake Mungo 3  is the oldest (Pleistocene) \u201canatomically modern\u201d human from whom  DNA has been recovered. His mtDNA belonged to a lineage that only  survives as a segment inserted into chromosome 11 of the nuclear  genome, which is now widespread among human \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 385, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10472998691385974835", "cites_id": ["10472998691385974835"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.98.2.537", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MyAxTdKQV5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 26, "2002": 33, "2003": 27, "2004": 27, "2005": 26, "2006": 40, "2007": 23, "2008": 21, "2009": 7, "2010": 18, "2011": 10, "2012": 13, "2013": 18, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 10, "2017": 7, "2018": 10, "2019": 11, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
