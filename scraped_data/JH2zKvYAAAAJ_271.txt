The molecular basis of hybrid vigour is not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested that epigenetic systems could play a role in heterosis.In this project, we investigated genome-wide patterns of four histone modifications in Arabidopsis hybrids in germinating seeds. We found that although hybrids have similar histone modification patterns to the parents in most regions of the genome, they have altered patterns at specific loci. A small subset of genes show changes in histone modifications in the hybrids that correlate with changes in gene expression. Our results also show that genome-wide patterns of histone modifications \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5960990622424433422", "cites_id": ["5960990622424433422"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-017-3542-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DgMLb2OxuVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
