In a Dissociation (Ds) insertion rice population, we identified a mutant, compact shoot and leafy head 1 (csl1), which produced massive number of leaves (\u223c70) during the vegetative phase. In csl1, the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase was delayed by about 2 months under long-day conditions. With a reduced leaf size and severe dwarfism, csl1 failed to produce a normal panicle after the transition to reproductive growth. Instead, it produced a leafy panicle, in which all primary rachis-branches were converted to vegetative shoots. Phenotypically csl1 resembled pla mutants in short plastochron but was more severe in the conversion of the reproductive organs to vegetative organs. In addition, neither the expression nor the coding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8489956199461230499", "cites_id": ["8489956199461230499"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00299-006-0259-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oxeDgy5i0nUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
