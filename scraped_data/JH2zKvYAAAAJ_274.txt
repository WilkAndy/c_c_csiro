Fusarium yellows caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans (Foc) is an important disease of Brassicaceae; however, the mechanism of how host plants respond to Foc is still unknown. By comparing with and without Foc inoculation in both resistant and susceptible lines of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. pekinensis), we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the bulked inoculated (6, 12, 24, and 72 h after inoculation (HAI)) and non-inoculated samples. Most of the DEGs were up-regulated by Foc inoculation. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that most up-regulated genes increased their expression levels from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7227807245539798562", "cites_id": ["7227807245539798562"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00299-017-2198-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Iu5kL2VUTmQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
