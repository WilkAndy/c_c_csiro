CYP83A1 appears to be encoded by a single copy gene. The gene contains one intron in a position identical to that found in other class A P450 genes. Putative cis\u2010acting elements implicated in the regulation of phenylpropanoid/flavonoid biosynthetic genes (SBF\u20101, MYB Ph3, and P\u2010MYB) were identified in the promoter region. The coding region was functional in yeast in binding carbon monoxide and tetcyclacis, suggesting that CYP83A1 was produced in its native state enabling it to interact properly with these two cyt P450 inhibitors. However, no activity could be detected when assayed in P450\u2010dependent reactions of gibberellin or phenylpropanoid biosynthesis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17045651648829819144", "cites_id": ["17045651648829819144"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00444.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CImN5dxRjuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
