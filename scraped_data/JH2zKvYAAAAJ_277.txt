Siokra), a plant that is intolerant to anoxia. Using [35S]methionine labelling and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis it was demonstrated that 14 major polypeptides are being selectively synthesised during oxygen deprivation. These polypeptides have been designated the cotton anaerobic polypeptides (ANPs), and have estimated molecular masses that correspond to molecular masses of ANPs from other plant species. However, compared to maize, several of the major molecular weight classes are absent, suggesting that the response to oxygen deprivation in cotton is simpler than that of maize. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity is induced by oxygen deprivation. Using western analysis we have determined that this increase in activity is correlated with the accumulation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1384363977272422204", "cites_id": ["1384363977272422204"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9960341", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PG8r4bM_NhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
