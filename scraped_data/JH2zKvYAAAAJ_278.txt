These screen is based on the visual difference in length between a seed pod that is seedless (short silique) and one in which seed is formed normally by self-pollination and fertilization (long silique). The rationale of the screen is to mutagenize a stamenless (and therefore pollenless) mutant of Arabidopsis with short siliques into plants that form seed without pollination and therefore have long siliques. Using the shortness of siliques of the Arabidopsis mutant pistillata (pi) compared with wild type as the basis of our genetic screen for apomixis, a number of mutants have been isolated which have fertilization independent partial seed development (fis1, fis2 and fis3) and some mutants which may have a low frequency of fertilization independent complete seed development (fis4). Homozygous pistillata (pi/pi) or heterozygous pi/PI seeds were mutagenized with ethylmethanesulphonate and screened for dominant and recessive mutants, respectively. In 40,000 M 2 pi/pi plants, eight mutants have been identified in which partial development of seeds occurs without fertilization (Fis phenotype). Three mutants, fis1, fis2 and fis3, have been characterized. In each of the three mutants, endosperm develops normally to the point of cellularization. At a lower frequency, embroys are also seen that degenerate without development beyond the globular stage. Following pollination, the maternal embryos formed are arrested at the torpedo stage and the endosperm develops to the cellular breakdown \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11836450476568997209", "cites_id": ["11836450476568997209"], "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:27028538", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:We1lCf-EQ6QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 5, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
