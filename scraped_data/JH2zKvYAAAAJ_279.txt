Canola hybrids show heterosis in a variety of traits compared to parents, including increased biomass at the early stages of seedling establishment, which is a critical developmental step that impacts future plant growth and seed yield. In this study, we examined transcriptomes of two parental lines, Garnet (Gar) and NX0052 (0052), and their reciprocal hybrids, Gar/0052, at 4 and 8\u2009days after sowing (DAS). In hybrids, early seedling biomass heterosis is correlated with earlier expression of genes in photosynthesis pathways relative to parents. The hybrids also showed early expression of genes in the auxin biosynthesis pathway, consistent with the higher auxin concentrations detected in hybrid seedlings at 4 DAS. Auxin is a key phytohormone that regulates plant development promoting cell \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=724200574105389182", "cites_id": ["724200574105389182"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/61/6/1134/5811764", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:foivzZXgDAoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
