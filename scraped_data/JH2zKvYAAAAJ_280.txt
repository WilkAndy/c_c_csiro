In hybrids between C24 and Landsberg erecta (Ler), biomass vigor (heterosis) occurs in the first few days after sowing (DAS), with hybrid cotyledons being larger than those of their parents. C24xLer hybrids are ahead of their parents in activating photosynthesis and auxin pathway genes in cotyledons at 3\u20134 DAS. \u201cEarliness\u201d is also present in newly emerged C24xLer hybrid leaves. We showed cotyledon removal at 4 DAS caused significant biomass reduction in later growth in hybrids and parental lines. The biomass decrease caused by cotyledon removal can be partially rescued by exogenous sucrose or auxin with different genotypes responding to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:c59VksA5Vz4C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1541908738594237227", "cites_id": ["1541908738594237227"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00425-018-3068-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K-v6D9T1ZRUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
