We carried out a 2D gel analysis and showed that the majority of endogenous FLC and overexpressed FLC-FLAG proteins are post-translationally modified. The endogenous and transgenic proteins have different floral repressor activities; however, they have similar, if not the same, profiles of post-translational modifications. The protein modification profile was also not changed by vernalization treatment. The activities of other MADS box proteins have been shown to be affected by phosphorylation and we found that both the endogenous FLC and the transgenic FLC-FLAG protein are phosphorylated. When eight potential serine kinase target sites in FLC were changed to mimic phosphorylated residues, expression of the mutant FLC-FLAG protein led to early flowering, suggesting that the repressive function was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=406505130115338099", "cites_id": ["406505130115338099"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/49/12/1859/1825539", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cw_mF0MypAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
