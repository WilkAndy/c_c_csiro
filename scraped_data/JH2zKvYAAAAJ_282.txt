They participate in the biosynthesis of GAs, membrane sterols, fatty acids, terpenoids, lignin phenolics, flavonoids, and phytoalexins (Donaldson and Luster, 1991). We are interested in the regulation of GA biosynthesis and its possible role in cold-induced stem elongation and flowering in the crucifer, Thlaspi arvense L.(Hazebroek et al., 1993). Cyts P-450 appear to catalyze four consecutive steps early in the GA biosynthetic pathway: ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenol to ent-kaurenal to entkaurenoic acid to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid (Graebe, 1987). We are attempting to clone the genes encoding these Cyts I \u2018-450, using the strategy described below. Cyts P-450 share a number of conserved domains in their amino acid sequences (Bozak et al., 1990). We have taken advantage of this and used a PCR strategy to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2520843396501598709", "cites_id": ["2520843396501598709"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC159420/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9fHdjrbV-yIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
