The best known of these, rennin (EC 3.4. 4-3), exerts its effect by specifically destroying the micelle stabilizing component K-casein 1. During such attack K-casein is converted to insoluble pars-K-casein by the release of a soluble portion comprising approximately 25% of the total nitrogen and containing most of the carbohydrate 2& In intact K-casein this soluble portion, or glycomacropeptide, is joined by means of an ester bond to the carboxyl group of a phenylalanine residue in the rest of the molecule 4& The specific action of rennin is to hydrolyze this bond.Pepsin (EC 3.4. 4.1) and chymotrypsin (EC 3.4. 4.5) also have powerful milkclotting activities 6. Pepsin has been shown to release the same glycomacropeptide from whole casein as rennin 7. In the present study it is shown that both enzymes rapidly convert K-casein into an insoluble product. Their modes of action are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16173495496584051921", "cites_id": ["16173495496584051921"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304416565902850", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0bxFmnbMc-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1976": 1, "1977": 1, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
