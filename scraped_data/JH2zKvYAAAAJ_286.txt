To facilitate the selection of transgenic lines with simple T-DNA insertions, we constructed a binary vector (pSIV) based on the principle of hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-induced gene silencing. The vector is designed so that any transformed cells that contain more than one insertion per locus should generate hpRNA against the selective marker gene, leading to its silencing. These cells should, therefore, be sensitive to the selective agent and less likely to regenerate. Results from Arabidopsis and tobacco transformation showed that pSIV gave considerably fewer transgenic lines with repetitive insertions than did a conventional T-DNA vector (pCON). Furthermore, the transgene was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14465797773678909988", "cites_id": ["14465797773678909988"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/FP05072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JJrEnG7WwMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
