We investigated the distribution of the histone mark tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) in B. rapa and its role in the control of gene expression at two stages of development (2-day cotyledons and 14-day leaves) and among paralogs in the triplicated genome. H3K27me3 has a similar distribution in two inbred lines, while there was variation of H3K27me3 sites between tissues. Sites that are specific to 2-day cotyledons have increased transcriptional activity, and low levels of H3K27me3 in the gene body region. In 14-day leaves, levels of H3K27me3 were associated with decreased gene expression. In the triplicated genome, H3K27me3 is associated with paralogs that have tissue-specific expression. Even though B. rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana are not closely related within the Brassicaceae, there is conservation of H3K27me3-marked sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:WwIwg2wKZ0QC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8474762357174669436", "cites_id": ["8474762357174669436"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article-abstract/26/5/433/5588861", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fJA_b3ZnnHUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
