Self-incompatibility is successfully used for the production of F1 hybrid seeds in B. rapa vegetables to avoid contamination by non-hybrid seeds, and the strength of self-incompatibility is important for harvesting a highly pure F1 seeds. Prediction of agronomically important traits such as disease resistance based on DNA markers is useful. In this dataset, we identified the S haplotypes by DNA markers and evaluated the strength of self-incompatibility in Chinese cabbage inbred lines. The data described the predicted disease resistance to Fusarium yellows or clubroot in 22 Chinese cabbage inbred lines using gene associated or gene linked DNA markers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7608750078117348455", "cites_id": ["7608750078117348455"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340915003534", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZwTpFuK1l2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
