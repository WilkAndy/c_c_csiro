Thetms2 gene encodes indoleacetic acid hydrolase (IAAH) which converts naphthaleneacetamide (NAM) to the potent auxin naphthaleneacetic acid, a phytotoxic derivative. This gene, under the control of the manopine synthase gene 2 promoter fromAgrobacterium tumefaciens and exogenously applied NAM, have been used effectively as a negative selector inAc/Ds insertional mutagenesis ofArabidopsis thaliana (Sundaresan et al., 1995). In this study we show thattms2 can also be used as a negative selector in rice. T1 transgenic seedlings expressing thistms2 gene under the control of themas2\u2019 promoter showed significant reduction in shoot and root growth in the presence of 5\u201310 \u03bcM NAM under specified growth conditions compared to plants not containing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8412845280665574738", "cites_id": ["8412845280665574738"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02823993", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Up1kqDVuwHQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
