Recent advances in molecular biology have facilitated the analysis of some of the molecular events triggered by anaerobic stress and the mechanisms regulating this physiologically important stress response. Within 2 min of the transfer of maize roots to an anaerobic environment oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited, as indicated by an increase in cytoplasmic NADH levels (Roberts et al., 1984). In anaerobic cells of higher plants the NAD+ required for continued glycolysis may be regenerated via the lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) reactions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9096492965084375930", "cites_id": ["9096492965084375930"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-3304-7_67", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:equxDSg8PX4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
