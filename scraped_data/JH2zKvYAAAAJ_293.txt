At a similar time, the article \u201cGenes Directing Flower Development in Arabidopsis\u201d by Bowman, Smyth, and Meyerowitz (Bowman et al., 1989) was published in the first issue of The Plant Cell. This article was important as it presented a new approach to understanding gene-based plant development and expanded our thinking with regard to genes and plant processes. It changed our lab focus from analyzing promoters and environmental responses to investigating genes controlling development. The article also showed the power of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as a research system and was instrumental in our switching from maize (Zea mays). The Bowman et al. study of plant development provided a clear demonstration of how analysis of gene \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13763358013997010698", "cites_id": ["13763358013997010698"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/31/6/1192/5985666", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ck_RPDFFAb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
