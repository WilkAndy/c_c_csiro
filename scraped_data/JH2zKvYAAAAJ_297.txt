In order to facilitate cloning of a male sterility gene, 23 of Feldmann's T-DNA-generated, reduced-fertility lines were screened to identify a tagged male-sterile mutation. Malesterile mutants were identified, as well as mutants that were both male and female sterile. Segregation of the kanamycin marker gene in the progeny of 15 of these lines was studied. Forty percent had functional T-DNAs (encoding resistance to kanamycin) inserted at a single locus, the remainder segregating for two or more functional T-DNA inserts. Linkage between T-DNA inserts and mutant phenotype was tested for six lines. In three of these lines, mutations were not linked to a T-DNA insert. In three lines, the mutation segregated with a T-DNA insert."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8027646293565411983", "cites_id": ["8027646293565411983"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02673365", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j5JyjsXtZ28J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
