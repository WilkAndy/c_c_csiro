The FLF gene appears to integrate the vernalization-dependent and autonomous flowering pathways because its expression is regulated by genes in both pathways. The level of FLF mRNA is downregulated by vernalization and by a decrease in genomic DNA methylation, which is consistent with our previous suggestion that vernalization acts to induce flowering through changes in gene activity that are mediated through a reduction in DNA methylation. The flf-1 mutant requires a greater than normal amount of an exogenous gibberellin (GA3) to decrease flowering time compared with the wild type or with vernalization-responsive late-flowering mutants, suggesting that the FLF gene product may block the promotion of flowering by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 1104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4827853804347635372", "cites_id": ["4827853804347635372"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/11/3/445/6008534", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rLaou3T7_0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 11, "2000": 34, "2001": 36, "2002": 46, "2003": 79, "2004": 59, "2005": 52, "2006": 55, "2007": 66, "2008": 59, "2009": 55, "2010": 43, "2011": 53, "2012": 63, "2013": 50, "2014": 48, "2015": 40, "2016": 36, "2017": 29, "2018": 48, "2019": 23, "2020": 40, "2021": 34, "2022": 29, "2023": 12}}
