Overexpression of ATAF2 leads to an increased biomass and yellowing of the leaves, but there is no obvious phenotype in two independent ATAF2 T\u2010DNA insertion lines. At the transcriptome level, ATAF2 overexpression resulted in repression of a number of pathogenesis\u2010related proteins. Conversely, four of these pathogenesis\u2010related transcripts were increased in both ATAF2 knock\u2010out lines. ATAF2 overexpressing plants showed a higher susceptibility to the soil\u2010borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. Our results indicate that ATAF2 functions as a repressor of pathogenesis\u2010related proteins in Arabidopsis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 357, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2639321924270997148", "cites_id": ["2639321924270997148"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02488.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nL4ScE7BoCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 7, "2007": 17, "2008": 14, "2009": 21, "2010": 15, "2011": 15, "2012": 26, "2013": 24, "2014": 31, "2015": 29, "2016": 25, "2017": 21, "2018": 27, "2019": 26, "2020": 21, "2021": 13, "2022": 22, "2023": 2}}
