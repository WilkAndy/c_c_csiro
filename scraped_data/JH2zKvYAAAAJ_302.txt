The subjects studied came from two adjacent coastal villages near Port Moresby where the prevalence of leprosy was high. Five hundred and fifteen people, from a total population of 545, were clinically examined and 17 cases of leprosy found. On clinical grounds, ten of these were lepromatous and seven tuberculoid. Detailed genealogies of all families were taken and used as the basis for selection of subjects. Twenty children without leprosy, aged from 5 to 18 years, were chosen from families in which cases of leprosy had been identified. These children all had at least one sibling or one parent with leprosy, some had both, and some also had a grandparent with leprosy. The index leprosy cases in these families were all classified clinically as lepromatous. On subsequent histopathologic examination,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9625425370485651513", "cites_id": ["9625425370485651513"], "pub_url": "http://ila.ilsl.br/pdfs/v43n4a02.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OXjUc2BhlIUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 1, "1978": 3, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 3, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
