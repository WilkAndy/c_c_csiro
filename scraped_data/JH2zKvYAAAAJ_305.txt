The authors point out that, by contrast, it can take over 100 cell doublings for the telomeres of a temperature-sensitive rapl yeast strain grown at the permissive temperature to achieve a new, shorter length once the cells have been shifted to the restrictive temperature.Although Burr and coworkers' results indicate that maize telomere tracts can readjust to new lengths relatively rapidly, it has yet to be confirmed that plant cells do in fact have telomerase. It remains possible that some other mechanism, such as recombination, is responsible for plant telomere extension. It may also turn out that the correlation between telomere shortening and senescence seen in humans and in certain yeast and Tetrahymena mutants will not hold in plants. The fact that maize strains whose telo-mere lengths differ by 20-fold are equally vigorous implies that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13598943089957490988", "cites_id": ["13598943089957490988"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1459082/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LFGrpbAmubwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
