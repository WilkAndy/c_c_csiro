As well as being under genetic control, gene expression is regulated by epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. We compared genome-wide gene expression between Arabidopsis thaliana and the related species Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera to understand which genes might contribute to species differences. Genes categorized into response to stress tended to show differential expression between species, suggesting that divergence of expression in these genes contributes to adaptation to environmental conditions following the divergence of species. Regions methylated in A. lyrata were identified from Methylated-DNA immunoprecipitation, and this DNA methylation profile together with transcriptome data revealed that gene body \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17615271350126558695", "cites_id": ["17615271350126558695"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111912008062", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:571olvYDdvQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1}}
