The CryIIIA protein was highly effective against C. bimaculata when presented on adult Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden leaves, but not when leaves of the preferred host E. regnans F. Muell. were used. The difference between tree species may be the result of differences in the amount of endotoxin ingested or to interactions between the cryIIIA protein and eucalypt allelochemicals, (e.g., leaf oils). CryIIIA was not effective against C. agricola fed on juvenile E. nitens leaves coated with cryIIIA protein. We also tested purified protein encoded by the cryIA(b) gene of B. thuringiensis variety kurstaki in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12109534928416555013", "cites_id": ["12109534928416555013"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/89/6/1392/2216582", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BUB0u9u1DagJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2}}
