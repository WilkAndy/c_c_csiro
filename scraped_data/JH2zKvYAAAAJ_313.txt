A significant proportion (~ 30%) of this cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis is dependent on the RNA-silencing pathway known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM; Matzke et al, 2009). RdDM has a crucial role in silencing retrotransposons and endogenous repeats, thereby maintaining genome stability. It probably also has a role in regulating the transcriptional activities of plant genes that contain, or are adjacent to, transposons or repetitive elements, many of which might have a role in stress responses. In addition, RdDM is required for the maintenance and systemic transmission of post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants (Brosnan et al, 2007; Eamens et al, 2008), presumably by causing modification of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4937519835546159966", "cites_id": ["4937519835546159966"], "pub_url": "https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/embor.2009.101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XossXSGYhUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
