Virtually the entire 4.5-kb Ac element is transcribed as a single RNA molecule from which four introns are spliced to yield a 3.5-kb mRNA. The Ac mRNA codes for an 807 amino acid protein, which is presumably the transposase. The Ac element can be reversibly inactivated by methylation of the promoter and 5\u2032 untranscribed leader region to convert the Ac element to a Ds-like element.The Ac element can support the transposition both of itself and of a number of types of Ds elements. The Ds elements have the same terminal inverted repeats as does Ac, and also are associated with the characteristic 8-bp duplication of host DNA at the site of insertion. The Ds1 element, which was first isolated from the Adh1-Fm335 allele, is a 405-bp segment and is repeated 40\u201350 times in the genomes of all maize lines, and in the maize relatives \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14155029470362004517", "cites_id": ["14155029470362004517"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-5550-2_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jewchk7EcMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
