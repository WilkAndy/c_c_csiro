The promotion of flowering is proportional to the duration of the cold period, but the mechanism by which plants measure time at low temperatures has been a long\u2010standing mystery. We show that the quantitative induction of the first gene in the Arabidopsis vernalization pathway, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE\u20033 (VIN3), is regulated by the components of Polycomb Response Complex\u20032, which trimethylates histone H3 lysine\u200327 (H3K27me3). In differentiated animal cells, H3K27me3 is mostly associated with long\u2010term gene repression, whereas, in pluripotent embyonic stem cells, many cell lineage\u2010specific genes are inactive but exist in bivalent chromatin that carries both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks on the same molecule.
