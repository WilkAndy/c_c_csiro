Rice yields in most temperate climate zones are variable and yield losses due to coldinduced pollen sterility (CIPS) are the main contributor to this variation. The problem of CIPS is therefore a major bottleneck for the further improvement of rice yields in those areas. The growing season in temperate climate zones is shorter, confronting rice crops with colder conditions both at the start and end of the season. Cold spells at the reproductive stage are most damaging and an estimated 7 million ha world-wide are prone to this damage (Sthapit and Witcombe, 1998). In Australia, cool temperatures during the early booting stage cause an average yield reduction of 5\u201310% annually ($A44 million), with cold snaps occurring on average every 3\u20134 years causing severe yield losses of 20\u201340% (Jacobs and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10522419553317002403", "cites_id": ["10522419553317002403"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6635-1_31", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o5wVZdUkB5IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
