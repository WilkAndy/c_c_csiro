In their separate papers in this volume, Trueman, Colgan, and Groves raise concerns about our results. These con-cerns can be summarized by three questions:(/) are the sequence data correct?(ii) are the phylogenetic methods appropriate? and (Hi) are the conclusions valid? We recently addressed some of the issues raised by Trueman, Colgan, and Groves in a response (Adcock et al 2001b) to a letter by Cooper et al (2001). This response reaffirmed the robustness of the methods used for obtaining ancient DNA and argued that these methods were of the standard expected for such work. Cooper et al (2001) inferred an alternative phylogeny, similar to the one constructed by Trueman, which grouped LM3 and the Insert sequence together within the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14623565080550418039", "cites_id": ["14623565080550418039"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/40387209", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d6YDOPZW8coJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
