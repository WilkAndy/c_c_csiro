Previous studies showed that genes related to salicylic acid (SA) response were more highly induced following Foc infection in Brassica rapa Fusarium yellows resistant lines than susceptible lines. However, SA-induced genes have not been identified at the whole genome level and it was unclear whether they were up-regulated by Foc inoculation.
