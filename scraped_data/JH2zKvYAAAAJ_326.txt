No, the vernalization response has clearly evolved independently in monocots like wheat and barley and in dicots like Arabidopsis, canola and other Brassicas. While the physiological properties of the vernalization response are similar between the two plant kingdoms, the molecular details differ. As we\u2019ve seen, in Arabidopsis, FLC, a repressor of flowering, is the target of epigenetic regulation. In cereals, the expression of a related gene, VERNALIZATION 1, a promoter of flowering, is also under epigenetic control. In both cases, the epigenetic control is provided by the activity of Polycomb group proteins."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:QVtou7C4vgoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=602078467213785727", "cites_id": ["602078467213785727"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(12)00528-3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f3owDS0DWwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
