Progress toward a reference sequence for the smallest Gossypium genome is a logical stepping-stone toward revealing diversity in the remaining seven genomes (A, B, C, E, F, G, K) that permitted Gossypium species to adapt to a wide range of ecosystems in warmer arid regions of the world, and toward identifying the emergent properties that account for the superior productivity and quality of tetraploid cottons. The greatest challenge facing the cotton community is not genome sequencing per se but the conversion of sequence to knowledge."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15751455139718885697", "cites_id": ["15751455139718885697"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12042-010-9051-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QfFxqv5omNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
