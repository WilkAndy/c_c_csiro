The pAdh1-gpt plasmids transformed the recipient cells for resistance to mycophenolic acid plus xanthine (3) and the analogous pAdh1-neo plasmid transformed cells to G418 resistance (2). S             1              analysis of transient transfections of CV1 cells with various derivatives of pAdh1-gpt confirmed that production of gpt mRNA is initiated at the              Adh1              promoter at and near the same site used in transcription of the intact              Adh1              gene in maize. Moreover, expression of the              Adh1              promoter was increased 10\u201320 fold if the SV40 early region enhancer sequence was included in the same molecule.
