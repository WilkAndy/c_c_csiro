FLC binds and represses two genes that promote flowering, FT and SOC1. We show that FLC binds to many other genes, indicating that it has regulatory roles other than the repression of flowering. We identified 505 FLC binding sites, mostly located in the promoter regions of genes and containing at least one CArG box, the motif known to be associated with MADS-box proteins such as FLC. We examined 40 of the target genes, and 20 showed increased transcript levels in an flc mutant compared with the wild type. Five genes showed decreased expression in the mutant, indicating that FLC binding can result in either transcriptional repression or activation. The genes we identified as FLC targets are involved in developmental pathways throughout the life history of the plant, many of which are associated with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 342, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12506493990261402090", "cites_id": ["12506493990261402090"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1103175108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6qkWmwX-j60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 10, "2012": 23, "2013": 19, "2014": 42, "2015": 27, "2016": 23, "2017": 22, "2018": 35, "2019": 36, "2020": 26, "2021": 38, "2022": 28, "2023": 12}}
