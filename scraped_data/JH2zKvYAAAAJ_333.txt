The signals for evocation can be developmental, such as the age of a plant, or environmental, such as daylength or a period of cold treatment. Genes controlling this process have not yet been isolated. On the other hand, genes that control floral development have been characterized and extensively studied in both snapdragon (Antirrhinum m&s) and cress (Arabidopti thaliuna)[l-7]. m both species, molecular studies have depended on the use of mutants [S], particularly homeotic mutants, in which a particular floral organ develops in the wrong place. Some of these mutants were first \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6140723640127385718", "cites_id": ["6140723640127385718"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096098229390162H", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dvCioZ07OFUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
