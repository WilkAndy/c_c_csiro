Here we use two types of spatial statistics to describe and quantify differences in patterning of cotton ovule fibre initials (FI). The following five different species of Gossypium were analysed: G. hirsutum L., G. barbadense L., G. arboreum, G. raimondii Ulbrich. and G. trilobum (DC.) Skovsted. Scanning electron micrographs of FIs were taken on the day of anthesis. Cell centres for fibre and epidermal cells were digitised and analysed by spatial statistics methods appropriate for marked point processes and tessellations. Results were consistent with previously published reports of fibre number and spacing. However, it was shown that the spatial distributions of FIs in all of species examined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6979240525037231879", "cites_id": ["6979240525037231879"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/BT07003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:B9_aqEc-22AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
