It is important that researchers and plant breeders especially from Asian countries access the techniques and resources of plant functional genomics, not only to remain competitive globally in rice research and development activities, but also to increase yields by alleviating some of the rice production constraints. These newly identified genes and gene control sequences can be used in transformation breeding and as molecular markers in classical plant breeding.At CSIRO Plant Industry we are using an insertional mutagenesis approach in rice to relate genes to their functions. With national and international collaboration we hope to create a substantial \"Rice Gene Machine\" comprised of many thousands of rice insertion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12611982827639755953", "cites_id": ["12611982827639755953"], "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219030302001945", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sVTLgo_DBq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
