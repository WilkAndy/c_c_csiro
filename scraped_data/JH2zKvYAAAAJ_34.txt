A novel source of Na+ exclusion conferring salt tolerance to durum wheat is present in the durum wheat Line 149 derived from Triticum monococcum C68-101, and a quantitative trait locus contributing to low Na+ concentration in leaf blades, Nax1, mapped to chromosome 2AL. In this study, we used the rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequence and data from the wheat expressed sequence tag deletion bin mapping project to identify markers and construct a high-resolution map of the Nax1 region. Genes on wheat chromosome 2AL and rice chromosome 4L had good overall colinearity, but there was an inversion of a chromosomal segment that includes the Nax1 locus. Two putative sodium transporter genes (TmHKT7) related to OsHKT7 were mapped to chromosome 2AL.
