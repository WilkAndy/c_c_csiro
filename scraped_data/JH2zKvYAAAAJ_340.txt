It also describes the yeast assay used to demonstrate that CYP701A subfamily members are ent-kaurene oxidases and that CYP88A subfamily members are ent-kaurenoic acid oxidases. Gibberellin biosynthesis starts from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Two terpene cyclases, copalyl diphosphate synthase and kaurene synthase, catalyze cyclization reactions to produce ent-kaurene. Cytochrome P450s then catalyze the oxidation of ent-kaurene to GA12. The steps of the pathway from GA12 to the bioactive GAs are catalyzed by soluble dioxygenases. One method to isolate genes encoding P450s in the GA biosynthesis pathway is to take advantage of a mutation in a gene encoding one of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6169439482337524967", "cites_id": ["6169439482337524967"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687902576965/pdf?md5=1ed5aeaa0e7272a39daa2833087305ca&pid=1-s2.0-S0076687902576965-main.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:53z_p4VAnlUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
