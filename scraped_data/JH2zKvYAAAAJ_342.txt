From there interest turned to gene regulation in higher eukaryotes and, amongst plant gene systems, the genetics and biochemistry of the maize alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1) received immediate attention from two groups (Scandalios, 1966; Schwartz, 1966; Schwartz and Endo, 1966)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14322845330394424305", "cites_id": ["14322845330394424305"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-6989-6_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8aMFO_H3xMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
