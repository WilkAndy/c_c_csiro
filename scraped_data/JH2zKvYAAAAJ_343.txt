In hybrids between Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler), and Wassilewskija (Ws) and Ler, there was significant seed yield heterosis. F6/F7 Hybrid Mimics derived from hybrids of each of the two systems had seed yield increases similar to that of the F1 hybrid (approximately 50\u201370% greater than the average of the parents). Increased seed yield of the Hybrid Mimics was accompanied by changes of plant architecture with increased plant height and increased inflorescence branch number relative to the parents.
