This approach led to the isolation of mutants that mapped to the ADH gene itself. We attempted to use allyl alcohol selection for the isolation of adh1 regulatory mutants in Arabidopsis. First we selected at plantlet level on ADH1\u2013GUS transgenic plants. This enabled us to use GUS staining to discriminate between structural and regulatory mutants. Allyl alcohol selection of 50000 EMS-treated seeds did not yield any potential mutants. Secondly we selected EMS and \u03b3-ray-treated seeds of a transgenic line transformed with an additional copy of the ADH1 gene including its own promoter. Fifteen allyl alcohol-resistant plants were selected from the mutagenized seed.
