The gene is located on a region of chromosome 5 containing the RFLP markers g4111, g4560 and g21503. Using yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) libraries, we have constructed a contig of 38 YACs spanning approximately 2.1 megabases (approximately 2% of the genome) around MS1 and redefined the order of these RFLP markers. Chimeric YACs and repetitive DNA caused problems in chromosome 'walking'. A method for cloning YAC right ends by plasmid rescue was applied to arabidopsis. One YAC end contained a portion of the A. thaliana sucrose synthase gene ASUSI, hence locating this gene on chromosome 5 near MS1. Using recombinant plant populations containing ms1 and flanking markers, MS1 was localised to a 200 kb region within the YAC contig.
