A fragment of the predicted size was amplified from genomlc DNA from Arabidopsis thaliana. Overlapping cDNA clones, some with homology to the PCR amplified fragment, were Identified and sequenced. The assembled nucleic acid sequence Is 4720 bp and encodes a protein of 1534 amlno acids which has significant homology to prokaryote and mammalian cytosine methyltransferases. Like mammalian methylases, this enzyme has a C terminal methyltransferase domain linked to a second larger domain. The Arabidopsis methylase has eight of the ten conserved sequence motifs found in prokaryote cytoslne-5 methyltransferases and shows 50% homology to the murlne enzyme \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 339, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16922089950267573400", "cites_id": ["16922089950267573400"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/21/10/2383/1258633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mAToFidX1-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 6, "1995": 16, "1996": 8, "1997": 5, "1998": 15, "1999": 8, "2000": 10, "2001": 6, "2002": 12, "2003": 13, "2004": 11, "2005": 14, "2006": 12, "2007": 12, "2008": 17, "2009": 11, "2010": 8, "2011": 14, "2012": 19, "2013": 12, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 9, "2018": 19, "2019": 13, "2020": 7, "2021": 15, "2022": 19, "2023": 3}}
