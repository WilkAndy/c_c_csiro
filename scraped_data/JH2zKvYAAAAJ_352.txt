McClintock demonstrated genetically thatAc and Ds were short regions of DNA which could move (transpose) from one chromosomal location to another. McClintock also established that Ds could transpose only in response to the action of Ac (i.e. both elements were required in the same nucleus for Ds transposition), and that Ac could transpose autonomously (i.e. in the absence of Ds). A total of eight transposable element systems have been recognized in maize, the best characterized of which are Ac(Mp)Ds, Spm and Robertson's mutator \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13480736385212893017", "cites_id": ["13480736385212893017"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BI/BI9840307", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WUdMf1EyFbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
