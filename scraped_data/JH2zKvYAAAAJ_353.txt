The present study examined the relationship between lncRNA expression level and two active histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) in Brassica rapa. Both histone marks were enriched in the chromatin regions encoding lncRNAs, especially around the transcription start site. The transcription level of long intergenic noncoding RNAs was positively associated with the level of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, while this association was not observed in natural antisense RNAs (NATs) and intronic noncoding RNAs. As coordinate expression of mRNAs and paired NATs under biotic stress treatment has been identified, the transcriptional relationship between mRNAs and their paired NATs following Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans (Foc) inoculation was examined. A positive association of expression levels between mRNAs and their paired NATs following Foc inoculation was observed. This association held for several defense-response-related genes and their NAT pairs. These results suggest that coordinate expression of mRNAs and paired NATs plays a role in the defense response against Foc."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Vno172sVVMwC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11560195807133773420", "cites_id": ["11560195807133773420"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/8/1/17", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bC4ritYQbqAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
