The vigour of the Mimic and the hybrid are developmental changes. These Mimics could substitute for hybrid seed for planting.We have used two pre-existing high-yielding hybrid systems (FLY1 and DY527) to develop Hybrid Mimics. In the FLY1 hybrid system we selected, under field conditions, F6 lines which have high grain yields and biomass equivalent to the F1 hybrids, stable over subsequent F7, F8 and later generations. We have termed these lines Hybrid Mimics. The mimics are mostly homozygous as a consequence of selfing in each generation. We have repeated this selection procedure in the second independent hybrid system DY527, producing Mimics with similar characteristics to the F1 hybrid.
