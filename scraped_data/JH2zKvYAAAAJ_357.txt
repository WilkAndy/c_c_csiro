Chitinase induction in flax leaves in response to inoculation with flax rust, caused by Melampsora lini (Pers.) Lev., was investigated in a line of flax (Forge) that has four resistance genes, viz. L6, M, N and P2. Four avirulent rust strains, each of which interacts with just one of the resistance genes in Forge, as well as a strain that is virulent on Forge, were used. Thus chitinase levels associated with resistance reactions triggered by the L6, M, N or P2 genes, and by a susceptible reaction, have been compared in the same host genotype. A marked increase in chitinase activity in inoculated leaves was observed with all four resistance reactions, with the increase occurring earlier with the P2 resistance reaction compared with the L6, M, and N reactions. A moderate increase in chitinase activity was also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2174980294020958017", "cites_id": ["2174980294020958017"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1071/AP00058", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QQeYyg0VLx4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
