Approaches being tested draw upon successful methods established for yeast, Drosophila and animals. Direct transformation of microinjection of naked DNA requires suitable cells capable of regeneration or specialized recipient cells such as germinating pollen or developing ovules. Transposable genetic elements from maize are being adapted for integration for transforming DNA into plant genomes. Plant protoplast-bacterial spheroplast fusion may provide a delivery system but require appropriate monocot cell culture system. A requirement for gene transfer technology is the ability to isolate specific genes. Conventional approaches have relied upon DNA cloning, new approaches involve the ability to isolate genes from a characterization of small amounts of protein product or \"transposon mutagenesis\" for isolating genes for which we can only monitor phenotype"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8333847386869564516", "cites_id": ["8333847386869564516"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=XB8410314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZIStMgvGp3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1}}
