This has led to a great increase in our understanding of the molecular basis of both plant development and the response to environmental stimuli. Having the genome sequence has enabled genomics approaches which aim to assign a function to each of the predicted 26,000 genes. Knockout mutations generated by insertional mutagenesis or gene silencing with RNAi methodology suggest a function for a gene if the mutants can be linked to a phenotype. Oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the predicted genes can be spotted on a microarray which can be used to determine the pattern of expression of each of the genes, again, suggesting a function. The knowledge of gene function is deepening our understanding of development in Arabidopsis, and importantly, it is enabling Arabidopsis to be a platform into similar levels of understanding in our major crop plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12669586806454282518", "cites_id": ["12669586806454282518"], "pub_url": "http://www.cropscience.org.au/icsc2004/pdf/1957_dennise.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Fumu-RJq068J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
