Particularly, it was asked if gene expression following T-DNA transfer required DNA replication in the host cell. A \u03b2-glucuronidase gene, linked to a CaMV 35S promoter (35S-GUS, engineered so that it was inactive in Agrobacterium tumefaciens) was introduced into Nicotiana plumbaginifolia protoplasts via a disarmed supervirulent strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. High \u03b2-glucuronidase activity appeared after 3 days of co-cultivation. The activity required the presence of the vir functions of agrobacteria. The activity was drastically reduced if the plant cells were treated with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. While double-stranded (ds) 35S-GUS DNA, introduced by electroporation, showed undiminished expression in the presence of aphidicolin, gene expression from single-stranded (ss) 35S \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5743053373967698201", "cites_id": ["5743053373967698201"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/PP9940125", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GQl0mZ1ss08J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1}}
