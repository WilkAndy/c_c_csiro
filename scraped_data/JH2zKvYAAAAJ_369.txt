With a view towards the improvement of cereal quality by genetic engineering attention is beginning to focus on the identification and utilisation of promoters that will be used to control the expression of agronomically important traits in transformed cereals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17229407073176716095", "cites_id": ["17229407073176716095"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2441-0_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PwNNn3ImG-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2}}
