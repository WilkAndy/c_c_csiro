This information has lead us to view the transition to flowering as a progression of steps in a pathway that leads to the commitment of the shoot meristem (s) to form flowers. Once committed to floral development, in normal circumstances, these meristems produce floral organs in sequential order to give rise to fully developed flowers. It has long been proposed that alterations in gene expression are associated with the transition to flowering (for example, 13), and given the recent advances in molecular biology, we are now able to identify and isolate genes whose activity changes during developmental processes. This paper will summarize our recent studies of changes in gene expression during floral initiation. Most of the information about the flowering process has been derived from studies with a relatively few number of plant species, the majority of which display some dependence upon a particular photoperiodic regime in order to flower. The advantages of using a photoperiodic-dependent system for investigating flowering are obvious. Of equal interest is the mechanism of floral initiation in day-neutral (DN) plants which flower without requiring a particular photoperiodic treatment; such plants often appear to have an\" internal developmental clock\" which programs them to flower at a given developmental or physiological age. The various species of Nicotiana offer an experimental system possessing both DN and photoperiodic plants in which floral induction and floral meristem \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13962185635198885489", "cites_id": ["13962185635198885489"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13962185635198885489&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cV4XQtylw8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2}}
