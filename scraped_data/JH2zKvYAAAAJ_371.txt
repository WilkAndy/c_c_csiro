We cannot agree, as it is already clear that recombinant DNA technology will make impacts on plant production systems. Dia~ nostic tools will provide increased power to many selection schemes and Increased accuracy in the selection of appropriate parents in breeding programs. Genetic engineering should al:; o make direct contributions to plant improvement by providing additional means of introducing specific genes to the genetic structure of a cultivar. Gene addition should extend the life of many of our most efficient cultivars and enable them to be used in different and more marginal environments. It should enable a plant breeder to respond to yield limitation in a shorter time. It may also significantly reduce the scale of a plant breeding pro!~ am.
