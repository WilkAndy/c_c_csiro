Adh1 and Adh2 on maize chromosomes 1 and 4, respectively, convert acetaldehyde to ethanol, thereby generating NAD, which is essential for glycolytic ATP production under anaerobic conditions such as flooding. It is hoped that the transfer of Adh genes of maize into cells of plants or species lacking alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity will ensure the survival of these plants in an anaerobic environment. The cloning of cDNA of Adh1 and Adh2; the induction of ADH activity; the genomic organization of Adh1 and Adh2; and the expression and transfer of cloned Adh genes are briefly outlined."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15975423621698130286", "cites_id": ["15975423621698130286"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19841635603", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bpGzeyQbtN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
