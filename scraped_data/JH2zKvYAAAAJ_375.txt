In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), this gap is occluded by tufts of short unicellular trichomes superficially resembling the fibers found on cotton seeds. We are just beginning to understand the developmental regulation of the seed fibers and have previously characterized several MIXTA-like MYB transcription factors (TFs) that are critical for correct seed fiber development but know little about the molecular regulation of other types of cotton trichomes. Here, using RNAi or dominant suppression transgenic cotton lines and natural fiber mutants, we investigated the development and regulation of the petal base trichomes. Petal base trichomes and seed trichomes were also examined across several different species within \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:W2uZP3ddy8sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3632009650682705237", "cites_id": ["3632009650682705237"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/61/9/1590/5862021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VbW7uYh9ZzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
