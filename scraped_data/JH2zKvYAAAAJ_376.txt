A similar level of heterosis in all F1 individuals is expected as they are genetically identical. However, we found variation in rosette size in individual F1 plants from a cross between C24 and Columbia-0 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. Big-sized F1 plants had 26.1% larger leaf area in the first and second leaves than medium-sized F1 plants at 14 days after sowing in spite of the identical genetic background. We identified differentially expressed genes between big- and medium-sized F1 plants by microarray; genes involved in the category of stress response were overrepresented. We made transgenic plants overexpressing 21 genes, which were differentially expressed between the two size classes, and some lines had increased plant size at 14 or 21 days after sowing but not at all time points during development. Change of expression levels in stress-responsive genes among individual F1 plants could generate the variation in plant size of individual F1 plants in A. thaliana."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Azgs6IHzeyYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17629111818895789923", "cites_id": ["17629111818895789923"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/676132", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y4_s1ssvp_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
