Heynh callus tissue and broccoli nuclei. The synthesis of complementary RNA (cRNA) was independent of a RNA primer, whether or not the primer contained a 3\u2032 terminal 2\u2032-O-methyl group or was phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 terminus. cRNA synthesis in plant extracts was not affected by loss-of-function mutations in the DICER-LIKE (DCL) proteins DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4, indicating that RDRs function independently of these DCL proteins. A loss-of-function mutation in RDR1, RDR2 or RDR6 did not significantly reduce the amount of cRNA synthesis. This indicates that these RDRs did not account for the bulk RDR activities in plant extracts, and suggest that either the individual RDRs each contribute a fraction of polymerase activity or another RDR(s) is predominant in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11314593696153192433", "cites_id": ["11314593696153192433"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp08118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8ccV9QSDBZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
