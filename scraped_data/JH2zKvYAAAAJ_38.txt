We show that the time of highest sensitivity to cold coincides with the time of peak tapetal activity: the transition of the tetrad to early uni\u2010nucleate stage (young microspore, YM stage). Low temperatures at this stage of pollen development result in an accumulation of sucrose in the anthers, accompanied by decreased activity of cell wall bound acid invertase and depletion of starch in mature pollen grains. Expression analysis of two cell wall (OSINV1, 4) and one vacuolar (OSINV2) acid invertase genes showed that OSINV4 is anther\u2010specific and down\u2010regulated by cold treatment. OSINV4 is transiently expressed in the tapetum cell layer at the YM stage, and later from the early binucleate stage in the maturing microspores. The down\u2010regulation of OSINV4 expression in the tapetum at YM may cause a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 323, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16641383501191852864", "cites_id": ["16641383501191852864"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01390.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QDOW3x8S8uYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 7, "2009": 3, "2010": 17, "2011": 11, "2012": 15, "2013": 22, "2014": 20, "2015": 20, "2016": 20, "2017": 19, "2018": 17, "2019": 39, "2020": 18, "2021": 31, "2022": 31, "2023": 20}}
