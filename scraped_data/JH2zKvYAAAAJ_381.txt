In genomics, the focus of research has shifted from studying individual genes to studying all the genes in an organism. In plants, genomics has been very dependent on the use of two model organisms, Arabidopsis as a general model and model for dicots and rice as model for the cereals.There are different stages in the study of genomics. A landmark stage is obtaining the complete genome sequence of an organism. On the way to the genome sequence there is usually a physical map developed with as many DNA markers as possible. For example, in rice there are some 3,500 DNA markers (RFLP, AFLP or SSP markers) scattered over the genome. This physical map is integrated with the genetic map and is of great use for linking phenotype with genotype and QTLs. Concurrent with the production of a physical map, the whole genome DNA is broken up into small pieces of about 100 KB and each is cloned as a \u2018BAC\u2019or bacterial artificial chromosome in bacteria. A library of bacteria each with one BAC containing one genome segment is produced. These BACS are ordered so that every region of the genome is covered by a BAC and each BAC is from a known position in the genome. BACS are then sequenced, leading to the complete genome sequence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11058947818276695978", "cites_id": ["11058947818276695978"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/abts/2001/m4/dennis.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qq_2qXJGeZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
