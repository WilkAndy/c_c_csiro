Some of these have not withstood rigorous testing, and it appears that many early reports of wheat transformation may have resulted from experimental artefact. We have evaluated two methods for wheat transformation: direct gene transfer to protoplasts and transformation of intact tissues with DNA-coated microparticles. While both methods have yielded transformed wheat tissue, each has its advantages and disadvantages. On balance, microparticle bombardment of freshly initiated cultures is the preferred method for wheat transformation as it avoids the necessity of establishing the longer term embryo-genic cultures required for protoplast isolation, and it results in the recovery of a high proportion of phenotypically normal plants from the transformed materials."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7210953911684398326", "cites_id": ["7210953911684398326"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2441-0_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9nypnWB0EmQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1}}
