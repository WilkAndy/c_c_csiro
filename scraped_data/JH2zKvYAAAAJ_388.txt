The plasmid band was also present in ineffective mutants and non-infective mutants derived from symbiotically effective, plasmid-carrying parent strains. The buoyant density in caesium chloride was 1\u00b7 719 g/cm3 for chromosomal DNA and 1\u00b7 715-1\u00b7 716 g/cm3 for plasmid DNA in the four strains examined. Electron microscopy of the CCC-DNA from five strains revealed a wide size range of large circular molecules, with the contour length ranging from l3. 5 to c. 170 jim (mol. wt range 28 x 106-352 x 106 ). Analysis of the size distribution of open circular molecules from the five strains indicated that a multimeric series of plasmid molecules may occur in these bacteria, with an estimated mean monomer length of l3\u00b75 jlin."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11106004528147428119", "cites_id": ["11106004528147428119"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/BI/BI9790651", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F3MbtkZ0IJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 2}}
