RAP2.2 is expressed at constitutively high levels in the roots and at lower levels in the shoots, where it is induced by darkness. Effector studies and analysis of ethylene signal transduction mutants indicate that RAP2.2 is induced in shoots by ethylene and functions in an ethylene-controlled signal transduction pathway. Overexpression of RAP2.2 resulted in improved plant survival under hypoxia (low-oxygen) stress, whereas lines containing T-DNA knockouts of the gene had poorer survival rates than the wild type. This indicates that RAP2.2 is important in a plant's ability to resist hypoxia stress. Observation of the expression pattern of 32 low-oxygen and ethylene-associated genes showed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 319, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7276955266653990507", "cites_id": ["7276955266653990507"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/153/2/757/6109639", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a65Rk0Lw_GQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 23, "2012": 25, "2013": 28, "2014": 26, "2015": 26, "2016": 24, "2017": 22, "2018": 20, "2019": 25, "2020": 26, "2021": 28, "2022": 36, "2023": 9}}
