As hybrids have led to large increases in yield in other crops, we examined the possibility of using hybrids in lentils. In 52 hybrids between Australian commercial cultivars and lines from a global collection of cultivated and wild accessions, we found 15 of the hybrids had seed yield hybrid vigor, with better parent heterosis (BPH) gains ranging from 10.4 to 125%. Flowering time, seed size, cotyledon color, and branch number were important but not critical for the level of hybrid vigor in seed yield. Plant height at 28 days post sowing (dps) could be an indicator of seed yield vigor of hybrids grown in glasshouse conditions. In the absence of male sterile lines in lentils, we used high\u2010yielding hybrid combinations in a program of repeated selfing and selection to produce stable, high\u2010yielding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:3A3nxV7CjKIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8355128480771308770", "cites_id": ["8355128480771308770"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/csc2.20777", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4nwf_RVh83MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
