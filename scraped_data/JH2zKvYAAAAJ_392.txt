In plants, DNA methylation is observed in the symmetric CG and CHG contexts as well as the asymmetric CHH context (where H is A, C, or T). DNA methylation states are stably inherited and play a role in transcriptional regulation not only of protein coding genes but also of transposable elements (TEs)(Fujimoto et al., 2012; Kawakatsu and Ecker, 2019). Intraspecific variation of DNA methylation states indicates the occurrence of spontaneous changes in DNA methylation. Three classes of epigenetic variation have been defined (Richards, 2006).\u201cObligatory\u201d epigenetic variation is completely dependent on DNA sequence change; an example of this is transposon-associated epigenetic change.\u201cFacilitated\u201d epigenetic variation is caused by stochastic variation in epigenetic states and change of DNA methylation state in hypomethylated mutants is an example.\u201cPure\u201d epigenetic variation is generated stochastically and is completely independent of DNA sequence (Richards, 2006). In the genus Arabidopsis, there is a variation in the number of tandem repeats in the promoter region of FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA) between related species, and DNA methylated regions are enlarged by the generation of tandem repeats. Therefore, this falls under \u201cobligatory\u201d epigenetic variation (Figure 1)(Fujimoto et al., 2008). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter region of FWA is highly methylated and FWA expression is silenced, while in the hypomethylated mutants, there is no DNA methylation in the promoter region and FWA \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:3lUAU8Oskd0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17265669844140055578", "cites_id": ["17265669844140055578"], "pub_url": "https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/53d51869-454d-4f44-a04c-bc268ad19f82/PubMedCentral/53d51869-454d-4f44-a04c-bc268ad19f82.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Glwk7T77m-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
