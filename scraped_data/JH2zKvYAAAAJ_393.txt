A genomewide approach is essential to achieve this mammoth task, which would involve structural similarity studies, expression profiling, production of gene knockouts and gene expression knockouts, and mutant phenotyping. One of the most direct approaches to determine gene function is production of insertion mutations and study of their effects on the plant\u2019s phenotype. In these insertion lines, the inactivated gene contains a known insertion sequence, which simplifies the task of isolating this gene, as it effectively has been \u201ctagged\u201d by the inserted sequence.The incorporation of reporter gene trapping capacities within the inserted element will, in addition to producing gene \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4667810226906238050", "cites_id": ["4667810226906238050"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4667810226906238050&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yoyulatkx0AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
