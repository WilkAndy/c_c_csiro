Hygromycin counter selection could identify the possible stable trap lines that did not contain Ac and in which Ds had jumped to locations unlinked to their original positions. However, high-throughput screening requires quick and efficient selection of stable Ds trap lines, linked or unlinked to their original positions, from among the large screening population. We have evaluated two negative selectors, tms2 (iaaH) under the control of the manopine synthase gene 2 promoter from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and codA driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, for use in rice. The former was found to be suitable for rice and an Ac construct with tms2 as a negative selector has been employed. In the Ds enhancer and gene trap constructs, the nptll gene has been replaced with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6518958480002313558", "cites_id": ["6518958480002313558"], "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812814319_0136", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vu0O2jL-d1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1}}
