Maize grown under aerobic conditions shows only low levels of ADH in most organs of the plant, although ADH1 is produced constitutively in embryo, endosperm, and pollen (Freeling and Bennett 1985). When plants are subjected to anaerobic stress, both ADH1 and ADH2 are induced in the roots (Freeling and Schwartz 1973), but not in mature green leaf tissues (Okimoto et al. 1980). There is some synthesis of ADH1 and ADH2 in cultured cells, possibly as a result of relatively hypoxic conditions under which the cultures are maintained. These levels are further increased by anaerobic treatment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6626743083641395213", "cites_id": ["6626743083641395213"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-57968-4_30", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ddg4frnr9lsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
