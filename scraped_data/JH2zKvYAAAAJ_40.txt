FT is a promoter of flowering activated by long days and by warm conditions. FLC represses FT to delay flowering until plants experience winter.The identification of genes controlling flowering in cereals allows comparison of the molecular pathways controlling seasonal flowering-responses in cereals with those of arabidopsis. The role of FT has been conserved between arabidopsis and cereals; FT-like genes trigger flowering in response to short days in rice or long days in temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Many varieties of wheat and barley require vernalization to flower but FLC-like genes have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 316, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4317826208372065603", "cites_id": ["4317826208372065603"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/103/8/1165/178792", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q4XjRw8A7DsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 6, "2010": 21, "2011": 23, "2012": 30, "2013": 32, "2014": 32, "2015": 25, "2016": 30, "2017": 23, "2018": 21, "2019": 23, "2020": 20, "2021": 9, "2022": 15, "2023": 4}}
