McClintock also recognized the existence of Ds (Dissociation) elements which could transpose, but only in the presence of a trans-acting Ac element elsewhere in the genome. DNA sequences corresponding to Ds and Ac have now been identified, and an understanding of many of the properties of these transposable elements in the maize genome has been acquired in recent years.It is known that cryptic Ac elements and members of at least two families of Ds elements occur in the genome of all maize lines examined. Ds elements also occur in Teosinte and the more distantly related Tripsacum. We discuss the possible origin of these elements and consider the mechanism of activation of cryptic Ac \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2416573262522461524", "cites_id": ["2416573262522461524"], "pub_url": "https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-abstract/1987/Supplement_7/123/58076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VK1bJpRkiSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
