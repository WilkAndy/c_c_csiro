Resistant and susceptible cultivars in B. rapa vegetables have different immune responses against A. candida inoculation, however, the mechanism of how host plants respond to A. candida is still unknown. Using RNA-sequencing, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between A. candida inoculated [48 and 72 h after inoculation (HAI)] and non-inoculated samples in resistant and susceptible cultivars of komatsuna (B. rapa var. perviridis). Functional DEGs differed between the resistant and susceptible cultivars in A. candida inoculated samples. Salicylic acid (SA) responsive genes tended to be changed in their expression levels by A. candida inoculation in both resistant and susceptible cultivars, but different genes were identified in the two cultivars.
