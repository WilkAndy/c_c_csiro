To identify SA responsive genes at the whole genome level, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis with and without SA treatment in two komatsuna cultivars (Brassica rapa var. perviridis). We identified 1,061 up-and 994 downregulated genes that overlapped between the two cultivars, and these genes were defined as B. rapa SA-induced genes (BrSAIGs) and B. rapa SA-suppressed genes (BrSASGs), respectively. In this study, we identified genes overlapping between BrSAIGs/BrSASGs and paired genes overlapping natural antisense transcripts (NATs) or intronic noncoding RNAs (incRNAs) in their encoding regions. Thirty-three mRNA/NAT pairs and three mRNA/incRNA pairs were identified.
