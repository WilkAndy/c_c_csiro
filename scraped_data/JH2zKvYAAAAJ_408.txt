Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) are classified by their position and orientation of transcription. There are long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), intronic noncoding RNAs (incRNAs) derived from introns, and natural antisense transcripts (NATs) transcribed from the cDNA strand of their associated genes. Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs play crucial roles in abiotic and biotic stress responses. However, studies on the mechanism of lncRNA expression regulation are limited in plants. In this study, we identified lncRNAs with dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2) marks in their genomic region. There were fewer lncRNAs with H3K9me2 marks in their encoding regions than with the other histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K36me3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.actahort.org/books/1362/1362_10.htm", "cites_per_year": {}}
