The application of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides an opportunity to identify genome-wide profiles of histone modification by a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genome-wide sequencing (ChIP-seq). We investigated the distribution of two active histone marks, trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and trimethylation of lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me3), in Brassica rapa L. by ChIP-seq. H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks were enriched at the transcription start site of genes, and the transcription level of a gene was positively associated with the level of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. In this study, we compared H3K4me3 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:q0uBw5dMOAkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.actahort.org/books/1362/1362_15.htm", "cites_per_year": {}}
