This book is a companion volume to the proceedings of the 1965 inaugural meeting of IAUP, also published by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. The highlight of the 50th Anniversary Meeting was an academic conference at Oxford University on the theme of \u201cHigher Education in 2065.\u201d Participants were called upon to look ahead to the next fifty years of global higher education, drawing from their academic fields, as well as their leadership experience within and beyond higher education. The resulting collection includes discussions of current trends that will impact the future of universities, as well as discussions of specific challenges likely to face higher education institutions, both generally and in particular regions. Some contributors outline steps that higher education institutions and/or policymakers should adopt today to prepare for those challenges, while others imagine the university of the future. Edited by IAUP secretary-general emeritus Jason Scorza, this book is dedicated to the memory of J. Michael Adams, who served both as president of Fairleigh Dickinson University and president of IAUP, and includes some of his final writings on the topic of the future of global higher education. Founded in 1965, IAUP is the world\u2019s largest association of university chief executives from higher education institutions. Membership is limited to individuals who serve or have served as presidents, rectors, or vice-chancellors at accredited colleges or universities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:PQEM9vzQD9gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Q4UnDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:_puhp7mCM_cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=k01bdPJeUf&sig=3zLmt1JUI_wbcS5Q8shptewpowg", "cites_per_year": {}}
