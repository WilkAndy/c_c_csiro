In general, mutations are associated with changes of nucleotide sequence, and many mutations in genes that can cause changes in plant development have been identified. Epigenetic change, which does not involve alteration to the nucleotide sequence, can also cause changes in gene activity by changing the structure of chromatin through DNA methylation or histone modifications. Now there is evidence based on induced or spontaneous mutants that epigenetic changes can cause altering plant phenotypes. Epigenetic changes have occurred frequently in plants, and some are heritable or metastable causing variation in epigenetic status within or between species. Therefore, heritable epigenetic variation as well as genetic variation has the potential to drive natural variation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:eH23hyXCXa4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ20210484405", "cites_per_year": {}}
