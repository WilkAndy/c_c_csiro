In Arabidopsis, leaf trichome initiation is regulated by a group of well\u2010defined transcription factors that includes MYB and homeodomain types. Many MYBs are expressed in fibres, but their roles in fibre development remain unclear. We analysed the function of one MYB transcription factor, GhMYB25, identified from transcriptome comparisons between wild\u2010type and fibreless cotton mutants. A GhMYB25 promoter\u2010GUS construct in transgenic cotton was expressed in the epidermis of ovules, developing fibre initials and fibres, in the trichomes of a number of tissues including leaves, stems and petals, as well as in the anthers, pollen and the epidermal layers of roots and root initials, but not in root hairs. Cotton is an allotetraploid with two very similar GhMYB25 genes that were silenced by a single \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 310, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=433960438064159097", "cites_id": ["433960438064159097"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03847.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eRljHbi8BQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 10, "2011": 14, "2012": 15, "2013": 20, "2014": 20, "2015": 31, "2016": 22, "2017": 18, "2018": 22, "2019": 13, "2020": 26, "2021": 44, "2022": 30, "2023": 24}}
