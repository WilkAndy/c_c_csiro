To study the role of RNA silencing in plant defence against Fusarium wilt, we have utilised the large collection of mutants available in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Approximately~ 30 Arabidopsis mutants, each carrying a different defective RNA silencing gene, were screened for their susceptibility (resistance) to the fungal wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans (Foc). Some mutant plants show few signs of fungal wilt symptoms (characterised typically by leaf chlorosis) after 16 days post-infection. These mutants carry defects in genes which have been shown to play a role in the biogenesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and are required for silencing transgenes derived from plant pathogens. We have also performed a microarray experiment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP101738&sb=RECENT&n=19&rpp=50&page=26&tr=5484&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
