A major component of waterlogging stress is the lack of oxygen available in the rhizosphere. We assessed cotton growth responses to waterlogging and assayed global gene transcription responses in root and leaf cotton tissues of partially submerged plants. Waterlogging caused significant reductions in stem elongation, shoot mass, root mass and leaf number, and altered the expression of 1,012 genes in root tissue as early as 4 h after flooding. Many of these genes were associated with cell wall modification and growth pathways, glycolysis, fermentation, mitochondrial electron transport and nitrogen metabolism. Waterlogging of plant roots also altered global gene expression in leaf tissues, significantly changing the expression of 1,305 genes after 24 h of flooding. Genes affected were associated with cell wall growth and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:unp9ATQDT5gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP101735&sb=RECENT&n=26&rpp=50&page=64&tr=5490&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2010", "cites_per_year": {}}
