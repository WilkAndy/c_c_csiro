Two seasonal cues that promote flowering of temperate cereals are prolonged exposure to low temperatures (vernalization) and long days. Vernalization is a prerequisite for the long-day response, so long-day promotion of flowering occurs after winter as days lengthen in spring. By examining interactions between genes controlling vernalization requirement and daylength responses we have been able to describe how low-temperature and long-day flowering responses are integrated in cereals. The low-temperature response is mediated by VERNALIZATION1(VRN1), a FRUITFULL-like MADS box gene. VRN1 is induced by prolonged exposure to low temperatures and acts in the shoot apex to promote inflorescence initiation. VRN1 also acts in leaves to allow vernalized plants to respond to long days. We will present data to support our model of integration of flowering pathways in cereals and briefly compare the regulatory mechanisms controlling flowering time in cereals with those of Arabidopsis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3280/O50.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aa6vYSIOsrUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
