In varieties that require vernalization to flower, VRN1 is expressed at low basal levels and is induced by exposure to low temperatures3, 6, 8, 11. Deletions in the first intron of VRN1 cause increased VRN1 activity in the absence of cold treatment and reduce the vernalization requirement3, 8, 11. We assayed the extent of natural variation in the first intron of the HvVRN1 gene amongst four thousand barleys from diverse geographical regions. Twelve alleles of HvVRN1 containing deletions or insertions in the first intron were identified, including five alleles that have not been described previously. Comparison of the position and length of deletions in the first intron of HvVRN1 has allowed us to identify a region that is required for repression of this gene prior to winter and a correlation between the position and length of deletions and HvVRN1 expression levels. We also show that deletion of this region does not prevent induction of HvVRN1 by low temperatures. We suggest that a specific region within the first intron of HvVRN1 is required to maintain low levels of HvVRN1 expression prior to winter but acts independently of the regulatory mechanisms that allow low-temperature induction of HvVRN1 during winter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/3360/P268.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hxZFeWV2zXAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
