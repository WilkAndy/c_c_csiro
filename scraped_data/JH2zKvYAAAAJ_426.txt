The embryo arrest can be rescued by pollination with a hypomethylated paternal gene (Vielle-Calzada et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2000; Vinkenoog et al., 2000). In this study, we show that reduced methylation of the female genome cannot rescue the fis embryo arrest phenotype."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6635-1_16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hRsNcIUq4tUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
