It is based on a truncated maize Adh1 promoter, with multiple copies of the Anaerobic Responsive Element from the maize Adh1 gene and ocs-elements from the octopine synthase gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The pEmu promoter was one of 12 different promoter constructs that were linked to the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene. Promoter activity was measured 48 h after introduction of the constructs into protoplasts of five different monocot species [wheat, maize, rice, einkorn (Triticum monococcum), and Lolium multiflorum] and one dicot (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia). In suspension cell protoplasts, the most highly expressing construct (pEmuGN) gave 10- to 50-fold higher expression than the CaMV 35S promoter in all the monocot species. The pEmu promoter should be valuable where a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 307, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13509390727460870425", "cites_id": ["13509390727460870425"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00226722", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GdlCckr_ersJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 10, "1993": 15, "1994": 21, "1995": 20, "1996": 12, "1997": 10, "1998": 14, "1999": 14, "2000": 14, "2001": 15, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 5, "2010": 13, "2011": 16, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 14, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 12, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
