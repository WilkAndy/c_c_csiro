Apomixis comprises an ensemble of developmental processes that together alter the reproductive functions in the ovule of flowering plants, converting the sexual programme to an asexual one. The result of these alterations is that the apomictically derived embryo is not a product of male and female gamete fusion as occurs in sexual reproduction but is derived solely from cells in maternal ovule tissues."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1038/npg.els.0002035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wtnP_HlCjD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
