Named adr for alcohol dehydrogenase regulatory, these lines were obtained during allyl alcohol selection of seeds from a transgenic line (DGTS04/04) containing one extra copy of the complete ADH1 gene as a transgene. Recovery of ADH1 expression after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and the demonstration with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes that ADH1 is methylated, indicated that defective expression was due to an increase in methylation rather than a mutation. This phenomenon may occur when genes are transformed to plants that have a homologous copy of the transgene in its genome, and it is called homology-dependent gene silencing (HdGS). Nuclear run-on studies with nuclei isolated from the silent lines showed that silencing is post-transcriptional, which postulates a qualitative (aberrant) feature of the nascent transcripts as a likely molecular switch for ADH1 silencing"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=PT2004000399", "cites_per_year": {}}
