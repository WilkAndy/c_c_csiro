Induction of pollen sterility by cold involves a disruption of sugar transport in anthers, caused by the cold-induced repression of the apoplastic sugar transport pathway in the tapetum. Here we demonstrate that the phytohormone ABA is a potential signal for cold-induced pollen sterility (CIPS). Cold treatment of the cold-sensitive cultivar Doongara resulted in increased anther ABA levels. Exogenous ABA treatment at the young microspore stage induced pollen sterility and affected cell wall invertase and monosaccharide transporter gene expression in a way similar to cold treatment. In the cold-tolerant cultivar R31, ABA levels were significantly lower under normal circumstances and remained low after cold treatment. The differences in endogenous ABA levels in Doongara and R31 correlated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 304, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5240767412314438672", "cites_id": ["5240767412314438672"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/48/9/1319/1815364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EPxx2THyukgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 16, "2013": 22, "2014": 23, "2015": 22, "2016": 17, "2017": 15, "2018": 16, "2019": 33, "2020": 28, "2021": 26, "2022": 33, "2023": 14}}
