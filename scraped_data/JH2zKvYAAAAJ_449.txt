Heynh. is inducible by the environmental stresses anaerobiosis, dehydration and low temperature. Analysis of the Adh promoter using 5'-deletion and substitution mutants has allowed the identification of promoter elements which interact differentially under the different stress conditions. One element, located between positions\u2013160 and\u2013140, consists of a GT/GC-rich motif and functions as a general stress responsive element (GSRE). The G-box-1 sequence (\u2013216 to\u2013209) is necessary only for cold and dehydration induction. We have started to dissect the signal transduction pathways involved in the different environmental stress responses,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:wLxue7F8ec0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2839078651859089402&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-rd05f1uZicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
