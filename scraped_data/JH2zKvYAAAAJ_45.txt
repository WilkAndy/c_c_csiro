E., Bagnall, D. J., Metzger, J. M., Dennis, E. S. & Peacock, W. J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 287\u2013291]. Arabidopsis plants that have reduced levels of DNA methylation because of the presence of a methyltransferase (METI) antisense gene flowered earlier than untransformed control plants, without the need for a cold treatment. Decreased DNA methylation mutants (ddm1) also flowered earlier than the wild-type progenitor under conditions where they respond to vernalization. We conclude that demethylation of DNA is sufficient to cause early flowering, and we have found that the promotion of flowering is directly proportional to the decrease in methylation in METI antisense lines. The early-flowering phenotype was inherited in sexual progeny \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 303, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17778282479666610359", "cites_id": ["17778282479666610359"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.95.10.5824", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t0AUzbglufYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 7, "2000": 15, "2001": 7, "2002": 20, "2003": 22, "2004": 8, "2005": 15, "2006": 13, "2007": 12, "2008": 16, "2009": 7, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 15, "2013": 15, "2014": 21, "2015": 15, "2016": 17, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
