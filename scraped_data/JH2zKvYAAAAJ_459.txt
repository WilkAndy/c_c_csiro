The tobacco Thin Cell Layer (TCL) tissue culture system provides a method of obtaining such material at well defined developmental stages. The TCL system was developed by K. Tran Thanh Van as an experimental system to study organogensis in vitro, and thus reduce the confusion introduced by the environment of the whole plant.\" Thin Cell Layers\" are tissue expiants consisting of epidermal, sub-epidermal, and parenchyma cells. Expiants stripped from the floral branches of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) can be induced to form root initials, vegetative buds, or floral buds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10986744157617901481&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
