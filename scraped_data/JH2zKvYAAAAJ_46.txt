We examined whether daylength regulates expression of HvVRN1 and HvVRN2. In a vernalization-responsive winter barley (Hordeum vulgare), expression of HvVRN1 is regulated by vernalization and by development, but not by daylength. Daylength affected HvVRN1 expression in only one of six vernalization-insensitive spring barleys examined and so cannot be a general feature of regulation of this gene. In contrast, daylength is the major determinant of expression levels of two ZCCT genes found at the barley VRN2 locus, HvZCCTa and HvZCCTb. In winter barley, high levels of HvZCCTa and HvZCCTb expression were detected only when plants were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 289, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15062809060844497638", "cites_id": ["15062809060844497638"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/140/4/1397/6115043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5uor3wjZCdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 13, "2008": 25, "2009": 24, "2010": 18, "2011": 19, "2012": 23, "2013": 19, "2014": 28, "2015": 18, "2016": 24, "2017": 13, "2018": 10, "2019": 11, "2020": 16, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
