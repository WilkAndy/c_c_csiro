Blocks of heterochromatin have long arrays of tandemly arranged repeats, and usually such heterochromatic regions will have more than one highly repeated sequence species represented (Appels and Peacock, 1978). Heterochromatin has many effects at an intranuclear level and at other biological levels, but mostly blocks of heterochromatin appear not to be essential for viability. This led originally, in Drosophila, to the concept that it was genetically inert chromatin (see Hilliker and Appels, 1980). However, it is not a general case that blocks of heterochromatin are dispensable. For example, Hilliker (1976) has established that there are at least thirteen essential loci in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 2 in Drosophila melanogaster. His analysis indicated that the essential loci were single copy genes so that the repeated sequences, per se, in the heterochromatin may still be nonessential. Nevertheless, even where there are no single copy loci detectable, as for example in heterochromatin of the X chromosome in Drosophila, there are a number of specific effects attributable to heterochromatin and presumably to its highly repeated DNA sequences. For example, there are severe perturbations in chromosome pairing in spermatocytes and to sperm development, when certain blocks of X chromosome heterochromatin are deleted (Peacock et al., 1975). In the Y chromosome there is seemingly a 1: 1 correlation with the position of male fertility \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:h168fVGZblEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3477212534192606186&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6gsWdWCKQTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
