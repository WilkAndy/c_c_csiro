Although a number of gene transfer systems exist for animal cells, the only successful approach in plants is based on the Crown Gall inducing organism, Agrobaaterium twnefaciens. This bacterium contains a plasmid, part of which is incorporated into host chromosomes in the transformation event (1). It is possible to insert exogenous genes into the T-DNA segment of the plasmid and have these cointegrated into host plant chromosomes (2). However this system is limited to certain dicotyledonous species and has additional disadvantages of being associated with abnormal growth patterns, instability of incorporated sequences and low levels of transcription. Some of these difficulties may be overcome but it is not clear that the T-DNA method will be able to be applied to monocotyledons, which include all the important cereal crops. The alcohol dehydrogenase genes of maize (3) could provide the basis of a selectable gene transfer system in a wide array of plant species, both mono-and dicotyledons. The Adh genes, Adhl and Adh2 on chromosomes 1 and 4 respectively, convert acetaldehyde to ethanol, thereby regenerating NAD\" 1\", essential for glycolytic ATP production during anaerobiosis (see review, 4).
