We present data showing that the ga3-1 mutant is deficient in ent-kaurene oxidase activity, the first cytochrome P450-mediated step in the gibberellin biosynthetic pathway. By using a combination of conventional map-based cloning and random sequencing we identified a putative cytochrome P450 gene mapping to the same location as GA3. Relative to the progenitor line, two ga3 mutant alleles contained single base changes generating in-frame stop codons in the predicted amino acid sequence of the P450. A genomic clone spanning the P450 locus complemented the ga3-2 mutant. The deduced GA3 protein defines an additional class of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The GA3 gene was expressed in all tissues examined, RNA abundance being highest in inflorescence tissue."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 287, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1301297592351271195", "cites_id": ["1301297592351271195"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.95.15.9019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GykrA0QjDxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 14, "2000": 13, "2001": 16, "2002": 16, "2003": 12, "2004": 12, "2005": 13, "2006": 16, "2007": 6, "2008": 17, "2009": 16, "2010": 7, "2011": 9, "2012": 15, "2013": 7, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 15}}
