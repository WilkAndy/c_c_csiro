In the maize BMS cell line the dominant ocs-element binding activity is the ocs-element transcription factor complex called OTF. The isolation of cDNA clones from a BMS cDNA expression library for two bZlP (basic region-leucine zipper) proteins that bind the ocs-element sequence and are good candidates for forming at least part of OTF is described. The two ocselement binding proteins, called OBF3. 1 and OBF3. 2, are closely related, with the OBF3. 1 protein sharing 95.8% amino acid homology with part of the OBF3. 2 protein although there were significant differences in the 3'untranslated regions. Genomic Southern blot analysis revealed a small gene family with a minimum of two OBF3 loci mapping to chromosomes 3L105 and 8L075. The OBF3. 1 protein shared considerable homology with the wheat HBPl b protein (80% amino acid identity) and to a lesser extent with the tobacco TGAla protein. OBF3. 1 like HBPl b was able to bind well to the Hex sequence but poorly to G-box/ABRE sequences. Interestingly, OBF3. 1 bound eightfold more efficiently to an ocs-element sequence than TGAla, raising the possibility that OBF3. 1 and TGAla may be distinct members of an OBF3/TGA subfamily."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:QaSi33NTfwYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/49386222/j.1365-313x.1993.00669.x20161005-30681-1qakjgc.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oPIsny3aFwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
