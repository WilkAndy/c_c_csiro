DNA sequences required for the expression of Adh1 have been identified by a functional analysis of in vitro constructed hybrid genes consisting of the Adh1 promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding region. A series of 5\u2032 deletions, 3\u2032 deletions, hybrid promoters, and linker scanning mutants of the Adh-CAT hybrid gene were introduced into maize protoplasts by electroporation and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity after incubation of the protoplasts under different oxygen tensions. The results indicate that a 40-base-pair DNA sequence within the Adh1 promoter is required for anaerobically regulated expression of the hybrid gene. Clustered point mutations in this sequence show that it is composed of two essential regions, each \u224815 base \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 287, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18302743343024806802", "cites_id": ["18302743343024806802"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.84.19.6624", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kpsjMBloAP4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 13, "1989": 21, "1990": 19, "1991": 29, "1992": 12, "1993": 16, "1994": 14, "1995": 12, "1996": 8, "1997": 9, "1998": 10, "1999": 5, "2000": 7, "2001": 5, "2002": 8, "2003": 8, "2004": 9, "2005": 8, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
