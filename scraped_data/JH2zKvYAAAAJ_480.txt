We examined how ambient temperature influences reproductive development in the temperate cereals wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). High temperature resulted in rapid progression through reproductive development in long days, but inhibited early stages of reproductive development in short days. Activation of the long-day flowering response pathway through day-lengthinsensitive alleles of the PHOTOPERIOD1 gene, which result in high FLOWERING LOCUS T-likel transcript levels, did not allow rapid early reproductive development at high temperature in short days. Furthermore, high temperature did not increase transcript levels of FLOWERING LOCUS T-like genes. These data suggest that genes or pathways other than the longday response pathway mediate developmental responses to high temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/41435338?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wwmZ7xKVvTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
