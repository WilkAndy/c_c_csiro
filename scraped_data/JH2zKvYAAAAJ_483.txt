They can be as simple as single substitutions of one base in the DNA for another base, deletions of parts of the DNA or additions of DNA sequences in that particular region of the chromosome. These DNA sequence differences can either be within genes or nextto genes and are detected by simple physical assays for the size of a band on a gel, for example. Following the inheritance of the DNA band (marker) in different progeny plants is functionally the same as following the inheritance of the DNA sequence difference and hence of the gene (s) within or adjacent to which they occur. The DNA marker does not have to be responsible for a genetic"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6352487514178394602&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
