Using a backcross-derived mapping family of 41 BC5F2 lines, Nax1 was determined as a single genetic locus (Fig. 1). In this study, we used wESTs previously mapped to physical deletion bins in \u2018Chinese Spring\u2019wheat as a source of potential markers. The microsatellite gwm312 marker was mapped to the deletion bin flow length (FL) 0.77 to 0.85 (Fig. 2). The position of gwm312 defines the physical interval for Nax1, indicating that the gene was located somewhere between the centromere and distal breakpoint FL 0.85 on chromosome 2AL. Seventy-four wESTs had been mapped into the same physical region that had significant DNA sequence homology to rice genes in the syntenic region of 17.8 to 34.4 Mb on rice chromosome 4L (http://wheat. pwusda. gov/NSF/progress_mapping. html). The putative order for those 74 wESTs was inferred from the corresponding rice gene order and used as basis for developing RFLP markers in durum wheat (Table I). Initially, we selected three wEST markers (A, B, and C) for mapping because the related rice genes spanned the central region of rice chromosome 4L (24.1, 24.2, and 26.9 Mb; see Table I). Both A and B detected polymorphic markers between the donor Line 149 and the recurrent parent Tamaroi. However, only the Tamaroi alleles were present in the BC4 parental line and in the BC5F2 family, suggesting that this chromosomal region was replaced by Tamaroi during the process of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/49952177/A_Sodium_Transporter_HKT7_Is_a_Candida20161028-6317-qxx7hf.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1ihbm4HBJRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
