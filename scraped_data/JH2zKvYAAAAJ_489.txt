These authors test a novel T-DNA vector based on the RNA silencing concept that increases the chance of obtaining transgenic plants with a single T-DNA insertion.Nodules of tropical legumes are ideal for studying the purine biosynthesis pathway, for determining aspects of its subcellular localisation and for the isolation of pathway enzymes and the genes encoding them. This paper details work characterising the alternative splicing of the transcript of pur3 from cowpea, and the localisation of its protein product. The authors show that several different mRNAs are produced from this gene, and correct previous work on the soybean homologue of this gene, to suggest that the different transcripts seen may not have originated from different genes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/FPv32n8toc", "cites_per_year": {}}
