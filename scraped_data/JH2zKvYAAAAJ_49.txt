This repression bears the hallmark of an epigenetic event: the low expression state is maintained over many cell division cycles, but expression is derepressed in progeny. We show that the two stages of the response of FLC to vernalization, the repression of FLC and the maintenance of the repression during growth at normal temperatures after vernalization, are mediated through different regions of the FLC gene. Both promoter and intragenic regions are required for the responses. We also identify a 75-bp region in the FLC promoter that, in addition to intragenic sequences, is required for expression in nonvernalized plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4011017161025258019", "cites_id": ["4011017161025258019"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/14/10/2527/6009843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IwLoTtv-qTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 12, "2004": 18, "2005": 14, "2006": 21, "2007": 21, "2008": 21, "2009": 10, "2010": 8, "2011": 22, "2012": 22, "2013": 14, "2014": 17, "2015": 14, "2016": 8, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
