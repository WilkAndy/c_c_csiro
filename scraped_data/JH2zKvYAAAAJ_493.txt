Nature 324, 166-168; Bogusz et al.(1988). Nature 331, 178-1801. The promoters of these genes have been linked to a 8-glucuronidase reporter gene and introduced into both the nonlegume Nicotiana tabacum and the legume Lotus corniculatus. 60th promoters directed root-specific expression in transgenic tobacco. When transgenic Lotus plants were nodulated by Rhizobium loti, both promoter constructs showed a high level of nodule-specific expression confined to the central bacteroidcontaining portion of the nodule corresponding to the expression seen for the endogenous Lotus leghemoglobin gene. The T. tomentosa promoter was also expressed at a low level in the vascular tissue of the Lotus roots. The hemoglobin promoters from both nonlegumes, including the non-nodulating species, must contain conserved cisacting DNA signals that are responsible for nodule-specific expression in legumes. We have identified sequence motifs postulated previously as the nodule-specific regulatory elements of the soybean leghemoglobin genes [Stougaard et al.(1987).
