The binding to the GT-motif (5\u2032-TGGTTT-3\u2032) is essential for induction of ADH1 by low oxygen, while binding to the second motif, MBS-2, is not essential for induction. We show that AtMYB2 is induced by hypoxia with kinetics compatible with a role in the regulation of ADH1. Like ADH1, AtMYB2 has root-limited expression. When driven by a constitutive promoter, AtMYB2 is able to transactivate ADH1 expression in transient assays in both Arabidopsis and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia protoplasts, and in particle bombardment of Pisum sativum leaves. Mutation of the GT-motif abolished binding of AtMYB2 and caused loss of activity of the ADH1 promoter in both transient assays and transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These results are consistent with AtMYB2 being a key regulatory factor in the induction of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6724576209084581942", "cites_id": ["6724576209084581942"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/149/2/479/6034311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NoiHD29-Ul0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 7, "2001": 14, "2002": 11, "2003": 16, "2004": 9, "2005": 17, "2006": 12, "2007": 8, "2008": 11, "2009": 12, "2010": 16, "2011": 16, "2012": 19, "2013": 14, "2014": 12, "2015": 12, "2016": 18, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
