A deletion allele of HvVRN2 was associated with rapid inflorescence initiation and early flowering, but only in lines with an active allele of PPD-H1. In these lines, the floral promoter FLOWERING LOCUS T (HvFT1) was expressed at high levels without vernalization, and this preceded induction of HvVRN1. Lines with the deletion allele of HvVRN2 and the inactive ppd-H1 allele did not undergo rapid inflorescence initiation and were late flowering. These data suggest that HvVRN2 counteracts PPD-H1 to prevent flowering prior to vernalization. An allele of HvVRN1 that is expressed at high basal levels (HvVRN1-1) was associated with rapid inflorescence initiation regardless of HvVRN2 or PPD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 274, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12929253463500835311", "cites_id": ["12929253463500835311"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/147/1/355/6107588", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:78n03oXvbbMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 6, "2009": 18, "2010": 22, "2011": 23, "2012": 25, "2013": 19, "2014": 26, "2015": 17, "2016": 20, "2017": 12, "2018": 15, "2019": 17, "2020": 18, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
