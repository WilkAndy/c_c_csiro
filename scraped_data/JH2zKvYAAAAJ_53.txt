Vernalization-induced flowering is an epigenetic phenomenon. In Arabidopsis, stable down-regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) by vernalization is associated with changes in histone modifications at FLC chromatin. In cereals, the vernalization response is mediated by stable induction of the floral promoter VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1), which initiates reproductive development at the shoot apex. We show that in barley (Hordeum vulgare), repression of HvVRN1 before vernalization is associated with high levels of histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at HvVRN1 chromatin. Vernalization caused increased levels of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 259, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7542045136336922418", "cites_id": ["7542045136336922418"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0903566106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MidTjxe6qmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 9, "2011": 18, "2012": 27, "2013": 25, "2014": 28, "2015": 23, "2016": 14, "2017": 18, "2018": 22, "2019": 15, "2020": 19, "2021": 14, "2022": 20, "2023": 2}}
