Genetic and molecular analyses in recent years have started to illuminate how products of these multiple genes interact to initiate seed development. Imprinting or differential expression of paternal and maternal genes seems to be involved in controlling seed development, presumably by controlling gene expression in developing endosperm. Epigenetic processes such as chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation affect imprinting of key seed-specific genes; however, the identity of many of these genes remains unknown. The discovery of FIS genes has illuminated control of autonomous endosperm development, a component of apomixis, which is an important developmental and agronomic trait. FIS genes are targets of imprinting, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 253, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2443735265216374168", "cites_id": ["2443735265216374168"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.677", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mCVRuEbk6SEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 13, "2003": 21, "2004": 10, "2005": 19, "2006": 15, "2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 10, "2010": 12, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 11, "2014": 9, "2015": 13, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 14, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
