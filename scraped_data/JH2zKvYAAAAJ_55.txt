Vernalization, like other polycomb-mediated repression events [4], occurs in two stages; FLC repression is established at low temperatures, then maintained during subsequent growth at 22\u00b0C [5, 6]. Low temperatures induce VIN3 activity, which is required for changes in histone modifications and the associated FLC repression [3]. Plant polycomb proteins FIE, VRN2, CLF, and SWN, together with VIN3, form a complex that adds histone H3 lysine 27 methylation at FLC in vernalized plants [2, 3, 7]. VRN1 and LHP1 are required for maintenance of FLC repression [2, 3, 6, 8]. Tissue must be undergoing cell division during low-temperature treatments for acceleration of flowering to occur [9, 10]. We show that low-temperature treatments repress FLC in cells that are not mitotically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 249, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15312447248238339540", "cites_id": ["15312447248238339540"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207020878", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1GUnuaS9gNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 17, "2009": 31, "2010": 16, "2011": 17, "2012": 17, "2013": 14, "2014": 18, "2015": 21, "2016": 15, "2017": 20, "2018": 13, "2019": 8, "2020": 15, "2021": 11, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
