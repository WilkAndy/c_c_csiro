The three-dimensional structure of these Hbs is a 2-on-2 arrangement of \u03b1-helices, distinct from the 3-on-3 arrangement of the standard globin fold [Pesce, A., Couture, M., Dewilde, S., Guertin, M., Yamauchi, K., Ascenzi, P., Moens, L. & Bolognesi, M. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 2424\u20132434]. GLB3-like genes are not found in animals or yeast, but our analysis reveals that they are present in a wide range of Angiosperms and a Bryophyte. Although cyanobacteria and Chlamydomonas have 2-on-2 Hbs (GLBN), GLB3 is more likely related to GLBO-type 2-on-2 Hbs from bacteria. Consequently, GLB3 is unlikely to have arisen from a horizontal transfer between the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Arabidopsis thaliana GLB3 protein exhibits unusual concentration-independent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 249, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16141253456058500793", "cites_id": ["16141253456058500793"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.191349198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ucbpjX9AAeAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 11, "2003": 14, "2004": 9, "2005": 21, "2006": 12, "2007": 17, "2008": 15, "2009": 16, "2010": 12, "2011": 14, "2012": 10, "2013": 20, "2014": 19, "2015": 6, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
