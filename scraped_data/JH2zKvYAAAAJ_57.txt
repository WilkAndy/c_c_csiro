We isolated five FLC\u2010related sequences from Brassica napus (BnFLC1\u20135). Expression of each of the five sequences in Arabidopsis delayed flowering significantly, with the delay in flowering time ranging from 3\u2003weeks to more than 7\u2003months, relative to the flowering time of 3\u2003weeks in untransformed Ler. In the reciprocal experiment, expression of Arabidopsis FLC (AtFLC) in an early flowering B. napus cultivar delayed flowering by 2\u20136\u2003weeks, confirming the requirement of this gene for floral repression. In B. napus, we show that late flowering and responsiveness to vernalization correlate with the level of BnFLC mRNA expression. The different BnFLC genes show differential expression in leaves, stems and shoot tips, but expression is not detectable in roots. Vernalization dramatically reduces the level of BnFLC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 246, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13531525644305437522", "cites_id": ["13531525644305437522"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2001.01182.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UhPqYeGiybsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 8, "2004": 11, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 14, "2008": 9, "2009": 8, "2010": 8, "2011": 14, "2012": 14, "2013": 17, "2014": 13, "2015": 11, "2016": 14, "2017": 9, "2018": 21, "2019": 16, "2020": 15, "2021": 15, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
