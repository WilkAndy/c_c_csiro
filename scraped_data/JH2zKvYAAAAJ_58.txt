Arabidopsis encodes four DNA demethylases, DEMETER (DME), REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), DEMETER-LIKE 2 (DML2), and DML3. While DME is involved in maternal specific gene expression during seed development, the biological function of the remaining DNA demethylases remains unclear.We show that ROS1, DML2, and DML3 play a role in fungal disease resistance in Arabidopsis. A triple DNA demethylase mutant, rdd (ros1 dml2 dml3), shows increased susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. We identify 348 genes differentially expressed in rdd relative to wild type, and a significant proportion of these genes are downregulated in rdd and have functions in stress response, suggesting that DNA demethylases maintain or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 237, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17839715369086618191", "cites_id": ["17839715369086618191"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-014-0458-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Twp8_Jtmk_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 12, "2016": 19, "2017": 34, "2018": 25, "2019": 29, "2020": 43, "2021": 32, "2022": 37, "2023": 5}}
