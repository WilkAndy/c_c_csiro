We show by full-scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry that the transformed cells produceent-kaurenoic acid, and demonstrate that the single enzyme GA3 (ent-kaurene oxidase) catalyzes the three steps of gibberellin biosynthesis from ent-kaurene toent-kaurenoic acid."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 236, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7494712583781623751", "cites_id": ["7494712583781623751"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/119/2/507/6098663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xyf04WKRAmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 11, "2002": 8, "2003": 10, "2004": 3, "2005": 8, "2006": 23, "2007": 5, "2008": 12, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 17, "2012": 14, "2013": 9, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 15, "2018": 9, "2019": 14, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 7}}
