We report the cloning of the IKU1 (At2g35230) gene. iku1 mutants cause reduced endosperm growth and the production of small seeds. IKU1 encodes a protein containing a VQ motif, which is a motif specific to plants. IKU1 is expressed in the early endosperm and its progenitor, the central cell. Restoration of IKU1 function in the endosperm is sufficient to rescue seed size. A genomic construct carrying mutations in the VQ motif failed to complement the iku1 mutation, suggesting an essential role for the VQ motif. IKU1 interacts with MINI3 in the yeast two\u2010hybrid system, consistent with an IKU1 function in the IKU\u2010MINI pathway. Our data support the proposition that endosperm development is an important determinant of seed size."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 234, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13335001411021729247", "cites_id": ["13335001411021729247"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04271.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:321IpyFxD7kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 12, "2013": 21, "2014": 18, "2015": 17, "2016": 20, "2017": 13, "2018": 15, "2019": 24, "2020": 20, "2021": 26, "2022": 28, "2023": 13}}
