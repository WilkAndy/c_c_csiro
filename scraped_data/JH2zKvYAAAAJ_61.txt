Structural similarities amongst these and animal haemoglobins at the protein and gene level suggested a common evolutionary origin1'5\u20138. This suggests that haemoglobin genes, inherited from an ancestor common to plants and animals, might be present in all plants. We report here the isolation of a haemoglobin gene from Trema tomentosa, a non-nodulating relative of Parasponia(Ulmaceae)9. The gene has three introns located at positions identical to those in the haemoglobin genes of nodulating plant species, strengthening the case for a common origin of all plant haemoglobin genes. The data argue strongly against horizontal haemoglobin gene transfer from animals to plants. The Trema gene has a tissue-specific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3633797202072433657", "cites_id": ["3633797202072433657"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/331178a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-fNVd03XbTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 9, "1989": 12, "1990": 10, "1991": 12, "1992": 8, "1993": 6, "1994": 8, "1995": 7, "1996": 9, "1997": 17, "1998": 10, "1999": 4, "2000": 9, "2001": 7, "2002": 3, "2003": 9, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
