An R2R3 MYB, GhMYB25\u2010like, identified from its reduced expression in a fibreless mutant of cotton (Xu142 fl), is here shown to play a key role in the very early stages of fibre cell differentiation. A GhMYB25\u2010like promoter\u2013GUS construct was expressed predominantly in the epidermal layers of cotton ovules before anthesis (\u22123\u2003days post\u2010anthesis, dpa), increasing in expression in 0\u2010dpa ovules, primarily in those epidermal cells expanding into fibres, and then in elongating fibres at +3\u2003dpa, declining thereafter. This was consistent with GhMYB25\u2010like transcript abundance during fibre development. RNA interference suppression of GhMYB25\u2010like resulted in cotton plants with fibreless seeds, but normal trichomes elsewhere, phenocopying the Xu142 fl mutant.
