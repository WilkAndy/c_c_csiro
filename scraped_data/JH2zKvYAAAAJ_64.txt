It is expressed in cotyledons, stems of seedlings, roots, young leaves, and in some cells in the nodules that are associated with the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium symbiont. This contrasts with the expression of the leghemoglobins, which are active only in the infected cells of the nodules. The deduced protein sequence of the new gene shows only 58% similarity to one of the soybean leghemoglobins, but 85-87% similarity to hemoglobins from the nonlegumes Parasponia, Casuarina, and barley. The pattern of expression and the gene sequence indicate that this new gene is a nonsymbiotic legume hemoglobin. The finding of this gene in legumes and similar genes in other species strengthens our previous suggestion that genomes of all plants contain hemoglobin genes. The specialized leghemoglobin gene family may have arisen from a preexisting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14758209855664430274", "cites_id": ["14758209855664430274"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.93.12.5682", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:whyM36uxz8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 14, "1998": 18, "1999": 13, "2000": 12, "2001": 10, "2002": 10, "2003": 15, "2004": 9, "2005": 11, "2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
