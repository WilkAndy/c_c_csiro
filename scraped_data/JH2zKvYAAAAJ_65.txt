No CAT enzyme activity could be detected in transgenic tobacco plants unless upstream promoter elements from the octopine synthase gene or the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were supplied in addition to the maize promoter region. CAT enzyme activity and transcription of the chimaeric gene were then readily detected after anaerobic induction. The first 247 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of the maize Adh\u20101 gene were sufficient to impose anaerobic regulation on the hybrid gene and S1 nuclease mapping confirmed mRNA initiation is from the normal maize Adh\u20101 transcription start point."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 224, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2210691570059470477", "cites_id": ["2210691570059470477"], "pub_url": "https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1460-2075.1987.tb04711.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jWZYLUX0rR4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 16, "1988": 21, "1989": 27, "1990": 14, "1991": 21, "1992": 11, "1993": 11, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 4, "1997": 7, "1998": 5, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 11, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
