A major component of waterlogging stress is the lack of oxygen available to submerged tissues. While changes in expressed protein, gene transcription and metabolite levels have been studied in response to low oxygen stress, little research has been done on molecular responses to waterlogging in cotton. We assessed cotton growth responses to waterlogging and assayed global gene transcription responses in root and leaf cotton tissues of partially submerged plants. Waterlogging caused significant reductions in stem elongation, shoot mass, root mass and leaf number, and altered the expression of 1,012 genes (4% of genes assayed) in root tissue as early as 4\u2009h after flooding. Many of these genes were associated with cell wall modification and growth pathways, glycolysis, fermentation, mitochondrial electron transport and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 222, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=534414451151621738", "cites_id": ["534414451151621738"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/51/1/21/1860196", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ak66oxyfagcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 5, "2011": 10, "2012": 9, "2013": 20, "2014": 26, "2015": 28, "2016": 17, "2017": 16, "2018": 21, "2019": 11, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 19, "2023": 10}}
