To identify genes that might regulate lint fibre initiation, expression profiles of 0 days post-anthesis (dpa) whole ovules from six reduced fibre or fibreless mutants were compared with wild-type linted cotton using cDNA microarrays. Numerous clones were differentially expressed, but when only those genes that are normally expressed in the ovule outer integument (where fibres develop) were considered, just 13 different cDNA clones were down-regulated in some or all of the mutants. These included: a Myb transcription factor (GhMyb25) similar to the Antirrhinum Myb AmMIXTA, a putative homeodomain protein (related to Arabidopsis ATML1), a cyclin D gene, some previously identified fibre-expressed structural and metabolic genes, such as lipid transfer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12460002059139984259", "cites_id": ["12460002059139984259"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/47/1/107/1867579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g6usW9vR6qwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 20, "2008": 27, "2009": 12, "2010": 15, "2011": 12, "2012": 16, "2013": 18, "2014": 15, "2015": 19, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
