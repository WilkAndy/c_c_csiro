Previous genetic and transgenic data have suggested that FLC acts by repressing expression of the floral integrator genes SOC1 and FT. We have taken an in vivo approach to determine whether the FLC protein interacts directly with potential DNA targets. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have shown that FLC binds to a region of the first intron of FT that contains a putative CArG box, and have confirmed that FLC binds to a CArG box in the promoter of the SOC1 gene. MADS box proteins are thought to bind their DNA targets as dimers or higher\u2010order multimers. We have shown that FLC is a component of a multimeric protein complex in vivo and that more than one FLC polypeptides can be present in the complex."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 579, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9724619494442018486", "cites_id": ["9724619494442018486"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02686.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tiYOLujJ9IYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 6, "2007": 17, "2008": 22, "2009": 27, "2010": 25, "2011": 34, "2012": 33, "2013": 51, "2014": 45, "2015": 42, "2016": 37, "2017": 29, "2018": 38, "2019": 38, "2020": 40, "2021": 35, "2022": 42, "2023": 15}}
