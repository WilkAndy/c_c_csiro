The coding regions are 82% conserved at the nucleotide level and 87% conserved at the amino acid level. Each gene has nine introns in identical positions but their nucleotide sequences and lengths differ.              Adh2              encodes a single mRNA and has a possible polyadenylation signal, AATAAT, fifteen bases upstream from the polyadenylation site. The              Adh2              gene together with the              Adh1              gene is induced by anaerobic conditions and under these conditions produces an increased level of mRNA. The 5\u2032 untranslated regions of the transcripts of              Adh1              (100 bp) and              Adh2              (126 bp) have diverged in sequence except for a conserved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 215, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3370194649702632845", "cites_id": ["3370194649702632845"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/13/3/727/2381642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jY1yhy1WxS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 7, "1986": 22, "1987": 16, "1988": 22, "1989": 12, "1990": 12, "1991": 15, "1992": 9, "1993": 13, "1994": 16, "1995": 7, "1996": 9, "1997": 8, "1998": 7, "1999": 7, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
