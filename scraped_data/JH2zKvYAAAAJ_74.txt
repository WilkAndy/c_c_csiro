We have isolated the AMP1 gene by map-based cloning. The AMP1 cDNA encodes a 706;\u2013amino acid polypeptide with significant similarity to glutamate carboxypeptidases. The AMP1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues examined, with higher expression in roots, stems, inflorescences, and siliques. Microarray analysis identified four mRNA species with altered expression in two alleles of amp1, including upregulation of CYP78A5, which has been shown to mark the shoot apical meristem boundary. The similarity of the AMP1 protein to glutamate carboxypeptidases, and in particular to N-acetyl \u03b1-linked acidic dipeptidases, suggests that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14164002964439466436", "cites_id": ["14164002964439466436"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/13/9/2115/6009596", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xIH-7KalkMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 13, "2003": 12, "2004": 13, "2005": 19, "2006": 13, "2007": 18, "2008": 6, "2009": 10, "2010": 14, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 13, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
