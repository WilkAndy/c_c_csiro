Hybrid vigor was evident as early as mature seeds and in seedlings 3 d after sowing (DAS). At 3 DAS, genes encoding chloroplast-located proteins were significantly overrepresented (187) among the 724 genes that have greater than midparent values of expression in the hybrid. Many of these genes are involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis was constant per unit leaf area in parents and hybrids. Larger cell sizes in the hybrids were associated with more chloroplasts per cell, more total chlorophyll, and more photosynthesis. The increased transcription of the chloroplast-targeted genes was restricted to the 3\u20137 DAS period. At 10 DAS, only 118 genes had expression levels different from the expected midparent value in the hybrid, and only 12 of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11099854811118613162", "cites_id": ["11099854811118613162"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1204464109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qrIiIySbCpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 17, "2015": 18, "2016": 23, "2017": 16, "2018": 19, "2019": 19, "2020": 17, "2021": 24, "2022": 16, "2023": 12}}
