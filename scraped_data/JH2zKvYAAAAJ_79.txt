Three SVP-like genes are expressed in vegetative tissues of barley: Barley MADS1 (BM1), BM10, and Vegetative to Reproductive Transition gene 2. These genes are induced by cold but are repressed during floral development. Ectopic expression of BM1 inhibited spike development and caused floral reversion in barley, with florets at the base of the spike replaced by tillers. Head emergence was delayed in plants that ectopically express BM1, primarily by delayed development after the floral transition, but expression levels of the barley VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) were not affected. Ectopic expression of BM10 inhibited spike development and caused partial floral reversion, where florets at the base of the spike were replaced by inflorescence-like structures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3729865335080306467", "cites_id": ["3729865335080306467"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/143/1/225/6106646", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I0eBtcIkwzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 16, "2010": 11, "2011": 6, "2012": 18, "2013": 16, "2014": 17, "2015": 13, "2016": 5, "2017": 9, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 15, "2021": 20, "2022": 11, "2023": 6}}
