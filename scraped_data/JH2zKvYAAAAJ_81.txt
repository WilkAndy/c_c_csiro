Gibberellin biosynthesis from geranylgeranyl diphosphate is catalysed by enzymes of the terpene cyclase, cytochrome P450 mono\u2010oxygenase and 2\u2010oxoglutarate\u2010dependent dioxygenase classes. We show that the N\u2010terminal pre\u2010sequences of the Arabidopsis thaliana terpene cyclases copalyl diphosphate synthase (AtCPS1) and ent\u2010kaurene synthase (AtKS1) direct GFP to chloroplasts in transient assays following microprojectile bombardment of tobacco leaves. The AtKS1\u2013GFP fusion is also imported by isolated pea chloroplasts. The N\u2010terminal portion of the cytochrome P450 protein ent\u2010kaurene oxidase (AtKO1) directs GFP to chloroplasts in tobacco leaf transient assays. Chloroplast import assays with 35S\u2010labelled AtKO1 protein show that it \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4757202189717605926", "cites_id": ["4757202189717605926"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.2001.01150.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Jg7U0i_6BEIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 9, "2005": 6, "2006": 13, "2007": 8, "2008": 17, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 10, "2014": 14, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 12, "2021": 5, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
