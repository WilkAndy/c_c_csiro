Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence. Type 1 spikelets (approximately 25%) were sterile due to a failure in accumulation of starch in pollen grains. Type 2 spikelets (approximately 55%) had viable pollen grains, but anthers failed to dehisce and/or synchronize with anthesis due to failure in septum degradation and stomium breakage, resulting in sterility. Type 3 spikelets (approximately 20%) had normal fertility. In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type. The Ds insertion responsible for the aid1 mutation was mapped within the coding region of the AID1 gene on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 177, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8569018750971345668", "cites_id": ["8569018750971345668"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/135/3/1514/6112144", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BPtORSdF63YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 19, "2008": 7, "2009": 13, "2010": 10, "2011": 16, "2012": 9, "2013": 12, "2014": 10, "2015": 14, "2016": 11, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
