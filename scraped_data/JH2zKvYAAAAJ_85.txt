They were derived from mRNA extracted from anaerobically treated roots of maize seedlings. Identification was initially made on the basis of molecular weight and electrophoretic properties of the in vitro polypeptide obtained in hybridization-release-translation experiments. The identification was confirmed by antibody precipitation and by the use of maize stocks having different genetic constitutions at the Adh1 locus. The sequence of the longest cDNA segment, \u2248900 base pairs, was determined and appears to code for 168 COOH-terminal amino acids and to have a 3\u2032 nontranslated region of 364 base pairs. Reverse Southern hybridizations established that two different Adh1-S stocks produce a mRNA of 1,650 nucleotides, whereas an additional \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 177, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11880948560775969452", "cites_id": ["11880948560775969452"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.79.9.2981", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rHq9n8Sb4aQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 3, "1983": 10, "1984": 19, "1985": 11, "1986": 13, "1987": 12, "1988": 6, "1989": 9, "1990": 10, "1991": 11, "1992": 4, "1993": 6, "1994": 12, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 5, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 3}}
