A microarray containing 3500 cDNA clones was first screened to enrich for genes affected by wounding in the immediate vicinity of the wound (4 h post wounding). 359 non-redundant putative wound responsive genes were then spotted on a smaller wound-response array for detailed analysis of spatial expression (local, adjacent and systemic), timing of expression (0.5, 4, 8, 17 h), and effect of hormone treatments (methyl jasmonate, ethylene and abscisic acid). Our results show that genes that respond early at the site of the wound also respond throughout the plant, with similar kinetics. Early-induced genes which respond systemically encode predominantly signal transduction and regulatory factors (36%), and the expression of many of them is also controlled by methyl jasmonate (about 35% of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7801982999576157079", "cites_id": ["7801982999576157079"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11103-004-0112-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l5tfkTM2RmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 10, "2006": 15, "2007": 13, "2008": 13, "2009": 8, "2010": 6, "2011": 10, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 19, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 5, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
