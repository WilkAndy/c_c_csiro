We previously defined the  MS5  locus by characterizing an EMS\u2010induced allele,  ms5\u20131  . We identified a new allele of  MS5  (  ms5\u20132  ) that was T\u2010DNA\u2010generated and used the T\u2010DNA tag to clone the gene. Sequencing of mutant and wild\u2010type alleles together with complementation of the  ms5\u20131  mutant phenotype with a wild\u2010type genomic clone confirmed the identity of the gene. Differences between the phenotypes of the two mutant alleles could be attributed to differences in mutant gene structure. The semi\u2010dominant and dominant negative phenotypes of the  ms5\u20132  mutant probably result from production of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 171, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5264268196223041498", "cites_id": ["5264268196223041498"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1998.00216.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2r9CfghwDkkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 6, "2000": 4, "2001": 9, "2002": 3, "2003": 10, "2004": 8, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 13, "2009": 3, "2010": 9, "2011": 7, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 8, "2015": 11, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
