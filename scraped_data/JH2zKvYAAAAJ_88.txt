Plants respond to waterlogging with a complex set of physiological responses regulated at the transcriptional, cellular, and tissue levels. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) NAC domain-containing gene ANAC102 was shown to be induced under 0.1% oxygen within 30 min in both roots and shoots as well as in 0.1% oxygen-treated germinating seeds. Overexpression of ANAC102 altered the expression of a number of genes, including many previously identified as being low-oxygen responsive. Decreasing ANAC102 expression had no effect on global gene transcription in plants but did alter expression patterns in low-oxygen-stressed seeds. Increasing or decreasing the expression of ANAC102 did not affect adult plant survival of low-oxygen stress. Decreased ANAC102 expression significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 166, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4503114224236136295", "cites_id": ["4503114224236136295"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/149/4/1724/6107752", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z4eaRodGfj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 5, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 13, "2015": 13, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 13, "2021": 15, "2022": 10, "2023": 10}}
