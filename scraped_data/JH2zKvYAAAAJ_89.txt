The recent isolation of one of the key genes involved in vernalization, FLOWERING LOCUS C, has now provided an insight into the molecular mechanism involved, including the role of DNA methylation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13603038709572628311", "cites_id": ["13603038709572628311"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526600001060", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V-_2ZaKzx7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 8, "2002": 11, "2003": 12, "2004": 18, "2005": 5, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 9, "2009": 8, "2010": 9, "2011": 14, "2012": 11, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
