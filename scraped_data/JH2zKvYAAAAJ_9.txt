These genes confer female gametophytic  phenotypes. FIS2 encodes a protein with a  C2H2 zinc-finger motif and three putative  nuclear localization signals, indicating that it is likely to be a  transcription factor. FIS1 encodes a protein with  homology to the Drosophila Polycomb group gene  Enhancer-of-zeste and is identical to the recently  described Arabidopsis gene MEDEA. FIS1 is  a protein with a number of putative functional domains, including the  SET domain present in Enhancer-of-zeste-related proteins. Comparison of  the position of the lesions in the fis1 and  medea mutant alleles indicates that fis1  is a null allele producing a truncated polypeptide lacking all the  protein domains whereas the deduced protein from medea  lacks only the SET \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 543, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10208547524653127011", "cites_id": ["10208547524653127011"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.96.1.296", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y5Wk7-ILrI0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 12, "2000": 22, "2001": 31, "2002": 36, "2003": 35, "2004": 23, "2005": 23, "2006": 29, "2007": 36, "2008": 22, "2009": 29, "2010": 27, "2011": 20, "2012": 27, "2013": 26, "2014": 13, "2015": 19, "2016": 21, "2017": 20, "2018": 19, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
