Haemoglobin occurs not only in the roots of those plants that are capable of nodulation but also in the roots of species that are not known to nodulate. We suggest that a haemoglobin gene may be a component of the genome of all plants. The gene structure and sequence in two unrelated families of plants suggests that the plant haemoglobins have had a single origin and that this origin relates to the haemoglobin gene of the animal kingdom. At present we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a horizontal transfer of the gene from the animal kingdom to a progenitor of the dicotyledonous angiosperms but we favour a single origin of the gene from a progenitor organism to both the plant and animal kingdoms. We speculate about the possible functions of haemoglobin in plant roots and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7726470496842533715", "cites_id": ["7726470496842533715"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1988.tb01360.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U8vV8_rvOWsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 6, "1991": 6, "1992": 14, "1993": 5, "1994": 10, "1995": 8, "1996": 5, "1997": 12, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 8, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
