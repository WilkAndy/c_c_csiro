ELF1 is expressed in the developing eucalypt floral organs in a pattern similar to LEAFY while ELF2 appears to be a pseudo gene. ELF1 is expressed strongly in the early floral primordium and then successively in the primordia of sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. It is also expressed in the leaf primordia and young leaves and adult and juvenile trees.The ELF1 promoter coupled to a GUS reporter gene directs expression in transgenic Arabidopsis in a temporal and tissue-specific pattern similar to an equivalent Arabidopsis LEAFY promoter construct. Strong expression is seen in young flower buds and then later in sepals and petals. No expression was seen in rosette leaves or roots of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=699818783164010182", "cites_id": ["699818783164010182"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006056014079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xg6juXlBtgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 9, "2002": 10, "2003": 10, "2004": 13, "2005": 11, "2006": 9, "2007": 13, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 10, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
