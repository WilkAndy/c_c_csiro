A large proportion of the genome was expressed during both fiber elongation and subsequent secondary cell wall thickening. There was a major shift in abundance of transcripts for gene regulation, cell organization and metabolism between fiber elongation and fiber thickening that was fundamentally similar in both species. Each stage had its own distinctive features represented by specific metabolic and regulatory genes, a number of which have been noted previously. Many of the genes expressed in the fibers were of a similar type and developmental expression to those seen in other fiber-producing plants, indicating a conservation of mechanisms of cell elongation and wall thickening across diverse plant genera \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6310106660866435801", "cites_id": ["6310106660866435801"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-abstract/50/7/1364/1890195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2SrFX5MAklcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 10, "2011": 9, "2012": 14, "2013": 21, "2014": 18, "2015": 14, "2016": 19, "2017": 4, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
