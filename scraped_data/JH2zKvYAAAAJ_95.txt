Class 1 and 2 Hbs are full\u2010length globins with the classical eight helix Mb\u2010like fold, whereas Class 3 plant Hbs resemble the truncated globins found in bacteria. With the exception of the specialized leghemoglobins, the physiological functions of these plant hemoglobins remain unknown. We have reviewed and, in some cases, measured new oxygen binding properties of a large number of Class 1 and 2 plant nonsymbiotic Hbs and leghemoglobins. We found that sequence classification correlates with distinct extents of hexacoordination with the distal histidine and markedly different overall oxygen affinities and association and dissociation rate constants. These results suggest strong selective pressure for the evolution of distinct physiological functions. The leghemoglobins evolved from the Class 2 globins and show no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC", "num_citations": 149, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2394984799203156128", "cites_id": ["2394984799203156128"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bip.21256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oOD2VvyxPCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 11, "2011": 19, "2012": 6, "2013": 18, "2014": 19, "2015": 8, "2016": 13, "2017": 9, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 14, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
