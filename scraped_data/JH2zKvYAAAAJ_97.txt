The Parasponia gene has homology to haemoglobin genes in another distantly-related nodulating plant, Casuarina. It also hybridizes at high stringency to sequences in a related, but non-nodulating genus, Trema. We conclude that the globin gene family may be widespread in modern plants, that plant haemoglobins may have a cryptic function in non-symbiotic tissue and that plant haemoglobins have evolved by vertical descent, probably from an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9660300114362970166", "cites_id": ["9660300114362970166"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/324166a0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NjBFhMVHEIYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 8, "1988": 11, "1989": 4, "1990": 6, "1991": 12, "1992": 12, "1993": 6, "1994": 8, "1995": 6, "1996": 10, "1997": 7, "1998": 7, "1999": 1, "2000": 7, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
