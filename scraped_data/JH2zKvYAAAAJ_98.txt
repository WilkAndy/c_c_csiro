Root extracts of 645 primary regenerant plants were tested, and one stable mutant of Adh1 was detected. The mutant gene (Adh1-Usv) produces a functional enzyme with a slower electrophoretic mobility than that of the progenitor Adh1-S allele, and is stably transmitted to progeny. The mutant was not present among four other plants derived from the same immature embryo, and therefore arose as a consequence of the culture procedure. The gene of Adh1-Usv was cloned and sequenced. A single base change in exon 6 was the only alteration found in the gene sequence. This would translate in the polypeptide sequence to a valine residue substituting for a glutamic acid residue, resulting in the loss of a negative charge and the production of a protein with slower electrophoretic mobility."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16501057667846644454", "cites_id": ["16501057667846644454"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00331642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5iI8xoWI_-QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 4, "1987": 6, "1988": 9, "1989": 7, "1990": 18, "1991": 7, "1992": 6, "1993": 4, "1994": 6, "1995": 3, "1996": 8, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
