These occurred in two phases: the perception of prolonged cold, which occurred gradually at low temperatures, and the acceleration of reproductive development, which occurred after vernalization. Expression of the VERNALIZATION1 gene (HvVRN1) increased gradually in germinating seedlings during vernalization, both at the shoot apex and in the developing leaves. This occurred in darkness, independently of VERNALIZATION2 (HvVRN2), consistent with the hypothesis that expression of HvVRN1 is induced by prolonged cold independently of daylength flowering-response pathways. After vernalization, expression of HvVRN1 was maintained in the shoot apex and leaves. This was associated with accelerated inflorescence initiation and with down-regulation of HvVRN2 in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "JH2zKvYAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5540716300061813022", "cites_id": ["5540716300061813022"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/60/7/2169/684156", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Hqlmch6U5EwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 11, "2013": 16, "2014": 16, "2015": 15, "2016": 12, "2017": 14, "2018": 11, "2019": 12, "2020": 3, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
