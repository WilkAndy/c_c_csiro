The concept assumes an \u2018original state\u2019 exists and that a return to that state might be possible, if it could be determined and there was sufficient control of human interference. The concept has been important in both marine conservation planning and fisheries management. However, long periods of exploitation, observed and projected climate change, and the disappearance of some environments, suggest that a return to an original state is unlikely to be achievable in many systems. In addition, protection based on static marine protected areas is unlikely to meet common conservation objectives, as species and habitats are moving and species assemblages shuffling with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14324137138863928638", "cites_id": ["14324137138863928638"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2011.00459.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PvX209WOycYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 11, "2015": 6, "2016": 9, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
