What is expected: While the mean climate of the Pacific is expected to change, it is unclear how the amplitude or frequency of ENSO will change (if at all) over the next 100 years.  What we are doing about it: Investing in Pacific region climate change programs, high quality data collection and monitoring, improving pre-instrumental ENSO reconstructions, process studies to understand mechanisms of variability, and enhancing modelling capabilities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17523641132954595224", "cites_id": ["17523641132954595224"], "pub_url": "https://research.usq.edu.au/item/q6yqq/el-nino-southern-oscillation", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mK8uJcR6MPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 6}}
