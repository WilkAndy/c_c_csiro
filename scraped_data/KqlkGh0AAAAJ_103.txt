NMFS received a draft status review document from Scripps, in April 1090. In order to obtain an independent peer-revit.: w, NMFS requested three non-federal scientists to review and report on the scientific merits of this status review. By August 1999, NMFS received these anonymous reviews. Abalone experts from the California Department of Fish and Game and the National Park Service. and NMFS scientists, also reviewed the document. Subsequently, the authors incorporated these comments into this status review, and submitted the revised final status rcvicw document to NMFS on March 20, 2000.We hope that the distribution of this report. will facilitate further discussion and research on the status of white abalone, but the findings of this report should not be construed. as NMFS\u2019s determination as to whether white abalone should be listed as a threatened or endangered species under the ESA.
