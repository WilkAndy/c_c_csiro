However, an overlooked stressor is the change in ocean circulation in response to climate change. Strong changes in the intensity and position of the western boundary currents have already been observed, and the consequences of such changes for ecosystems are beginning to emerge. In this study, we address climatically induced changes in ocean circulation on a global scale but relevant to propagule dispersal for species inhabiting global shelf ecosystems, using a high\u2010resolution global ocean model run under the IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario. The \u00bc degree model resolution allows improved regional realism of the ocean circulation beyond that of available CMIP5\u2010class models. We use a Lagrangian approach forced by modelled ocean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15215921421576571791", "cites_id": ["15215921421576571791"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13586", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jwtUX-rPKdMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 17, "2023": 3}}
