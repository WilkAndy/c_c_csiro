This can be achieved using species distribution models that include physical environmental predictors. In the present study, species distribution models that describe the seasonal habitats of two pelagic fish (dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus and yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi), are developed using 19 yr of presence\u2010only data from a recreational angler\u2010based catch\u2010and\u2010release fishing programme. A Poisson point process model within a generalized additive modelling framework was used to determine the species distributions off the east coast of Australia as a function of several oceanographic covariates. This modelling framework uses presence\u2010only data to determine the intensity of fish (fish km\u22122 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9923687879234986313", "cites_id": ["9923687879234986313"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fog.12122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SaGmV4wFuIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 14, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
