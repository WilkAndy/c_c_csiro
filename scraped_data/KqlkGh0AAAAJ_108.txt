Three themes were investigated that differentiate the open ocean (areas beyond national jurisdiction and deep area within exclusive economic zones) from other realms and must be considered when developing planning and management options: ecosystem interactions, especially between benthic and pelagic systems; potential effects of human activities in open oceans on ecological linkages; and policy context and options. A number of key ecological factors differentiate open oceans from coastal systems for planners and managers: (1) many species are widely distributed and, especially for those at higher trophic levels, wide ranging; (2) the sizes and boundaries of biogeographical domains (patterns of co-occurrence of species, habitats and ecosystem processes) vary significantly by depth; (3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8463164224161809901", "cites_id": ["8463164224161809901"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X13002832", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7YX1qAUzc3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
