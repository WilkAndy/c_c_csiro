Limpet body size increased with increasing tidal height. This increase in size with tidal height was correlated with exposure to wave splash and migratory behavior. In areas of high and intermediate wave splash, there was a significant positive correlation between increased limpet size and tidal height, while in sheltered conditions there was no significant gradient in body size. Transplant experiments suggested that the size gradient could be maintained by the upward migration of large limpets and downward migration of small limpets. In the area with little size gradient, there was no significant directional migration of transplanted limpets. Limpets initially exhibited a fixed migratory response when displaced both within an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14184651688486158867", "cites_id": ["14184651688486158867"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002209819500009G", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E8Lcoo4B2sQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 8, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
