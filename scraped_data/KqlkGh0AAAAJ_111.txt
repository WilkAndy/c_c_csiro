We assessed the ability of leading modes of climate variability [Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), Pacific\u2010North American Pattern (PNA), North Pacific Index (NPI), El Ni\u00f1o\u2010Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] to explain decadal\u2010scale (1965\u20132008) patterns of climatic and biological variability across two North Pacific ecosystems (Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea). Our response variables were the first principle component (PC1) of four regional climate parameters [sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), freshwater input, ice cover], and PCs 1\u20132 of 36 biological time series [production or abundance for populations of salmon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16363945925072227847", "cites_id": ["16363945925072227847"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12373", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:B46hcx5qGOMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 9, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
