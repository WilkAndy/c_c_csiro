The assessment was applied to 7 major industries in the temperate south-east region of Australia and involved a simple, transparent and repeatable methodology that was appropriate for a range of different aquaculture systems and taxa. Two key stages were involved: the development of comprehensive expertise-based literature reviews or \u2018species profiles\u2019 and a scoring assessment, with the latter providing a defined framework within which industries could be ranked (from high to low risk). In addition to informing the second stage of the risk assessment process, the species\u2019 profiles also highlighted important climate change drivers and key information uncertainties and knowledge gaps. There was good resolution among the scoring assessments, with only 2 industries \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17875777593467453163", "cites_id": ["17875777593467453163"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/aei/v3/n2/p163-175/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:676D5gKFE_gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 7}}
