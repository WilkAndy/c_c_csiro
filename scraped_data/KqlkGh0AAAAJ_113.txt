The upper layers of the oceans have absorbed >90% of the excess heat arising from human activities and, as a result, surface waters have warmed at an average rate of 0.15\u00b0C per decade over the past 40 years, with global ocean heat content currently at a record high. Many marine species have shifted their distributions in response to this ubiquitous warming, causing community reconfigurations and changes to entire ecosystems. In addition to gradual warming, the frequency and severity of short-term oceanic warming events, marine heatwaves (MHWs), has increased substantially, largely as a consequence of rising anthropogenic carbon emissions and ocean warming. The global annual number of MHW days has risen by 54% over the past century, with eight of the 10 most extreme MHWs ever \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:EBV337fEn3EC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11508790215553982686", "cites_id": ["11508790215553982686"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abj3593", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3iCWkLlvt58J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 31, "2023": 29}}
