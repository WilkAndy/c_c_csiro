MHW-induced coral bleaching events have been observed frequently in recent decades in the southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO), a region traditionally regarded to have resilience to global warming. In this study, we assess the contribution of El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to MHWs across the mostly understudied reefs in the SEIO. We find that in extended summer months, the MHWs at tropical and subtropical reefs (divided at ~20\u00b0S) are driven by opposite ENSO polarities: MHWs are more likely to occur at the tropical reefs during eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o, driven by enhanced solar radiation and weaker Australian Monsoon, some likely alleviated by positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, and at the subtropical reefs during central \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13059696103315306302", "cites_id": ["13059696103315306302"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02688-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PnepqGlcPbUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 14, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
