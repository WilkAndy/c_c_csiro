Analysis of over 14,000 tuna stomachs, using a modified classification tree approach, revealed for the first time the global expanse of pelagic predatory fish diet and global patterns of micronekton diversity. Ommastrephid squids were consistently one of the top prey groups by weight across all tuna species and in most ocean bodies. Interspecific differences in prey were apparent, with epipelagic scombrid and mesopelagic paralepidid fishes globally important for yellowfin and bigeye tunas, respectively, while vertically-migrating euphausiid crustaceans were important for albacore tuna in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4741702012717923547", "cites_id": ["4741702012717923547"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064517300620", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:23zOotvozUEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
