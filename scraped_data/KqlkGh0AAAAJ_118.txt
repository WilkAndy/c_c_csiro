While climate change has been a consideration for Australian fisheries and aquaculture management, emphasis in both research and adaptation effort has been at the production end of supply chains\u2014impacts further along the chain have been overlooked to date. A holistic biophysical and socio-economic system view of seafood industries, as represented by end-to-end supply chains, may lead to an additional set of options in the face of climate change, thus maximizing opportunities for improved fishery profitability, while also reducing the potential for maladaptation. In this paper, we explore Australian seafood industry stakeholder perspectives on potential options for adaptation along seafood supply chains based on future \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16754531390680382357", "cites_id": ["16754531390680382357"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-014-0670-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lbuiz4cNhOgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
