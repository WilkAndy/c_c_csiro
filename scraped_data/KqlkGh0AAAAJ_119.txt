Even so, the relative contribution of species detectability to the variation in measured range shift rates among species is poorly understood. How can true range shifts be discerned from sampling artefacts?Australia.We simulate range shifts for species which differ in their abundance for comparison to patterns derived from empirical range shift data from two regional\u2010scale (100s km) empirical studies. We demonstrate the use of spatial occupancy data in a distance\u2010to\u2010edge (DTE) model to assess changes in geographical range edges of fish species within a temperate reef fish community.Simulations identified how sampling design can produce relatively larger error in range shift estimates in less abundant species, patterns that correspond with those observed in real data.
