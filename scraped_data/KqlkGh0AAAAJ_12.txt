In this review, we consider how conceptual and practical issues associated with terrestrial SDMs apply to a range of marine organisms and highlight the challenges relevant to improving marine SDMs.Location\u2002 We include studies from both marine and terrestrial systems that encompass many geographic locations around the globe.Methods\u2002 We first performed a literature search and analysis of marine and terrestrial SDMs in ISI Web of Science to assess trends and applications. Using knowledge from terrestrial applications, we critically evaluate the application of SDMs in marine systems in the context of ecological factors (dispersal, species interactions, aggregation and ontogenetic shifts) and practical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 450, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7322390324863486563", "cites_id": ["7322390324863486563"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00636.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y8o-bDRbnmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 19, "2013": 36, "2014": 26, "2015": 49, "2016": 43, "2017": 42, "2018": 45, "2019": 33, "2020": 50, "2021": 43, "2022": 40, "2023": 12}}
