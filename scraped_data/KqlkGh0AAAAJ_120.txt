However, the success of such policies or management interventions depends on the effective integration of new scientific research into the decision-making process. Ineffective communication between scientists and environmental decision makers represents one of the key barriers limiting the integration of science into the decision-making process in many areas of natural resource management. This can be overcome by understanding the perceptions of end users, so as to identify knowledge gaps and develop improved and targeted strategies for communication and engagement. We assessed what one group of environmental decision makers, Australian marine protected area (MPA) managers, viewed as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10260966592132213053", "cites_id": ["10260966592132213053"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26269674", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PekwKMBGZo4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 10, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
