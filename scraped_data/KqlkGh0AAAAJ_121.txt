These species may have associations with particular water masses or habitats, but to best understand patterns in the ocean, these habitats must be identified. Previous efforts have produced static or seasonal climatologies, which still represent smearing over habitats. The Eastern Tuna and Billfish Longline Fishery (ETBF) targets a range of high trophic level species in oceanic waters off eastern Australia. In this study, dynamic ocean habitats in the region were identified for each month based on cluster analysis of five oceanographic variables averaged at a monthly time scale and a spatial scale of 0.5\u00b0 for the period 1995\u20132006. A total of seven persistent habitats were identified off eastern Australia with intra and interannual variation in size and location, indicating the importance of spatial and temporal variation in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9831433392379961298", "cites_id": ["9831433392379961298"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510002845", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0p-4yZREcIgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
