We tested bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for measurement of relative condition of southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) during conventional tagging at sea. We refined the equipment and method by measurement of 360 fish during conventional and acoustic tagging. Our results demonstrate that BIA is an accurate measure of condition for southern bluefin tuna in the same way it has been shown to be for metabolic condition and composition in other vertebrates including humans. Further, there is sufficient variation in BIA measures of the natural population to give meaningful measures of both metabolic condition and composition between groups at different times and developmental stages. Condition of tuna in this study may be related to the ocean environment just prior to measurement.
