In the marine realm, environmental variability can lead to the development of temporary periods of anomalous oceanographic conditions that can connect individuals to areas of habitat outside a population's usual range, or alternatively, restrict individuals from areas usually within their range, thus acting as ecological bridges or ecological barriers. These temporary features can result in novel or irregular trophic interactions and changes in population spatial dynamics, and, therefore, may have significant implications for management of marine ecosystems. Here, we provide evidence of ecological bridges and barriers in different ocean regions, drawing upon five case studies in which particular oceanographic conditions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1744279916472263300", "cites_id": ["1744279916472263300"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064516303290", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hGItqlftNBgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 15, "2020": 12, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
