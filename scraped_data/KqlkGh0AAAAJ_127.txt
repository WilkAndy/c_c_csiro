These alarming changes have prompted calls for new and improved conservation and management tools if the future sustainability of oceanic ecosystems is to be assured. Spatial management, although widely used in coastal and nearshore environments, is one strategy yet to be adequately considered for open ocean systems. Resistance to both investigation and implementation of this management approach stems predominantly from the perception that given the highly dynamic nature of the ocean, adequate protection of both its biological and physical components would require regulation of vast regions. To examine this assertion, a series of reserve networks were modelled using the reserve design tool Marxan for an oceanic region off eastern Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15740889361579845800", "cites_id": ["15740889361579845800"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF06214", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qCixvXnfctoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 8, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
