Climate change is expected to compound many pressing issues affecting fisheries management. Good governance of fisheries, which is critical to building their adaptive capacity and social-ecological resilience, is seen as ever more important in the context of climate change. A range of fisheries management approaches have been developed and, to varying degrees, applied. Each has been described in the literature as a promising way to manage marine resources. Through literature reviews and a survey of practitioners, this study explores how theoretical properties of selected major management approaches (i.e., ecosystem-based management, adaptive management, co-management, adaptive co-management, and active adaptive management) enable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2349496195870151873", "cites_id": ["2349496195870151873"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16302962", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wdT4i1cWmyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
