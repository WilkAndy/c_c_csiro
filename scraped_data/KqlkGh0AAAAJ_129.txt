Such impacts have already led to observed consequences for human health, safety and economic prosperity. Enhancing the adaptive capacity of Pacific Island communities is one way to reduce vulnerability and is underpinned by the extent to which people can access, understand and use new knowledge to inform their decision-making processes. However, effective engagement of Pacific Island communities in climate adaption remains variable and is an ongoing and significant challenge. Here, we use a qualitative research approach to identify the impediments to engaging Pacific Island communities in the adaptations needed to safeguard food security. The main barriers include cultural differences between western science and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=451564872090600134", "cites_id": ["451564872090600134"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096316000048", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xkIB0ttHRAYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
