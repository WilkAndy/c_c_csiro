Though the early life stages of these taxa are relatively well-studied, worldwide patterns in larval feeding dynamics and how such patterns relate to environmental conditions are poorly resolved. We present a synthesis of feeding success (i.e. feeding incidences) and diets of larval scombroids from around the world, and relate these results to water column and sea surface properties for the several regions in which larval feeding studies have been conducted. Feeding success of larval tunas was shown to be distinctly different among regions. In some locations (the Straits of Florida and the Mediterranean Sea), nearly no larvae had empty guts, whereas in other locations (the Gulf of California and off NW Australia) ~40\u201360% of larvae were empty. Diets were consistently \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7487908661203423619", "cites_id": ["7487908661203423619"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064514001477", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g9GZNUFl6mcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 9, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
