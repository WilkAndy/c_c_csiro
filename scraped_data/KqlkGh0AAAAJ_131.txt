After adjusting for regional variations in baseline \u03b415N values using a global ocean biogeochemistry model, generalized additive mixed models were employed to infer global\u2010scale oceanographic controls of trophic structure, using cosmopolitan tuna species as a model.For the three tuna \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16172424975145056998", "cites_id": ["16172424975145056998"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12763", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5jotaNT-b-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 6, "2020": 13, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 7}}
