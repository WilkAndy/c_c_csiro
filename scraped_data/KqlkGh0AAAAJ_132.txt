Both have been applied to major Australian Commonwealth fisheries and, with various modifications, adopted internationally. However, there has been no formal comparison between the two approaches and no validation against other data-rich assessment methods. Here, we conduct three comparisons: between PSA and SAFE, between PSA, SAFE and Fishery Status Reports (FSR), and between PSA, SAFE and data-rich quantitative stock assessments. PSA and SAFE use similar data. However, PSA typically downgrades quantitative information into an ordinal scale between 1 and 3, whereas SAFE uses the quantitative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:3NQIlFlcGxIC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6619465600716573693", "cites_id": ["6619465600716573693"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783616302272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_QuhdeQQ3VsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 10, "2020": 12, "2021": 15, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
