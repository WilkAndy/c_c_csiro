Without clearer understanding of at-sea distribution and mortality during this life-history stage, the threats to albatrosses cannot be managed appropriately. We investigated this early at-sea behaviour of shy albatrosses Thalassarche cauta, which breed only in Tasmania. We deployed 48 satellite transmitters on fledgling birds from each of the 3 Tasmanian populations over 4 separate seasons. We observed population differences in the at-sea distribution, with the northern Albatross Island population foraging exclusively in southern Australian shelf waters to the west of the breeding colony. Birds from the 2 populations in southern Tasmania (Mewstone and Pedra Branca) also favoured these areas; however, they showed greater tendency to traverse the high seas and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4994689642715836872", "cites_id": ["4994689642715836872"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v405/p271-285/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yHFmXcSzUEUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
