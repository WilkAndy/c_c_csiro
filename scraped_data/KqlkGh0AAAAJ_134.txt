We challenge current piecemeal bycatch management paradigms, which reduce the mortality of one taxon of conservation concern at the unintended expense of others. Bycatch mitigation measures may also reduce intraspecific genetic diversity. We drew examples of broadly prescribed \u2018best practice\u2019 methods to mitigate bycatch that result in unintended cross-taxa conflicts from pelagic longline, tuna purse seine, gillnet and trawl fisheries. We identified priority improvements in data quality and in understanding ecological effects of bycatch fishing mortality to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:RuPIJ_LgqDgC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9148397779921872226", "cites_id": ["9148397779921872226"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-019-09547-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YiU3gE-j9X4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 12, "2021": 10, "2022": 19, "2023": 6}}
