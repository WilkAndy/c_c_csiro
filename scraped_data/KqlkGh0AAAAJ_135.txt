These supply chains are increasingly exposed to the impacts of a changing climate, yet receive little attention relative to the study of the production phase. Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate-related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries \u2013 fisheries, agriculture and mining \u2013 that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices \u2013 evenness, resilience \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2680309652402576563", "cites_id": ["2680309652402576563"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378017301164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s5yBj21fMiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
