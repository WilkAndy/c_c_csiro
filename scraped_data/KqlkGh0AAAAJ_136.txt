It is also clear that the plans to optimise the benefits of fisheries and aquaculture for the region are likely to be affected by climate change The authors begin by summarising the recent contributions of oceanic, coastal and freshwater fisheries, and aquaculture, to the region and then explain the plans PICTs have to optimise these benefits and conclude by assessing the vulnerability of these plans to the main projected changes in production of fisheries resources and aquaculture due to climate change for 2035 and 2100 under a low (B1) and high (A2) emissions scenarios."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8890954682178406628", "cites_id": ["8890954682178406628"], "pub_url": "https://digitalarchive.worldfishcenter.org/handle/20.500.12348/1067", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5AhXWS0EY3sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
