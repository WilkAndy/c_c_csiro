Changes in temperature, environmental flows, ocean pH, sea level, and wind regimes are all contributing to modifications in productivity, distribution and phenology of marine species, affecting ecosystem processes and altering food webs (Brierley and Kingsford 2009, Brown et al. 2010). Alterations to species\u2019 rates of growth, survival, and reproduction, or responses to changes at other trophic levels, may have impacts on the catch and distribution of commercial fisheries (Perry et al. 2010)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6529893650606355703", "cites_id": ["6529893650606355703"], "pub_url": "https://www.fish.gov.au/Archived-Reports/2014/Documents/Pecl_et_al_2011_Fisheries_Aquaculture_Risk_Assessment.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:93R4qa3XnloJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 10, "2013": 2, "2014": 10, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
