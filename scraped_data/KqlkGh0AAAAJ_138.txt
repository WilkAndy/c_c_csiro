We tested this assumption at 32 coastal sites in southern Australia, spanning a wide geographic range. Annual IST regimes are described and were demonstrated to be highly correlated with SST. Mean annual daily temperature differences between SST and IST (DTD) were generally small, varying spatially and seasonally (range 0\u20131\u00b0C). No correlation between DTDs and a range of site attributes was found, indicating the importance of site-specific factors. Seasonal DTDs were not geographically consistent, being higher in South Australia during the summer (mean 1.4\u00b0C) than in Tasmania (mean 0.5\u00b0C). Generally, small annual mean DTDs justify using SST for broad-scale ecological and climate-change studies, although considerable DTDs at some \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4938071129902094913", "cites_id": ["4938071129902094913"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf14340", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QRptlYeNh0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
