While evidence for changes in physical signals is often distinct, impacts on fishes inhabiting oceanic systems are not easily identified, and therefore, quantification of responses is less common. Correctly attributing changes associated with a changing climate from other drivers is important for the implementation of effective harvest and management strategies and for addressing associated socio-economic impacts, particularly for countries highly dependent on oceanic resources. Data supporting investigation of responses of oceanic species to climate impacts include fisheries catch, fisheries-independent surveys, and conventional and electronic tagging data. However, there are a number of challenges associated with detecting climatic responses with these data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5120609848351238513", "cites_id": ["5120609848351238513"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0716-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:calX5IYPEEcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
