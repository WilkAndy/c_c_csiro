While these approaches can work for relatively stationary marine resources, to be most effective marine management must be as fluid in space and time as the resources and users we aim to manage. Instead, a shift towards dynamic ocean management is suggested, defined as management that rapidly changes in space and time in response to changes in the ocean and its users through the integration of near real-time biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data. Dynamic management can refine the temporal and spatial scale of managed areas, thereby better balancing ecological and economic objectives. Temperature dependent habitat of a hypothetical mobile marine species was simulated to show the efficiency of dynamic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 439, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1251594243900662879", "cites_id": ["1251594243900662879"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X15000639", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X2SfZlWOXhEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 6, "2016": 30, "2017": 50, "2018": 47, "2019": 63, "2020": 66, "2021": 61, "2022": 62, "2023": 31}}
