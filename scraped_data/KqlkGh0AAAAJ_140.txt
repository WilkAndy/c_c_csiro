Quantifying and monitoring species\u2019 suitable environmental habitats is a pragmatic approach for assessing changes in species distributions but is underdeveloped for quantifying climate change induced range shifts in marine systems. Specifically, habitat predictions present opportunities for quantifying spatiotemporal distribution changes while accounting for sources of natural climate variation. Here we demonstrate the utility of a marine\u2010based habitat model parameterized using citizen science data and remotely sensed environmental covariates for quantifying shifts in oceanographic habitat suitability over 22 years for a coastal\u2010pelagic fish species in a climate change hotspot. Our analyses account for the effects of natural intra\u2010 and interannual climate variability to reveal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4082189809960791528", "cites_id": ["4082189809960791528"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14398", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6K1u-ADapjgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
