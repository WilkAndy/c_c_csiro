However, we have little information on the nature of these autonomous adaptations that are being initiated by resource user-groups. The east coast of Tasmania, Australia, is one of the world\u2019s fastest warming marine regions with extensive climate-driven changes in biodiversity already observed. We present and compare examples of autonomous adaptations from marine users of the region to provide insights into factors that may have constrained or facilitated the available range of autonomous adaptation options and discuss potential interactions with governmental planned adaptations. We aim to support effective adaptation by identifying the suite \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2967042027951752839", "cites_id": ["2967042027951752839"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-019-01186-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hwa4HQENLSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 11, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
