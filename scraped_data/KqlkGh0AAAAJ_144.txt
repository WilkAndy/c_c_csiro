Squid were obtained from the fishing ports of: Ulladulla, New South Wales; Port Lincoln, South Australia; Lakes Entrance, Victoria; and Hobart, Tasmania. Squid were collected during 2 seasonal periods: summer/autumn-caught (warm-season squid) and spring-caught (cool-season squid) over 2 consecutive years (2000, 2001). N. gouldi is a sexually dimorphic species, with females generally reaching larger sizes than males. Initial genetic analysis has found only a single species in Australian waters. Statolith ageing revealed that squid completed their life cycle in< 1 yr, and appear to hatch throughout the year. Trends in size, growth and maturity varied considerably between sites, seasons and years. Squids hatched in summer/autumn grew consistently faster than squid that hatched in winter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1416224647590870507", "cites_id": ["1416224647590870507"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v264/p57-71/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:633OQdBwpxMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
