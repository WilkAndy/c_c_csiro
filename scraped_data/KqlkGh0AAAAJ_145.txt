A number of conflicts and trade-offs exist in the harvesting of pelagic species, including (i) maximizing future food production given the depleted state of some stocks; (ii) minimizing bycatch of non-target species, (iii) setting ecosystem allocation rules for non-target top predators, such as seabirds, and (iv) maximizing value and livelihoods for local economies. Climate change can be expected to exacerbate some of these conflicts as the ranges of species and their habitats change over varying geographic, depth and temporal scales. Understanding the distribution of these impacts can be difficult due to the scarcity of observational data on species and ecosystems. Resolving all these conflicts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13883671787488243956", "cites_id": ["13883671787488243956"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064514003014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9HBZj-61rMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 10, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
