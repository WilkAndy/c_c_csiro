These impacts, many of which are projected to increase in future, are compounded by growing pressures on marine resources (Halpern et al. 2008; Maxwell et al. 2013). An estimated 260 million people are involved directly or indirectly in global marine fisheries (Teh and Sumaila 2013) with many of the resources for capture fisheries already fully (&57% in 2009) or over exploited (30%)(FAO 2012). Nevertheless, production of marine resources will need to increase to accommodate the demands of a growing population, and the impacts of climate change on food security will need to be minimised (FAO 2009 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16315863874185400888", "cites_id": ["16315863874185400888"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-014-9355-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OBJzmL-XbeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
