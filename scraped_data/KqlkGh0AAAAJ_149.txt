Shifts in the relative abundance of small pelagic fish species have signalled a change in the ocean environment in a number of locations. Here we show that the replacement of jack mackerel, Trachurus declivis, with redbait, Emmelichthys nitidus, as the dominant small pelagic species from eastern Tasmania, following a period of high fishing pressure on jack mackerel, is consistent with altered zooplankton communities and long-term climate change. Stomach contents analysis and morphology measurements were conducted on both species to determine if they were functionally equivalent with regard to zooplankton prey. Diet varied between species and with fish size. Krill (Nyctiphanes australis) was \u2026McLeod, D. J., Hobday, A. J., Lyle, J. M., and Welsford, D. C. 2012.
