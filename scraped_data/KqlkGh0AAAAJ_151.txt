Many species are and will continue to struggle to persist in their current location as their preferred environment changes. Traditional conservation efforts aiming to prevent local extinctions have focused on two aspects that theoretically enhance genetic diversity\u2014population connectivity and population size\u2014through \u2018passive interventions\u2019 (such as protected areas and connectivity corridors). However, the exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity that we are experiencing as result of anthropogenic climate change has shifted conservation approaches to more \u2018active interventions\u2019 (such as rewilding, assisted gene flow, assisted evolution, artificial selection, genetic engineering). We integrate genetic/genomic approaches into an evolutionary biology framework in order to discuss with scientists, conservation managers and decision makers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2697061245579548904", "cites_id": ["2697061245579548904"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15359", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Ng9yOnibSUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 12, "2022": 24, "2023": 3}}
