In some regions, such redistributions are already causing dramatic shifts in marine socioecological systems, profoundly altering ecosystem structure and function, challenging domestic and international fisheries, and impacting on human communities. Such effects are expected to become increasingly widespread as waters continue to warm and species ranges continue to shift. Actions taken over the coming decade (2021\u20132030) can help us adapt to species redistributions and minimise negative impacts on ecosystems and human communities, achieving a more sustainable future in the face of ecosystem change. We describe key drivers related to climate-driven species redistributions that are likely to have a high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16238049753411335305", "cites_id": ["16238049753411335305"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-021-09641-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ibQzxTckWeEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 9, "2022": 21, "2023": 8}}
