Different states harvest and export different lobster species, with most of the landings being sent to the Hong Kong market. A perception in the Australian lobster industry is that the different species are independent on the export market, such that a change in landings of one species has no impact on the price of the others. This study investigates the market integration of Australian exports to Hong Kong for the four species and different exporting states. Our results indicate all four species and producers/export states are perceived to be substitutes for one another, so that, in the long run, prices paid to operators in the industry will move together. The integrated nature of the Hong Kong export market for Australian lobster suggests that the potential impacts of alternative fisheries management and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15140093312151841153", "cites_id": ["15140093312151841153"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8489.12020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gekT2aZqHNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
