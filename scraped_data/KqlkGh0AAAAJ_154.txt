We present a method for integrating archival tag data into a spatial tag\u2013recapture model for estimating natural mortality, fishing mortality, abundance, and movement. Archival tags provide important information on fish movement not available from conventional tags that facilitates separation of movement from mortality estimates. Using simulations, we evaluate the benefit of including archival tag data in the model using two model formulations: one with a general spatial structure and one with movement and fishery dynamics based on juvenile southern bluefin tuna (SBT; Thunnus maccoyii). If fish are not tagged in all regions and time periods, then including archival tag data can substantially improve the precision of the fishing mortality and movement \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4796185962479783068", "cites_id": ["4796185962479783068"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f2012-026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nIxSurh5j0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 5}}
