To investigate movement and local residence times of one such predator we implanted 29 acoustic tags into juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) (SBT) in the Great Australian Bight. We used acoustic detectors at a reef known to attract tuna and detected fifteen SBT on 941 occasions over 62 days. SBT were tagged at the reef, 40 km, and 120 km distant. A total of 100% of local and 60% of SBT tagged 40 km away were subsequently recorded at the reef. Presence and absence was related to an upwelling event. Water temperature decreased just after SBT departure from the monitoring region. The immediate area was aerially surveyed 22 times for SBT schools during the experiment. We combined aerial survey observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4316442253494925563", "cites_id": ["4316442253494925563"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF07001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-zgNLVwV5zsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
