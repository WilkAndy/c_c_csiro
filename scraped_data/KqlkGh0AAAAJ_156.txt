These are briefly reviewed, and a new hypothesis is proposed. We suggest that the appearance of the juvenile human hymen is based on 'premature' birth, following which infant helplessness and a subsequent advantage for vaginal protection from external sources of infection allowed natural selection to increase its persistence well into juvenile life."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5328984521413735265", "cites_id": ["5328984521413735265"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987797902231", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YbNrJDBb9EkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
