Biological time series data are thus urgently needed for the world's oceans. Here, we use the carbon stable isotope composition of tuna to provide a first insight into the existence of global trends in complex ecosystem dynamics and changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. From 2000 to 2015, considerable declines in \u03b413C values of 0.8\u2030\u20132.5\u2030 were observed across three tuna species sampled globally, with more substantial changes in the Pacific Ocean compared to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Tuna recorded not only the Suess effect, that is, fossil fuel\u2010derived and isotopically light carbon being incorporated into marine ecosystems, but also recorded profound changes at the base of marine food webs.
