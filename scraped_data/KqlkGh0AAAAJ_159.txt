The emphasis is on the implications for economies of Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). It concludes with general recommendations that should help the regional and national management agencies and other stakeholders in fisheries to adapt to maintain the benefits of fisheries.The assessments of the projected effects of climate change, and the recommended approaches for adaptation, are preliminary. They are derived from the early phases of a major regional project to assess the vulnerability of fisheries and aquaculture in the Pacific to climate change coordinated by SPC and supported by AusAID1. The project is due to be completed by mid 2010 and will deliver a much more comprehensive assessment of likely impacts, practical adaptations, and investments needed to address key gaps in knowledge."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13842130577715565108", "cites_id": ["13842130577715565108"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Janice-Lough/publication/235980104_Preliminary_assessment_of_the_effects_of_climate_change_on_fisheries_and_aquaculture_in_the_Pacific/links/0c9605251f163900ff000000/Preliminary-assessment-of-the-effects-of-climate-change-on-fisheries-and-aquaculture-in-the-Pacific.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NBJP82sgGcAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
