A growth model of C. rodgersii is developed allowing estimation of a sea urchin age profile and, in combination with abundance data, we correlate the sea urchin population dynamic with respect to environmental signals across the range extension region. Growth patterns did not vary across the extension region; however, there was a strong pattern of decreasing sea urchin age with increasing distance from the historic range. The sequential poleward discovery of the sea urchin, a pattern of declining age and a general poleward reduction in abundance along the eastern Tasmanian coastline are consistent with a model of range extension \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 398, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5565457513544891747", "cites_id": ["5565457513544891747"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01734.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yz1fGx96PE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 13, "2010": 11, "2011": 37, "2012": 28, "2013": 35, "2014": 36, "2015": 31, "2016": 34, "2017": 19, "2018": 31, "2019": 34, "2020": 36, "2021": 22, "2022": 21, "2023": 6}}
