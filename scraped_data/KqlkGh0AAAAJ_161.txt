Here we develop a new quantitative metric that is analogous to indices used to analyse food-webs and identify key species. The Supply Chain Index (SCI) identifies critical elements as those elements with large throughput rates, as well as greater connectivity. The sum of the scores for a supply chain provides a single metric that roughly captures both the resilience and connectedness of a supply chain. Standardised scores can facilitate cross-comparisons both under current conditions as well as under a changing climate. Identification of key elements along the supply chain may assist in informing adaptation strategies to reduce anticipated future risks posed by climate change. The SCI also provides information on the relative stability of different supply chains based on whether there is a fairly even spread in the individual scores of the top few key elements, compared with a more critical dependence on a few key individual supply chain elements. We use as a case study the Australian southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery, which is challenged by a number of climate change drivers such as impacts on recruitment and growth due to changes in large-scale and local oceanographic features. The SCI identifies airports, processors and Chinese consumers as the key elements in the lobster supply chain that merit attention to enhance stability and potentially enable growth. We also apply the index to an additional four real-world Australian commercial fishery and two aquaculture industry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17253765498434909555", "cites_id": ["17253765498434909555"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091833", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c3UadE6wce8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 5}}
