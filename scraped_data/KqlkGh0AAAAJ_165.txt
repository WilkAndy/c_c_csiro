Central to many assessments are statistical and dynamical models of populations, communities, ecosystems, and their socioeconomic systems and management frameworks. The establishment of a national system that could facilitate the development of such model-based assessments has been identified as a priority for addressing management challenges for Australia\u2019s marine environment. Given that most assessments require cross-scale information, individual models cannot capture all of the spatial, temporal, biological, and socioeconomic scales that are typically needed. Coupling or integrating models across scales and domains can expand the scope for developing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10756522350361779599", "cites_id": ["10756522350361779599"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/74/9/2298/3855111", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jx3dTxbYRpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
