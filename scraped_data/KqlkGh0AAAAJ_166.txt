In south-eastern Australia, a marine global warming hotspot, evidence suggests that climate change will profoundly affect pinnipeds and seabirds. Long-term data series are available to assess some species\u2019 responses to climate. Researchers have measured a variety of chronological and population variables, such as laying dates, chick or pup production, colony-specific abundance and breeding success. Here, we consider the challenges in accurately assessing trends in marine predator data, using long-term data series that were originally collected for other purposes, and how these may be driven by environmental change and variability. In the past, many studies of temporal changes and environmental drivers used linear analyses and we demonstrate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=897356263852712004", "cites_id": ["897356263852712004"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-014-0634-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RKDpf8QMdAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
