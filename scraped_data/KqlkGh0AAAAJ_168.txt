However, they suggest that two challenges, defining 'targeted' MPAs and enforcement, are more significant than we recognized. Using the example of skipjack tuna, the authors argue that defining 'targeted MPAs' (we assume for a particular species) can be problematic given the lack of site fidelity of some pelagic animals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15349017126530774271,6884144093087432298", "cites_id": ["15349017126530774271", "6884144093087432298"], "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/5011/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:__RABsGpAtUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 6, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
