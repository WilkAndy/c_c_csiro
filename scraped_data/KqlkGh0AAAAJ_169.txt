Delivery of these products offers resource managers and users relevant insight into ecosystem patterns and future conditions to support decisions these stakeholders face associated with a range of objectives. The pace of progress in forecast development is so rapid that the scientific community may not be considering fully the impacts on stakeholders and their incentives. Delivery of information, particularly about future conditions and the uncertainties associated with it, involves a range of judgements, or \u201cethical\u201d considerations, including treatment of forecast failure, inequity in stakeholder response options, and winners and losers in commercial markets. Here, we explore these often unanticipated considerations via a set of case studies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:hvmnpdAuIbkC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5679725860749875019", "cites_id": ["5679725860749875019"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/76/5/1244/5303214", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:S5eY75Nw0k4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 7, "2021": 11, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
