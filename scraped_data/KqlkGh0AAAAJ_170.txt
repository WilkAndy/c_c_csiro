To effectively adapt, marine resource users require information relevant to their activities at decision-making timescales. We model oceanographic habitat suitability for kingfish (Seriola lalandi) from south-eastern Australia using multiple environmental variables at monthly time steps over the period 1996\u20132040. Habitat predictions were used to quantify the temporal persistence (months per year) of suitable oceanographic habitat within six coastal bioregions. A decline in temporal habitat persistence is predicted for the northernmost (equatorward) bioregion, whereas increases are predicted for the three southernmost (poleward) bioregions. We suggest that temporal habitat persistence is an important metric for climate change adaptation because it provides fishery-relevant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10481317531930641101", "cites_id": ["10481317531930641101"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf17387", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zcLMTMMedZEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 11}}
