The area encompassed by the exclusive economic zones of these countries and territories, from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in the north (25 N) to New Caledonia in the south (25 S), and from Palau in the west (130 E) to Pitcairn Islands in the east (130 W), exceeds 27 million km2 (Figure 1.1) iii. From a fisheries perspective, the ocean area bounded by these islands almost matches the tropical portion of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) defined in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Conventioniv. From an oceanographic viewpoint, it includes the area known as the western tropical Pacific Ocean.It comes as no surprise given this vast area that the region covered by the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) is one of great geological, biological and social diversity. The region has historically been divided into three subregions in recognition of this diversity\u2013Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia\u2013based on the physical nature of the islands, biogeography, and ethnic and cultural factors (Figure 1.1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10978401112519476021", "cites_id": ["10978401112519476021"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Johann-Bell/publication/275328681_Pacific_communities_fisheries_aquaculture_and_climate_change_An_introduction/links/553756d30cf2058efdeab71b/Pacific-communities-fisheries-aquaculture-and-climate-change-An-introduction.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NQN6UaUdW5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
