In this contribution we describe how pop-up satellite archival tagging data have been incorporated into a habitat prediction model to support spatial management in an Australian longline fishery, specifically through reduction of unwanted bycatch of a quota-managed species, southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii). This model, and its practical application, has evolved over time (2002-present), due to the successful cooperation between scientists, fishery managers and stakeholders. To illustrate this example of successful use of tag data in management, we review the appropriate biology of SBT and its\u2019 interaction with the fishery, the management challenge that tagging and the habitat model helped resolve, and how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5310957371480180633", "cites_id": ["5310957371480180633"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-9640-2_23", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mYdROJdPtEkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
