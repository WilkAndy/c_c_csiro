While there has been significant and increasing work on understanding specific effects of climate change on coral reef fishes, few studies have considered large-bodied fisheries target species, limiting understanding of the effects of climate change on tropical fisheries. This review focuses on coral grouper (Plectropomus spp., and mainly Plectropomus leopardus), which are heavily fished throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans, and represent an exemplar group to assess potential effects of climate change on coral reef fisheries. In experimental studies, P. leopardus appear to be extremely sensitive to increasing ocean temperature, exhibiting declines in survivorship, aerobic scope and activity with relatively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18118094046045946892", "cites_id": ["18118094046045946892"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-016-9455-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DESwhYpmcPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
