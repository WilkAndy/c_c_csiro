Concerted research and development by regional agencies shows that nearshore fish aggregating devices (FADs) provide one way for small-scale fishers to make this transition. Although the full potential of FADs remains to be assessed, several investments to optimise their use have been identified. These investments include pinpointing the locations where FADs are likely to make the greatest contributions to nutrition of coastal communities, integrating use of FADs with other livelihood activities, and improving the designs of FADs. Where Pacific Island countries have committed to developing nearshore FAD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:UmS_249rOGwC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6584238736488349972", "cites_id": ["6584238736488349972"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17301161", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FEHB_D7qX1sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
