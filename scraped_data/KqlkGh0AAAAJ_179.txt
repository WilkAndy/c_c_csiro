These tools may also be applicable to species targeted by the recreational fisheries sector, a sector that is increasing its use of marine resources, and making important economic and social contributions to coastal communities around the world. Here, a seasonal forecast of the habitat and density of dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), based on sea surface temperatures, was developed for the east coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Two prototype forecast products were created; geographic spatial forecasts of dolphinfish habitat and a latitudinal summary identifying the location of fish density peaks. The less detailed latitudinal summary was created to limit the resolution of habitat information to prevent potential resource over-exploitation by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6570468871587441981", "cites_id": ["6570468871587441981"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064517300632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PS27eqD-LlsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
