Information about future climate conditions on a range of time scales can improve risk management, buffer production against unfavourable environmental conditions, and allow maximised production during opportune times. Seasonal forecasting, providing information beyond weather forecasting up to several months into the future, can aid such decision making. In north-east Australian coastal pond-based prawn farms environmental stresses influence timing of farming periods, animal growth and survival. Here we describe the development, packaging and provision of regional and local forecast products, derived from the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA; version 2), to the Queensland prawn industry.
