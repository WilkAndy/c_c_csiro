Under this framework, vulnerability to the physical effects of climate change can be reduced by adaptation options that reduce exposure of individuals, reduce the sensitivity of individuals, and increase the adaptive capacity of individual/species to cope with climate change. We evaluated options in each vulnerability category with three screening tools collectively forming an approach we term sequential adaptation prioritization for species. These tools were designed to evaluate (i) technical aspects (cost-benefit-risk, CBR), (ii) institutional barriers, and (iii) potential social acceptability. The CBR tool identified which adaptation options were high cost and low benefit, might be discarded, and which were high benefit and low cost, might be rapidly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13268486873719286003", "cites_id": ["13268486873719286003"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-015-1007-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:86j4HoMiI7gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
