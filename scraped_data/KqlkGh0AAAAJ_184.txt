However, at remote animal colonies, metrics derived from sequential counts or other continuous monitoring are often subject to logistical, weather and disturbance challenges. The development of remote camera technologies has assisted monitoring, but limitations in spatial and temporal resolution and sample sizes remain. Here, we describe the application of a robotic camera system (Gigapan) which takes a tiled sequence of photographs that are automatically stitched together to form high\u2010resolution panoramas. We demonstrate the application of the Gigapan using data collected during field testing at a shy albatross colony on Albatross Island in northwest Tasmania. We took daily panoramas over 5 days to estimate mean incubation shift duration, an indirect \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=863579040602517439", "cites_id": ["863579040602517439"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12339", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:v--V3o8M_AsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 7}}
