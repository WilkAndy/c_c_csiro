We examine the supply chains of the Australian tropical rock lobster fishery (TRL) and southern rock lobster fishery (SRL), with similar destination markets but different catch methods and fishing communities. A boat\u2010to\u2010market analysis allows for comparison and illustration of the effects of single supply\u2010chain aspects. We used life cycle assessment to provide an overview of the environmental footprint, expressed as global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, and cumulative energy demand, for two lobster products: live animals and frozen tails. The export phase contributed 44% and 56% of GWP of live\u2010weight lobster for SRL and TRL, respectively. The SRL fishery currently produces 68% of the combined 1,806.7 tonnes of lobster \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12739921688304200038", "cites_id": ["12739921688304200038"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jiec.12382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZqmqyUZLzbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
