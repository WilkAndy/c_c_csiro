But these ecosystems are deteriorating rapidly and many of the world's oceanic fisheries are in a precarious condition. In addition to well-known and pressing fishery management issues, economic globalization is connecting fisheries beyond the frontiers of the organizations responsible for their management and climate-associated changes are deeply modifying ecosystems, pushing them toward new states and no return situations. The status quo is not a sustainable option, and improved international governance is urgently needed to address this situation. Our proposition consists of an inclusive global science\u2013policy process combining major improvements to the present governance systems, including new incentives for international cooperation and coordination, with an ambitious scientific program to help anticipate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10594902542761620940", "cites_id": ["10594902542761620940"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187734351300050X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zHUwe7qnCJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
