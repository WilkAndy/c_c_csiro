It begins by summarising the observed and projected changes to the physical and chemical features of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), and how these changes are expected to alter fish habitats. For each of the main types of fisheries in the WCPO, the chapter then explains how the direct and indirect effects of continued carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to affect the distribution and abundance of fish stocks; the implications for economic development, government revenue, food security and livelihoods; and the adaptations needed to minimize the threats and maximize opportunities. The analyses presented here are based on global and regional modelling approaches that use the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) from the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), or emission scenarios from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The likelihood and confidence ratings for the key messages have been attributed using the IPCC method."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:A8cqit5AE6sC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11909331714388384842", "cites_id": ["11909331714388384842"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=1jl8DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA305&dq=info:StxpjBhyRqUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Y2T2QAlrnl&sig=D99rpUBko06-SUMWRHNe_O_r_7o", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:StxpjBhyRqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
