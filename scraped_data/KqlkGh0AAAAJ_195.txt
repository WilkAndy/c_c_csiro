However, many species have also been recorded in association with nearshore topographic structures. The relative abundance of four pelagic species at and away from topographic features on the continental shelf, as inferred from fine-scale catch data collected over a 7-year period, was examined for southern Western Australia. A total of 1056 captures were recorded from 890h of trolling over 102 days: the top four species accounted for 97.5% of all captures. Eight distinct topographic features received 13.7% of the total trolling effort and produced 43.8% of captures. The percentage of all captures within 1km of these features were 80% for yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi, YTK), 50% for bonito (Sarda australia, BON), 27% for southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii, SBT), and less than 5% for skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8069633326725598125", "cites_id": ["8069633326725598125"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016578360800324X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rQsig8EY_W8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
