We develop a fishery-level assessment of economic resilience to climate change for the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, a linked social\u2013ecological system. We outline the main climate change forcing influences that link climate change to the fishery via changes in lobster abundance, distribution, and phenology. Using a bottom-up approach, we identify twelve economic attributes strongly related to the fisheries\u2019 economic resilience to climate change. Resilience attributes are grouped according to the level of the economic domain (business, sectoral, and governance). Attributes are then evaluated to determine the overall economic resilience of the rock lobster fishery in the context of the specific nature of predicted climate change effects. We identify areas of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11327404111057678349", "cites_id": ["11327404111057678349"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-013-0456-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DXDkGgYGM50J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
