The future state of aquatic environments can be estimated by extrapolation of historical trends. However, because the climate is a complex non-linear system, a more process-based approach is probably required, in particular the use of dynamical projections using climate models. Because global climate models operate on spatial scales that typically are too coarse for aquatic biologists, statistical or dynamical downscaling of model output is proposed. Challenges in using climate projections exist; however, projections for some marine and freshwater systems are possible. Higher oceanic temperatures are projected around Australia, particularly for south-eastern Australia. The East Australia Current is projected to transport greater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 345, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18367075773900944322", "cites_id": ["18367075773900944322"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf10302", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wnMMehr25P4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 10, "2012": 19, "2013": 30, "2014": 45, "2015": 35, "2016": 42, "2017": 37, "2018": 29, "2019": 13, "2020": 33, "2021": 24, "2022": 18, "2023": 7}}
