Such markets would allow two parties with different tolerances and expectations about climate risks to transact for their mutual benefit and, in so doing, finance climate adaptation. Here we calculate the price of a derivative called a European put option, based on future sea surface temperature (SST) in Tasmania, Australia, with an 18 \u00b0C strike threshold. This price represents a quantifiable indicator of climate risk, and forms the basis for aquaculture industries exposed to the risk of higher SST to finance adaptation strategies through the sale of derivative contracts. Such contracts provide a real incentive to parties with different climate outlooks, or risk exposure to take a market assessment of climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17052695102154416040", "cites_id": ["17052695102154416040"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221209631500011X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qB_1qthXp-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
