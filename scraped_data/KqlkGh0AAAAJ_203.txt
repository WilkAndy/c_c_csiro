Seventy acoustic receivers were deployed at three cross\u2010shelf lines and three coastal topographic features (lumps) between December and May. We observed markedly different patterns of habitat utilization between the three seasons: (i) aggregation at lumps in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007, and (ii) wide distribution over the continental shelf (i.e., few occurring at lumps) in 2005/2006. Vertical profile by conductivity\u2010temperature\u2010depth casts showed these spatial shifts were caused by interannual changes in the presence of sub\u2010Antarctic water. The sub\u2010Antarctic water was present in the subsurface layer close to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11356128363732378106", "cites_id": ["11356128363732378106"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2010.00536.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-qEBWJQSmZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 2}}
