General ocean warming around Australia, particularly on the east coast due to strengthening of the East Australian Current, is predicted to change the distribution and abundance of species targeted by marine fisheries, and change the location of suitable environments for aquaculture species. Understanding changes in species' distributions will facilitate adaptation by fisheries management to climate change. Management and policy changes will be needed in some cases to allow appropriate responses by these marine industries to such climate-related change. In addition to changing distributions, climate change is expected to affect the dynamics and productivity of many exploited species. This has important consequences for fisheries assessments as most approaches assume that population dynamics are relatively constant over time-termed'stationarity'. Focused regional studies on the relationship between the climate variables and the species of interest will improve understanding of the potential impacts of climate change. Selective breeding programs will adapt some aquaculture species for warmer conditions, but changes in farm location may be required for some businesses. Development of decision-support tools for stakeholders and managers, together with improved delivery of climate information, will enhance adaptation in these marine industries. Such tools must be robust in the face of the increased uncertainty as a result of climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16095058106542830150", "cites_id": ["16095058106542830150"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103078917", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RrLBlxIiXd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
