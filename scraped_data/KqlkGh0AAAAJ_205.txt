Climate change will further exacerbate this situation over the coming decades unless effective interventions are implemented. Evaluating the efficacy of alternative interventions in a complex system experiencing major cumulative impacts can only be achieved through a systems modelling approach. We have evaluated combinations of interventions using a coral reef meta-community model. The model consisted of a dynamic network of 3753 reefs supporting communities of corals and CoTS connected through ocean larval dispersal, and exposed to changing regimes of tropical cyclones, flood plumes, marine heatwaves and ocean acidification. Interventions included reducing flood plume impacts, expanding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:g_UdREhPGEoC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14130608419874291269", "cites_id": ["14130608419874291269"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsos.201296", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RT7Ann0BGsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 6, "2022": 17, "2023": 1}}
