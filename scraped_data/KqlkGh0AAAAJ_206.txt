Scientists clearly have an important role to play in preparing for and responding to climate change impacts; however, calls by scientists for global action have not led to the required changes. It is timely, therefore, for scientists to critically consider their own approach toward climate change research, particularly if we are to ameliorate or adapt to unwanted outcomes. Here we present three different pathways that allow scientists and scientific institutions to conceptualize the implications of their responses to climate change scenarios. These pathways are illustrated via three plausible futures for the marine environment under climate change. This approach allows future responsibilities, outcomes, and implication to be explored within and across pathways and can be applied to different scenarios for scientists and scientific institutions to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8649079096203790294", "cites_id": ["8649079096203790294"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018EF000990", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1sd7-5yzB3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
