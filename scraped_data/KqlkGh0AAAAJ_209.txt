The responses of fish populations to variability in the marine environment have implications for decision making processes associated with resource management. There is still considerable uncertainty in estimating the responses of tuna populations to short-to-medium-term variability and longer-term change in the oceanic environment. A workshop was organised to examine how advances in oceanography, fisheries science and fisheries economics could be applied to the tuna fisheries of the WCPO and in doing so identify research priorities to improve understanding relevant to progressing management. Research priorities identified included: (i) improved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3815045996584918458", "cites_id": ["3815045996584918458"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X15001335", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ul049B7E8TQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
