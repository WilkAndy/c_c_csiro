Despite this, public and political awareness of the scale and significance of this marine ecosystem is low, and research investment miniscule (<10%), relative to comparable ecosystems. The absence of an identity for Australia\u2019s temperate reefs as an entity has probably contributed to the current lack of appreciation of this system, which is at odds with its profound ecological, social and economic importance. We define the \u2018Great Southern Reef\u2019 (GSR) as Australia\u2019s spatially connected temperate reef system. The GSR covers ~71000km2 and represents a global biodiversity hotspot across at least nine phyla. GSR-related fishing and tourism generates at least AU$10 billion year\u20131, and in this context the GSR is a significant natural asset for Australia and globally.
