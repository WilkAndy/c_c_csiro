These data present challenges not encountered with traditional, fit-for-purpose scientific data, including engaging with data owners, building trust and maintaining relationships, analysing and interpreting data collected under varying methodologies, and the possibility that data may not suit an intended purpose. Here we describe engagement activities undertaken with recreational spearfishers to collate and examine spearfishing club data collected from competitions held throughout south-eastern Australia from the 1960s until the present, representing one of the most extensive citizen science datasets for marine species in the region. The data proved suitable for demonstrating change in coastal fish communities, some of which were consistent with expectations given a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9c2xU6iGI7YC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14823540316358509631", "cites_id": ["14823540316358509631"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF14071", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PwQ7FmHLt80J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
