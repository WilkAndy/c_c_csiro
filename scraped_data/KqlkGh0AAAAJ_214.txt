In the shallow\u2010water/coastal marine environment, ENSO\u2010related extremes in sea level and seawater temperature have been found to impact coral, kelp, seagrass, and mangrove ecosystems. Coastal impacts from sea level extremes include exposure of shallow\u2010water ecosystems and inundation in low\u2010lying areas. Ocean temperature extremes, including marine heatwaves, cause coral bleaching and can impact kelp and seagrass density. This chapter reviews knowledge and understanding of ENSO's role in sea level extremes and ocean temperature extremes, and their impacts on these key shallow\u2010water/coastal marine ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:WWeOtg8bX_EC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13661673331060240938", "cites_id": ["13661673331060240938"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119548164.ch18", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KvJFD4MDmL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 8, "2022": 14, "2023": 1}}
