Complex synergies between concurrent environmental stressors and the resilience of the system to regime shifts, which vary in space and time, determine the capacity for marine systems to maintain structure and function with global environmental change. Consequently, an interdisciplinary approach that facilitates the development of new methods for the exchange of knowledge between scientists across multiple scales is required to effectively understand, quantify and predict climate impacts on marine ecosystem services. We use a literature review to assess the limitations and assumptions of current pathways to exchange interdisciplinary knowledge and the transferability of research findings across spatial and temporal scales and levels of biological organization to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:RJOyoaXV5v8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11061926634180625345", "cites_id": ["11061926634180625345"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14168", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wcPESarbg5kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
