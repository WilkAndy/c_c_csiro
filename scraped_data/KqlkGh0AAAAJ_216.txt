Together, fisheries and aquaculture provide 4.3 billion people with~ 15% of their average per capita intake of animal protein. By 2050, an additional 75 million tonnes of fish will be needed to help feed more than 9 billion people.\u2022 The recent revolution in aquaculture, and continued improvements to management of capture fisheries, have potential to provide the additional fish required. However, warming of the world\u2019s ocean could disrupt these important initiatives.\u2022 Ocean warming will result in \u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers. Changes in distributions of fish stocks as species seek their optimal temperatures, and as the habitats on which they depend are altered by higher water temperatures, will result in decreases in fisheries production in some countries and increases in others. Similarly, the prime locations for mariculture are expected to be altered by ocean warming, resulting in changes in yield patterns among countries.\u2022 The effects of ocean warming on the contributions of marine fisheries and mariculture to food security should not be considered in isolation from those of other drivers. Rapid population growth, fish exports and poor fisheries management also affect availability of fish in many developing countries. These drivers often create a gap between how much fish is needed for good nutrition and local fish harvests. The main effects of ocean warming are to alter (increase or decrease) the gap."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17159610282348399539", "cites_id": ["17159610282348399539"], "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/ocrd/294983.pdf#page=411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s0uE46IuI-4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
