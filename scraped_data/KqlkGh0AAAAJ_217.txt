Recent interest has led to the explicit recognition of this habitat type under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention), an international treaty that has widespread governmental and scientific involvement. To assess the state of knowledge, the Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands (RIS) for marine and coastal Sites was searched for evidence that bivalve-reef habitat is present in the site. We then examined the quality of this information using alternative data sources. These were public databases of geolocated species records at three spatial scales, local and regional experts, and a general web search. It was found that of the 893 marine and coastal Ramsar Sites considered, the RIS for 16 Sites provided strong evidence of bivalve-reef habitat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17695212419550911675,14295885045151744235", "cites_id": ["17695212419550911675", "14295885045151744235"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF14306", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u5xpPPEFkvUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
