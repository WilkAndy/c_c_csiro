To prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks under changing and uncertain environmental conditions, new research partnerships between fisheries scientists and climate change experts are required. The International Workshop on Climate and Oceanic Fisheries held in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, 3\u20135 October 2011, brought representatives from these disciplines together to consider the effects of climate variability and change on oceanic fisheries, the tools and strategies required for identifying potential impacts on oceanic fisheries, and the priority adaptations for sustaining future harvests, especially in the Pacific Ocean. Recommendations made by the workshop included (1) development and implementation of sustainable management measures for fisheries \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9Nmd_mFXekcC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10608083075936826030", "cites_id": ["10608083075936826030"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-012-0652-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rjIMgVp7N5MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
