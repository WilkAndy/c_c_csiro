There are approximately 260 pelagic species around Australia. While some of the most well known are the large offshore apex predators such as tunas, billfish and sharks, the mid-trophic level small pelagic species, such as sardines, anchovies, and squids, are critical to ecosystem function. Pelagic fishes of all sizes have high ecological, economic and social value. The observed impacts of climate change are restricted to changes in local abundance and distribution, particularly southward range extensions. Little is known regarding changes in phenology, physiology or community structure. In future, general ocean warming around Australia and in particular on the east coast, in combination with predicted strengthening of the East Australia Current, is likely to see the distribution of a range of pelagic species extend southwards from present limits. On the west coast, changes in the strength of the Leeuwin Current are likely to have major implications for the distribution and abundance of some species, including western Australian salmon and Australian herring in waters off South Australia. Changes in productivity, for example due to increased coastal upwelling, may lead to increases in abundance of some species, particularly of small coastal pelagic fishes, such as sardines and anchovy, in the large upwelling system between Cape Otway and the central Great Australian Bight. Confidence in observed impacts is generally low to medium as observed changes are limited. Similarly, confidence in future impacts is also generally low to medium, as lack of data on observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1322510345804442074", "cites_id": ["1322510345804442074"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=b4cdc473ae97e90dd1927bf0440c229eb0c29385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2ulzDSeAWhIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
