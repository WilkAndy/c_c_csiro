Australian Government, Canberra. iv", "abstract": "This assessment of the ecological impacts of the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery was undertaken using the ERAEF method version 9.2. ERAEF stands for \u201cEcological Risk Assessment for Effect of Fishing\u201d, and was developed jointly by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. ERAEF provides a hierarchical framework for a comprehensive assessment of the ecological risks arising from fishing, with impacts assessed against five ecological components\u2013target species; by-product and by-catch species; threatened, endangered and protected (TEP) species; habitats; and (ecological) communities.ERAEF proceeds through four stages of analysis: scoping; an expert judgement based Level 1 analysis (SICA\u2013Scale Intensity Consequence Analysis); an empirically based Level 2 analysis (PSA\u2013Productivity Susceptibility Analysis); and a model based Level 3 analysis. This hierarchical approach provides a cost-efficient way of screening hazards, with increasing time and attention paid only to those hazards that are not eliminated at lower levels in the analysis. Risk management responses may be identified at any level in the analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12975581233862368352", "cites_id": ["12975581233862368352"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7bb069e8d06eb0b1b5edab67db58d750f65da714", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YFyXdmKGErQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
