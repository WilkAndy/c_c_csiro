Adaptation responses must be initiated in parallel with mitigation efforts, but resources are limited. As climate risks are not distributed equally across taxa, ecosystems and processes, strategic prioritization of research that addresses stakeholder\u2010relevant knowledge gaps will accelerate effective uptake into adaptation policy and management action. After a decade of climate change adaptation research within the Australian National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, we synthesize the National Adaptation Research Plans for marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We identify the key, globally relevant priorities for ongoing research relevant to informing adaptation policy and environmental management aimed at maximizing the resilience of natural ecosystems to climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:orDZ08hpP44C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12545742294751516587", "cites_id": ["12545742294751516587"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14856", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qxdCmiVuG64J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
