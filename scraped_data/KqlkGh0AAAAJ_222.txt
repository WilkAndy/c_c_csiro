There are however many different pressures exerted on Australian fish stocks, including climate-related changes that drive changes in local fish abundances. It is inevitable that recreational fishers will need to adapt to these changes. When resource abundance alters substantially, user adaptation to the new situation is required and policies and incentives may need to be developed to encourage behaviour change. It is important to correctly anticipate fisher's response to these policies and incentives as much as possible. Improved understanding of recreational fisher's likely adaptation decisions and the nature and timing of these decisions can help avoid unintended consequences of management decisions. Based on a survey of recreational fishers in the south-east Australian climate hotspot, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=291758479200309438", "cites_id": ["291758479200309438"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X16306212", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vlDxgMqIDAQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
