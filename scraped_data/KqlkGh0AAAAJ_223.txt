These decision-makers must address a pressing and overarching question \u2013 how will pelagic resources and pressures on such resources change over time and space? Answering this question requires ongoing inquiry into critical dimensions of pelagic species and systems, for both the commercial tuna species that are managed by Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs), as well as nearshore pelagic fishes that support many small-scale fisheries and are managed at national and local levels. Research priorities include generating further insight \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8170378942715335912", "cites_id": ["8170378942715335912"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064514003026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6BThIFwEY3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
