Climate change will lead to ocean warming, changes in ocean currents, increased intensity of storm events, and changed ocean chemistry associated with increased CO2 uptake.Climate change is very likely to affect marine biodiversity and resources, mainly through changes induced in the physical and chemical features of the marine environment such as ocean warming and changed ocean chemistry, which will trigger biological responses in marine organisms. It is also likely to have significant effects on important coastal habitats, including wetland, mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass ecosystems. Some of these changes have already been observed. The magnitude of the recent physical changes is greater than at any time during human civilization and, importantly, the rate of change is faster."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3506639610812486337", "cites_id": ["3506639610812486337"], "pub_url": "https://tamug-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/1969.3/29295/NARP%20marine%20biodiversity%20FORWEB.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wdLKpSUWqjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
