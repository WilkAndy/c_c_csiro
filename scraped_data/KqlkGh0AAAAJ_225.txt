In these waters an acoustic survey for SBT schools was initiated to generate a fisheries-independent abundance index. A decline in this abundance index led to an acoustic tagging and monitoring project to determine if a change in migration route or timing could explain the decline. Five years of acoustic monitoring revealed interannual differences in key factors that could impact the abundance index. Acoustic tag data were used to demonstrate that (i) a high proportion of fish (~70%) may be too shallow for detection in the acoustic survey, and that interannual variation in (ii) inshore-offshore fraction (~30\u201370% each year) and (iii) residence time (12\u201337 days) will impact calculation of an index. These factors should be included in estimating an abundance index for SBT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16934622414229658361", "cites_id": ["16934622414229658361"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-9640-2_24", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-dqGvVzdA-sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
