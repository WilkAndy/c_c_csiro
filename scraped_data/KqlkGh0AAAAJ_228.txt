The implications of large\u2010scale species redistribution for natural systems and human societies have resulted in a large number of studies exploring the effects on individual species and ecological communities worldwide. Whilst many studies have investigated discrete components of species redistribution, the integration required for a more complete mechanistic understanding is lacking. In this paper, we provide a framework for synthesising approaches to more robustly understand and predict marine species redistributions. We conceptualise the stages and processes involved in climate\u2010driven species redistribution at increasing levels of biological organisation, and synthesize the laboratory, field and modelling approaches used to study redistribution related processes at individual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:yeL6HyUMUGUC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14883990207759612381", "cites_id": ["14883990207759612381"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.04996", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3XnnNTyOjs4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
