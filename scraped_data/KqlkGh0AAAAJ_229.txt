Here, we enhance the existing sustainability assessment for fishing effect method by estimating gear efficiency and heterogeneous density from sporadic catch data. We apply the method to two chondrichthyan bycatch species, Bight Skate and Draughtboard Shark in Australia, to assess cumulative fishing mortality (Fcum) from multiple fisheries. Gear efficiency is estimated from a Bayesian mixture distribution model and fish density is predicted by a generalized additive model. These results, combined with actual fishing effort, allow estimation of fishing mortality in each sector and subsequently, the Fcum. Risk is quantified by comparing Fcum with reference points based on life history parameters. When only the point estimates were considered, our result \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:mel-f30kHHgC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6462035157762377876", "cites_id": ["6462035157762377876"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/76/4/837/5303697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lAiDGL3CrVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
