Adaptation has been a focus of recent international climate change negotiations and strong pledges have been made to help developing countries respond to the climate-related changes ahead.Australia is well aware of the potential effects of climate change on yields from agriculture and fisheries and we are deeply committed to helping our Pacific Island neighbours understand the vulnerability of their resources to these changes, and how best to respond. Together we must find ways to maintain the quality of life for all people in the region as the impacts of climate change intensify."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 311, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3602522968538878219", "cites_id": ["3602522968538878219"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=anVzlUv_864C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:CxHyio27_jEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=2JkImADe-U&sig=MD21JVQtrmqtHGWNozjXMs0w_6c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CxHyio27_jEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 20, "2013": 29, "2014": 35, "2015": 30, "2016": 38, "2017": 19, "2018": 39, "2019": 21, "2020": 27, "2021": 24, "2022": 20, "2023": 4}}
