We investigated patterns of SBT distribution within and inshore of the acoustic survey area during three summer seasons. Annual differences in distribution patterns were characterized by two distinctive migration pathways. An inshore-migrating pathway was observed in two seasons (2004/2005 and 2006/2007), with a relatively high proportion of tagged SBT (84.5, 65.0%) migrating inshore of the acoustic survey area. The other pathway was concentrated along the shelf (2005/2006 season), with an estimated 63.3% of tagged SBT moving within the survey area. These variable migration patterns may bias the interannual fluctuations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5376588305598299827", "cites_id": ["5376588305598299827"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12562-010-0228-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s7602pN6nUoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
