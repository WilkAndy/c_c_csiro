However, during 1995 several vessels began targeting swordfish off southern Queensland. Good catches were obtained around several seamounts within a region the Japanese traditionally referred to as the \u201cBrisbane Grounds.\u201d As a result of this initial success, and with increased access to the US market, between 1995 and 1996 the total retained catch of swordfish taken in the fishery increased 10-fold to around 817 t. The fishery continued to expand over the next few years and by 1999 the total catch of swordfish reached 3,076 t, becoming the largest catch component in the fishery for that year. During the next two years the annual catch of swordfish in the fishery declined, averaging around 2,620 t.The increase in the catch of swordfish was not solely due to an increased targeting of this species, but also coincided with a large expansion in the total effort in the Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery. Total annual effort increased from around 4 million hooks in 1994 to over 11 million hooks in 1999. The spatial extent of the fishery also increased, with the number of one-degree squares of latitude and longitude fished each year increasing from less than 130 before 1995 to around 250 during 2000. Most of this expansion occurred on the Brisbane Grounds (defined here as the region bounded by 24-34oS, 152-164oE and shown in Figure 1) where the number of one-degree squares fished increased three-fold (from 43 to 125 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6948262309718561210", "cites_id": ["6948262309718561210"], "pub_url": "https://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/Meetings/SCTB/16/BBRG_3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:upEC2cEvbWAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
