Optimal adaptation options are those which enable negative effects to be mitigated and opportunities that arise to be maximized, both in relation to specific climate-driven changes and the broader fisheries system. We developed a two-step participatory approach to evaluating adaption options for key fisheries in the fast-warming hotspot of south-eastern Australia. Four fisheries (southern rock lobster, abalone, snapper, and blue grenadier) were selected as case studies on the basis of their high to moderate vulnerability to climatic effects on species distribution and abundance. Involved stakeholders undertook a \u201cfirst pass\u201d screening assessment of options, by characterizing and then evaluating options. In the characterization step potential adaptation options for each fishery, contextualized by prior knowledge of each species\u2019 climate change exposure and sensitivity, were described using a characterization matrix. This matrix included: the specific climate vulnerability/challenges, the implications of each option on the fishery system as a whole, the temporal and spatial scales of implementation processes, and realized benefits and costs. In the evaluation step, semi-quantitative evaluation of options was undertaken by stakeholders scoring the anticipated performance of an option against a pre-determined set of criteria relating to perceived feasibility, risk (inclusive of potential costs), and benefit \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:x21FZCSn4ZoC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6393536245774684096", "cites_id": ["6393536245774684096"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00097/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wA_8U1dnulgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 7}}
