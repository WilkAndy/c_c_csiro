Here, we test for a relationship between oceanographic habitat suitability and the body condition of kingfish (Seriola lalandi) from eastern Australia. We (a) test whether individuals sampled from areas of high\u2010quality habitat were in better condition than individuals sampled from areas of low\u2010quality habitat, and (b) assess whether the condition of kingfish responded to oceanographic habitat suitability predicted at varying time\u2010before\u2010capture periods. Kingfish habitat was modelled as a function of sea surface temperature, sea\u2010level anomaly and eddy kinetic energy in a generalized additive modelling framework.
