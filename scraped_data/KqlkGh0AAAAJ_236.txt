We quantified the overlap between the foraging distribution of early incubating adults and post\u2010fledgling juveniles with management boundaries and marine reserves. We compared the extent of coverage of albatross foraging areas by Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) relative to a randomly designed network of the same size to determine whether the spatial protection measures are likely to be effective.Incubating adults consistently foraged in waters to the northwest of Tasmania while post\u2010fledglings occupied shelf waters around Tasmania and South \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1838509641091145063", "cites_id": ["1838509641091145063"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12830", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z11eGceygxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
