A first step in ensuring that the fisheries of Australia adapt effectively to climate change is an understanding of the historical and projected changes in the species captured. This information will underpin development of industry and management responses and management systems that will allow negative impacts to be mitigated and opportunities that arise to be seized. This project takes two approaches to understanding climate impacts on species that are captured in Australian fisheries - species sensitivity analysis (Part 1) and ecosystem modelling based on new climate projections (Part 2). Species level responses for each of the Commonwealth fisheries are detailed in both sections, followed by a concluding synthesis and list of recommendations (Part 3)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12920398809425735224", "cites_id": ["12920398809425735224"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/127187/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OG4zEEN6TrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
