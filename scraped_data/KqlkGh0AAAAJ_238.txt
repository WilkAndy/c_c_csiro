While fishers will autonomously adjust their activities in response to climate change, fisheries management systems may also need to be changed to facilitate adjustment. Identifying the scope of these management changes require some understanding of the impacts of climate change in the absence of any management changes. In this paper, we estimate the climate-related economic impact on Australian marine fisheries and associated sectors for the year 2030, ceteris paribus, based on expected biophysical changes to the resource and using an Input-Output model to capture impacts on the broader economy. Despite considerable uncertainties surrounding potential changes to the biological productivity of capture fisheries, the results \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11121697851395874051", "cites_id": ["11121697851395874051"], "pub_url": "https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2010007811000279", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ax2tQ0U1WJoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
