A total of 20\u201370 receivers were deployed in early December along one to three cross\u2010shelf transects and at three inshore topographic features (lumps) where SBT are known to occur; and a total of 59\u201384 juvenile SBT (41\u201390\u2003cm fork length) were tagged and released each year. After several months, receivers were recovered, and data extracted. In 2002/2003 and 2003/2004, 2\u2010yr\u2010old SBT were detected more frequently in nearshore areas than did 1\u2010yr old fish. Similarly in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007, it was the larger 1\u2010yr\u2010old SBT that were detected more frequently at inshore lumps (>85% of detections) while small 1\u2010yr\u2010old SBT were detected more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12624884750520121796", "cites_id": ["12624884750520121796"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2010.00534.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xHn_hMqZNK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
