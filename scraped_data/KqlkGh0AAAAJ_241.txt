These tools comprise both static and dynamic area\u2010based approaches to include gear limitations, closed areas and bycatch limits. There are increasing calls for additional area\u2010based interventions, particularly expansion of marine protected areas, with many now advocating closing 30% of the oceans to fishing. In this paper, we review the objectives, methods and successes of area\u2010based management of blue water fisheries across objectives related to food production and environmental, social and economic impacts. We also consider the methods used to evaluate the performance of area\u2010based regulations and provide a summary of the relative quality of evidence from alternative evaluation approaches. We found that few area\u2010based approaches have been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:l6Q3WhenKVUC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8460887809873896650", "cites_id": ["8460887809873896650"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12629", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ymT3p6Ica3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 8, "2023": 8}}
