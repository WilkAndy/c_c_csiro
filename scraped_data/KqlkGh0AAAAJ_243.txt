The Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, AUFS) is a predominantly benthic forager on the shallow continental shelf of Bass Strait, and represents the greatest biomass of marine predators in south-eastern Australia. The south-east Australian region is experiencing rapid oceanic warming, predicted to lead to substantial alterations in prey diversity, distribution and abundance. In the present study, foraging effort and indices of foraging success and efficiency were investigated in 138 adult female AUFS (970 foraging trips) during the winters of 1998\u20132019. Large scale climate conditions had a strong influence on foraging effort, foraging success and efficiency. Foraging effort and foraging success were also strongly influenced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4613570684644027268", "cites_id": ["4613570684644027268"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73579-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hOtcDBiyBkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
