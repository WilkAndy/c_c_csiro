Adaptation represents one pathway by which management agencies can seek to ensure sustainability of these resources for societal well-being, particularly when based on strong scientific evidence. Here, we examined the extent of primary scientific literature that is currently available to inform climate adaption initiatives for Australian fisheries. This is achieved via a systematic literature review for 99 harvested Australian marine species, aimed at identifying primary scientific articles that reported new knowledge of climate-driven biological changes and/or socio-ecological implications. We then assessed the quantity of scientific literature against estimated relative climate sensitivity scores for each species (from a previous study), and investigated factors that may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:4e5Qn2KL_jwC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1549997343148805232", "cites_id": ["1549997343148805232"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-019-09579-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cAwvEV-yghUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 8, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
