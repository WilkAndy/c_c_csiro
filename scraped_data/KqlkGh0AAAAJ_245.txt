Declining fish stocks in combination with mounting climate pressure are likely to lead to significant and adverse socio-ecological impacts, threatening sustainability. Responding to these challenges requires modes of governance that are capable of dealing with the complexity and uncertainty associated with the world\u2019s fisheries and their ecosystems. While a range of governance frameworks exist, the concept of polycentric governance has gained prominence in the environmental sector and is posited as a key principle underpinning the resilience of complex socio-ecological systems. However, the application of polycentric governance to fisheries management has been seldom explored. To examine this prospect, we review the literature on polycentric governance to elucidate its potential value in improving the outlook for fisheries and their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:HJSXoJQnj-YC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=818263521003972121", "cites_id": ["818263521003972121"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-017-9495-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GSYaRlYOWwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 5}}
