The cross-shore behavior of the colour and turbidity fields were quantified at a number of transects around the coastline and the locations where these fields changed from coastal to oceanic signatures were identified. Results from these analyses suggest that the coastal zone can extend several hundreds of kilometers offshore. Furthermore, the seaward extent determined from these analyses was not correlated to the underlying bathymetry of the continental shelf and slope; features commonly used to define the offshore extent of coastal zones. The estimated seaward limits determined from the analyses of the remotely sensed data were compared to limited available in situ data and predictions from a numerical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15246301793607454740", "cites_id": ["15246301793607454740"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771405003033", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FJBf8rO-ldMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
