We adapted productivity\u2013susceptibility analysis (PSA) and sustainability assessment for fishing effects (SAFE) to assess the vulnerability of 173 deepwater chondrichthyans to various demersal fishing gears in the Southern Indian and South Pacific Oceans. Several species were categorized as being at high or extreme vulnerability, including some deepwater shark species in the Southern Indian Ocean that are reported to be commercially targeted. There was good concurrence between PSA and SAFE results for species categorized as being at high or extreme vulnerability by the SAFE, but as expected there was an overall greater number assessed to be as higher vulnerability using PSA due to its precautionary nature. Our results indicate probable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:cBPnxVikjH8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5874955400666395895", "cites_id": ["5874955400666395895"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/77/5/1711/5811377", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:97T7X88IiFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
