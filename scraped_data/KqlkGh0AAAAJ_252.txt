Tunas are also unique among fishes in many of their anatomical, biological, and physiological attributes (Block and Stevens 2001) which permit their extraordinary growth and reproductive rates (eg Brill 1996; Gaertner et al. 2008; Gaikov et al. 1980; Wild 1986). Tunas are, however, not a homogenous group. Rather, as described by Bernal et al.(2017) there are demonstrable species-specific differences in their physiological abilities and tolerances that allow some to make extensive vertical movements (eg Musyl et al. 2003; Lowe et al. 2000; Bernal et al. 2009; Galli et al \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6211435237306284612", "cites_id": ["6211435237306284612"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-017-9500-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RDr8UHBzM1YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
