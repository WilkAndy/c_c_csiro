Recent years have seen the rise of climate and fishery research; however, looking further into the past can inform future approaches to fishery research, management and monitoring. We assess the progress over 25 years, on the basis of a set of recommendations made at the first Australian workshop addressing climate concerns for fisheries. The nine workshop recommendations are still relevant today, and although monitoring efforts have been significant and knowledge has accumulated rapidly, implementation of management and policy responses have lagged. We suggest that this is because societal and fisher awareness of climate change have lagged, in part because climate change has not been considered the most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13296965620601300713", "cites_id": ["13296965620601300713"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf16393", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6aaFFshPiLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
