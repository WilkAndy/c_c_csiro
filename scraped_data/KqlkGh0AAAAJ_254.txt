Fisheries rely on these services and are regionally important industries for many coastal communities. With a growing population and increasing demand for seafood production, impacts from climate change that alter the productivity of marine ecosystems will have flow\u2010on implications for economic and social systems. As small coastal communities are often highly dependent on marine\u2010based activities they are also expected to experience greater impacts from changes in productivity of marine resources than their larger and/or non\u2010coastal counterparts. To assist coastal communities in evaluating their vulnerability to climate change we have developed a hybrid socio\u2010ecological vulnerability index that combines an ecocentric index \u2013 i.e \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13317598036293034332", "cites_id": ["13317598036293034332"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fog.12139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XKGvttqc0bgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
