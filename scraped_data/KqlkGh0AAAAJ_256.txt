A significant proportion of discarded fish are edible, and if high post-release mortality occurs, the practice may seem wasteful in the context of food security. There are different reasons for discarding which can be related to demand-side issues (e.g. market preferences), supply-side issues (e.g. on-board storage capacity), and management regulations (e.g. size limits). We carried out analyses to determine why discarding was occurring in a trawl fishery operating in southern Australia\u2019s Great Australian Bight. Currently up to 56% of the fishery catch may be discarded \u2013 of which a considerable portion are edible species. The economic viability of the fishery was also considered by revenue from both target species and bycatch species based on a typical vessel. Our research found there are no supply-side barriers and that discarding in this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5884035342067007217", "cites_id": ["5884035342067007217"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016578361830242X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8X6_-fdKqFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
