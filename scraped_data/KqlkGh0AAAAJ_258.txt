Seasonal and interannual changes in the strength of the LC lead to thermal differences and potential changes in food availability between tropical and temperate waters in SWA. This phenomenon could influence the habitat utilization of SBT in these summer grounds. Movement characteristics determined from SBT tagged with acoustic transmitters (N\u2003=\u2003244) using cross\u2010shelf lines of automated receivers for three summer\u2010autumn seasons (2004/2005, 2005/2006, 2006/2007) in SWA revealed interannual variability. Each year, the eastward movements of tagged fish increased as temperatures increased, and fish left the region when temperatures exceeded 20.0\u00b0C, a temperature indicative of the leading edge of the LC in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3469936288663977443", "cites_id": ["3469936288663977443"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2012.00620.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:470Nh6uwJzAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
