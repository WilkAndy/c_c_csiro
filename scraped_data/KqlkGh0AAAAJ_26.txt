Efforts to improve knowledge exchange have been hindered by a paucity of empirically-grounded guidance to help scientists and practitioners design and implement research programs that actively facilitate knowledge exchange. To address this, we evaluated the Ningaloo Research Program (NRP), which was designed to generate new scientific knowledge to support evidence-based decisions about the management of the Ningaloo Marine Park in north-western Australia. Specifically, we evaluated (1) outcomes of the NRP, including the extent to which new knowledge informed management decisions; (2) the barriers that prevented knowledge exchange among scientists and managers; (3) the key requirements for improving knowledge exchange \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC", "num_citations": 276, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13118507403851154832", "cites_id": ["13118507403851154832"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147971630696X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kEXhnfpMDrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 11, "2018": 23, "2019": 52, "2020": 54, "2021": 77, "2022": 36, "2023": 20}}
