Here we explore the global trends in marine heatwaves (MHWs), specifically onset and decline rates, two metrics which describe how quickly a MHW will emerge or disappear from a location. These rates determine the reaction window\u2014the start of a MHW event to peak MHW temperatures\u2014and the coping window\u2014time from peak temperatures to the end of an event\u2014two important time periods relevant to a marine decision-maker. We show that MHW onset and decline rates are fastest in dynamic ocean regions and that overall, the global trend in onset rate is greater than the global trend in decline rate. We map ocean regions where these rates are changing together with forecast skill from a seasonal dynamical model (ACCESS-S). This analysis highlights areas where the length of the preparation window for impending MHWs is increased by using forecasts, and areas where marine decision-makers should be prepared for rapid responses based on realtime observations as MHWs evolve. In regions such as south Africa and Kerguelen, northwest Atlantic, northwest Pacific, southwest South Atlantic and off Australian east coast where rapid median onset and decline rates are observed, there is also a positive trend in onset and decline rates i.e., MHWs are developing and declining more rapidly. This will be a concern for many decision-makers operating in these regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:PVqtIyvKoSUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7564846621743507595", "cites_id": ["7564846621743507595"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.801217/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i-hVFey7-2gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
