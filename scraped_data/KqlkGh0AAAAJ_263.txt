Given that research funding to understand adaptation is limited, rapid return on investment is critical. For Australian marine environments, climate-change impacts are well documented and adaptation opportunities have been identified across aquaculture, fisheries, conservation and tourism sectors. Here, we have evaluated the recent Australian scientific literature to determine (1) the degree to which climate-change impacts and adaptation have been addressed across sectors, and, specifically, (2) the role of a major research program instituted in 2009 to address priority climate-change questions for these sectors, namely, Australia\u2019s \u2018National Climate Change Adaptation Research Plan for Marine Biodiversity and Resources\u2019 (MNARP).
