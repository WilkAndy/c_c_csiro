Here, we consider the influence of climate on nominal abundance trends, and test for evidence of interspecific competition based on 31 yr of count data from 3 co-occurring gull species in southeastern Tasmania. The silver gull Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae and Pacific gull Larus pacificus are native, while the kelp gull L. dominicanus established in Tasmania from New Zealand in the 1950s. We applied population growth models where either growth rate or carrying capacity was a function of both large-scale climate variables and local conditions. For the kelp gull, a null model without any climate variables was selected, consistent with recent population establishment and increase. For the 2 native species, climate covariates were included, and for both, wind speed was important; for Pacific gulls, the El Ni\u00f1o \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1251726586963885300", "cites_id": ["1251726586963885300"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v511/p249-263/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9Pzk67IGXxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
