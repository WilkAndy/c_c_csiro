The quantity that links the catch to the true abundance N or biomass B available to the gear at each gear operation (shot) is called a gear efficiency Q (alias fishing power, or probability of catching a fish species). When we consider the true population size as the whole stock, this quantity is defined as catchability (q) in fisheries (Arreguin-Sanchez 1996). Estimating gear efficiency is necessary when deriving absolute abundance estimates from catch data, as well as when refining estimates of catchability in stock assessment models (Somerton et al. 1999).The traditional way to estimate gear efficiency is by field experiments and most typically for trawls. Somerton et al.(1999) categorized four techniques for studying trawl efficiency:(1) gear comparison experiments where Q is estimated as the quotient of fish density (catch per area swept) from the trawl to density estimates from a gear type believed to be completely (ie, 100%) efficient, such as visual transects from a ROV or minisub;(2) depletion experiments where Q is estimated by repeatedly trawling on a small closed population then fitting a model to the decline in cpue as a function of cumulative catch;(3) tagging experiments where Q is estimated by determining the fate of individual fish, identified with acoustic transponding tags, that were initially positioned in the trawl path; and (4) experiments focused on vertical"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7872040271065889979", "cites_id": ["7872040271065889979"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43139067/ERA_extension_to_assess_cumulative_effec20160227-3272-a4jqew.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u7xzLusaP20J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
