The separation zone greatly influences coastal ecosystems for the relatively narrow continental shelf (only 15\u201350km wide), particularly between 32\u201334\u00b0S. In this region the continental shelf has a marked shift in the seasonal temperature-salinity relationship and elevated surface nitrate concentrations. This current parallels the portion of the coast where Australia\u2019s population is concentrated and has a long history of scientific research. However, understanding of physical and biological processes driven by the EAC, particularly in linking circulation to ecosystems, is limited. In this special issue of 16 papers on the EAC, we examine the effects of climatic wind-stress forced ocean dynamics on EAC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 273, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5033990206472033938", "cites_id": ["5033990206472033938"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510002766", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kpaP62tT3EUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 10, "2013": 11, "2014": 26, "2015": 23, "2016": 22, "2017": 20, "2018": 24, "2019": 36, "2020": 29, "2021": 25, "2022": 28, "2023": 12}}
