Responses to climate\u2010driven shifts in a fishery may be constrained by existing management or institutional arrangements and technological settings. In order to understand how fisheries are responding to ocean warming, we investigate purse seine fleets targeting tropical tunas in the east Atlantic Ocean using effort and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) data from 1991 to 2017. An analysis of the spatial change in effort using a centre of gravity approach and empirical orthogonal functions is used to assess the spatiotemporal changes in effort anomalies and investigate links to SSTA. Both analyses indicate that effort shifts southward from the equator, while no clear pattern is seen northward from the equator. Random forest models show that while \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15110352010164612127", "cites_id": ["15110352010164612127"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H6z4XBjBstEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
