However, the causes and contributing factors for rescued wildlife are rarely reported, which limits development of response options to these wildlife issues. An understanding of the distribution and number of rescuers and carers in relation to injured and orphaned wildlife allows training and outreach to be targeted around specific seasonal peaks, species and causes of injury. Aims and methods We conducted an analysis of 22\u2009723 reports over 7 years to the Bonorong Wildlife Rescue Service in Tasmania, Australia, to determine the frequency of species and types of human\u2013wildlife interaction, the report distances from the central facility, and the report distribution relative to the registered rescuer and carer networks \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:QVtou7C4vgoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=446229721752579704", "cites_id": ["446229721752579704"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/WR18127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eK5IVZFTMQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
