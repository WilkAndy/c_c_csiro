Several projected changes to the world's oceans are highly relevant to pelagic fishes, including warming, changes in circulation patterns and altered pelagic foodwebs. These are likely to drive changes in species distributions, spawning and migration behaviors, early life survival and recruitment. In many marine ecosystems, climate change will result in environmental conditions which are beyond the range of variability experienced since the advent of industrialized fishing. In recent years, modeling studies have begun to project potential impacts of climate change on pelagic fishes through a variety of methods, ranging from simple correlative models to more complex mechanistic models.
