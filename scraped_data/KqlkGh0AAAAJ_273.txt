To achieve this, planners need information on how these processes vary across space and time, and how this variation relates to species of conservation interest. This study presents a new method of quantifying variability that captures both between\u2010 and within\u2010year changes in variables of interest. We applied this method to remotely\u2010sensed chlorophyll\u2010a in the Coral Sea to find five distinct regimes of variation that serve as surrogates for assemblages of species of conservation interest. We performed a gap analysis to determine protection of the regimes both internationally and nationally within Australia's network of marine reserves in the Coral Sea. We also identified key areas for protection within each regime, in terms of chlorophyll\u2010a variability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1849136245508067164", "cites_id": ["1849136245508067164"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.01450", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XM_OPp5zqRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
