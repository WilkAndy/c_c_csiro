Theory and limited observation suggest that fish schools consist of more individuals of similar size when populations are large than when they are small. The hypothesis that population size might be indicated by school structure is tested for southern bluefin tuna (SBT), a commercially important large pelagic species, which has undergone an estimated 60% reduction in juvenile biomass since 1960. Fish size data are used to determine whether there have been changes in schooling behaviour that can be used as simple indicators of abundance. During tagging studies, juvenile SBT are removed sequentially from a school, measured, tagged, and released. These sequential size measurements are used here to describe school composition from different years \u2026Dell, J. T. and Hobday, A. J. 2008.
