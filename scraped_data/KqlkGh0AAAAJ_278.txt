Like a caterpillar entering its chrysalis, marine biology is metamorphosing into something new. Leaving its empirical origins behind, the first signs of the predictive skill that characterizes sciences such as physics and chemistry are now also emerging in biology. Climate scientists and oceanographers, taking advantage of the tremendous advances in observational technology, scientific understanding, and computing power in recent years, can now make skilful forecasts of the state of the ocean seasons, years, and in some cases up to a decade into the future (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Meehl et al., 2014). Such forecasts are an exciting opportunity for marine ecologists and fisheries scientists, who finally may be able to realize the dream of predictive skill present at the very birth of their field (eg, Helland-Hansen and Nansen, 1909). The first such pioneering products have already been operational for some years now (eg, Hobday et al., 2011; Eveson et al., 2015), and a second wave of products, inspired by the successes of the first, is now building. A revolution is indeed, underway. The manuscripts collated here sample the state-of-the art in seasonal-to-decadal forecasting of marine ecosystems. Starting with the ocean itself, we look at developments in forecasting the physical and biogeochemical environment. Case studies examine both operational marine ecological forecast products and other instances where products could be developed. We then look more generally at the way that forecasts can be used and evaluated and at their relationship to climate-scale projections.
