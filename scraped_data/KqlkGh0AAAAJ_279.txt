We quantified the annual migration cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) and spatiotemporal variability in this cycle, based on a multi-decadal electronic tagging dataset. Behaviour-switching models allowed for the identification of cohesive areas of residency and classified the temporal sequence of movements within a migration cycle from austral summer foraging grounds in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) to winter foraging grounds in the Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea and back to the GAB. Although specific regions within the Indian Ocean were frequented, individuals did not always return to the same area in consecutive years. Outward migrations from the GAB were typically longer than return migrations back to the GAB. The timing of individual arrivals to the GAB, which may be driven by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15971505249534434183", "cites_id": ["15971505249534434183"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32949-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h1vJXmcvpt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
