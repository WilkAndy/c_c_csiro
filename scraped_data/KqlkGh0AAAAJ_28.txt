Primary production is critical to maintaining biodiversity and supporting fishery catches, but predicting the response of populations to primary production change is complicated by predation and competition interactions. We simulated the effects of change in primary production on diverse marine ecosystems across a wide latitudinal range in Australia using the marine food web model Ecosim. We link models of primary production of lower trophic levels (phytoplankton and benthic producers) under climate change with Ecosim to predict changes in fishery catch, fishery value, biomass of animals of conservation interest, and indicators of community composition. Under a plausible climate change scenario, primary production will increase around Australia and generally this benefits fisheries catch and value and leads to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 270, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5642393189572401629", "cites_id": ["5642393189572401629"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02046.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3dmLE7bOTU4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 27, "2012": 25, "2013": 24, "2014": 25, "2015": 24, "2016": 20, "2017": 11, "2018": 14, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 26, "2022": 25, "2023": 5}}
