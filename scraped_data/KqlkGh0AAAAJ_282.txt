Manuscript submission and peer reviewing data from journals may be indicators of productivity impacts among aquatic scientists. We tested four null hypotheses: the COVID-19 disruption has had no effect on (i) the number of submissions to journals, or (ii) the geographic region in which the corresponding author is based, nor on the peer review process in terms of (iii) acceptance rate of requests to review and (iv) time in review. We used data provided by seven leading aquatic science journals covering the period 2009\u20132020 and representing 32 756 submissions. Submission differences varied between journals and were lower than expected in March 2020, but due to increases in subsequent months, there was no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8159839709634298792", "cites_id": ["8159839709634298792"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/77/7-8/2439/5905122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qAPhtPuSPXEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
