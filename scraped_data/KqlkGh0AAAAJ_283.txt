There is some evidence to suggest that marine predators use environmental features as foraging cues at meso-scales (100-1000 km); however, the role of environmental structure at finer scales (1-100 km) is less well understood. To investigate how marine predators respond to fine-scale environmental variability, the movement patterns of 29 GPS-tagged little penguins Eudyptula minor from 3 colonies in the highly variable Storm Bay ecosystem in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia, were analysed using hidden Markov behavioural state modelling alongside high-resolution environmental data. Variability in at-sea behavioural states was observed between colonies correlating with differences in fine-scale environmental parameters. There were significant differences in trip metrics and time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8882482501564853174", "cites_id": ["8882482501564853174"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v627/p141-154/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tmtlFcbqRHsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
