In the Tasmanian southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery (SRLF), predation by octopus is known to vary spatially, assumed to be in response to different environmental and ecological conditions. However, these effects are not well understood and there is concern that changes in the system, as a result of climate change, may alter the spatial distribution and extent of octopus predation. Using fishery\u2010dependent commercial time series data (2000\u20132011), we first examined how in\u2010pot lobster mortality by octopus predation varied across fishing areas at inter\u2010 and intra\u2010annual scales. These spatial and temporal patterns were examined using dynamic regression models (DRM) using lagged variables of lobster abundance (lobster catch per unit effort, CPUE), fishing effort (potlifts) and environmental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10494340107116024339", "cites_id": ["10494340107116024339"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fog.12115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ExLJ3Llio5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
