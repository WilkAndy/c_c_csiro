Community variability was summarized for 1968\u20132008 with the first two principal components (PCs) of recruitment estimates for six fish stocks and reproductive parameters for four seabird species; regional climate was summarized for 1953\u20132008 with the first two PCs for three parameters (sea surface temperature [SST], sea surface salinity, surface nitrate) measured at two stations; and basin-scale climate variability was summarized for 1950\u20132012 with mean South Pacific SST and the first two PCs of detrended South Pacific SST. The first two biology PCs explained 45% of total community variability. The first two PCs of basin-scale SST showed abrupt shifts similar to \u201cregime\u201d behavior observed in other ocean basins, and the first PC of basin-scale SST showed significant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18026887903084576329", "cites_id": ["18026887903084576329"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661115002487", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SX4kjQlfLPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
