Here we apply a bio\u2010physical individual\u2010based model (IBM) which couples data from a high\u2010resolution oceanographic model with temperature\u2010related survival characteristics for the early life stage of a temperate marine fish. The IBM was run retrospectively for the years 1993\u20132007 with spawning locations occurring around Tasmania, Australia. Meso\u2010scale oceanographic features led to individuals spawned on the west coast, and to a lesser extent the south coast, being washed ashore prior to achieving a competent size to actively influence their migratory paths. Individuals spawned on the east coast had significantly higher survival rates. Temperature\u2010induced mortality was relatively consistent across years.
