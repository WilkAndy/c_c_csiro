Seasonal forecasts from dynamical ocean-atmosphere models of high risk conditions in marine ecosystems can be very useful tools for managers, allowing for proactive management responses on a range of timescales. Applications include coral bleaching risk predictions and forecasts of ocean conditions driving fisheries.Real-time forecasts for coral bleaching risk on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are currently produced operationally using the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s seasonal forecast model POAMA. These forecasts provide an early warning of potential bleaching risk prior to summer, which allows reef managers to both focus monitoring programs and implement strategies to minimise bleaching damage, as well as brief stakeholders. Additionally, probabilistic forecasts provide information as to the likelihood of a bleaching event occurring, which is very useful for management in planning responses and focusing resources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11145262150858171123", "cites_id": ["11145262150858171123"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Claire-Spillman/publication/259783031_Using_dynamical_seasonal_forecasts_in_marine_management/links/0deec53cdcd2679828000000/Using-dynamical-seasonal-forecasts-in-marine-management.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8-KBRuDsq5oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
