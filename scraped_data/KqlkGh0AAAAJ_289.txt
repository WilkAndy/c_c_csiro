For the tags released in 2004-2005, not a single fish has shown movements into the Tasman Sea (ie waters east of 140 E) during the winter period. This contrasts with the results from the 1990s, in which~ 20% of the recovered tags moved into the Tasman Sea. While additional returns are needed to confirm these results, they are consistent with tag return data from conventional tagging and with reported juvenile catch rates in commercial longline fisheries. Possible reasons for the apparent disappearance of eastward migrants in the recent archival tag returns are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1018933095609853788", "cites_id": ["1018933095609853788"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/system/files/resource/en/4d950ea5096fa/28.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XOe2fUD6Iw4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
