A way to facilitate this is by knowledge exchange among marine scientists and decision-makers. While many barriers are reported in the literature, there are also examples whereby research has successfully informed marine decision-making (i.e., \u2018bright-spots\u2019). Here, we identify and analyze 25 bright-spots from a wide range of marine fields, contexts, and locations to provide insights into how to improve knowledge exchange at the interface of marine science and policy. Through qualitative surveys we investigate what initiated the bright-spots, their goals, and approaches to knowledge exchange. We also seek to identify what outcomes/impacts have been achieved, the enablers of success, and what lessons can be learnt to guide future knowledge exchange efforts. Results show that a diversity of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:7VEv-pLvLSsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15541175410263382370", "cites_id": ["15541175410263382370"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479722005679", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YtnI6LFYrdcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 5}}
