Here, we determine the extent to which Australian state fisheries management documents consider issues relating to climate change, as well as how frequently climate change is considered a research funding priority within fisheries research in Australia. We conduct a content analysis of fisheries management documents investigating categories and themes relating to Australian state fisheries, climate, and environmental change. We also reviewed recent Research Priorities from the major fisheries research funding body for reference to climate change related themes, and the number of subsequently funded projects which considered climate change or related topics. Results show that commercial state fisheries management documents consider climate only to a limited degree in comparison to other topics, with less than one-quarter of all fisheries management documents having content relating to climate. However, we find that the south-east and south-west regions of the Australian coastline have the highest incorporation of \u201cclimate\u201d and \u201cenvironmental protection considerations\u201d in their fisheries management documents, and that fisheries are more likely to have more \u201cclimate-related mentions\u201d within their related management documents, if they (i) primarily target species with higher economic commercial catch values, (ii) commercial catch weights, or (iii) a greater number of commercial fish stocks \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:U0iAMwwPxtsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10426171305666234792", "cites_id": ["10426171305666234792"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.591642/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qEmb8Y8zsZAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
