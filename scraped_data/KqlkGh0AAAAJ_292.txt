In many regions, exploitation of marine resources and climate change are two of the primary drivers shifting the abundance and distribution of marine living resources, with negative effects on marine-dependent communities. Governance systems determine \u2018who\u2019 makes decisions, \u2018what\u2019 are their powers and responsibilities, and \u2018how\u2019 they are exercised. Understanding the connections between the actors comprising governance systems and influences between governance and the environment is therefore critical to support successful transitions to novel forms of governance required to deal with environmental changes. The paper provides an analytical framework with a practical example from Vanuatu, for mapping and assessment of the governance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11597159507277815861", "cites_id": ["11597159507277815861"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18301398", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NaDWoiBj8aAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
