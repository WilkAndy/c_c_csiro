In those discussions we must, as you warn, be wary of impeding basic research. But we must be equally willing to draw lines proscribing socially pernicious applications. Germline (that is, inheritable) modification is the most socially consequential and ethically dubious application of human biotechnology; its implications have been explored from a wide range of perspectives. Most of these discussions have focused on the social meaning and repercussions of genetic manipulation of the human species, not on the moral status of human embryos. One can strongly support human-embryo research and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9948986831523516764", "cites_id": ["9948986831523516764"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/453720c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XJH_r8_mEYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2}}
