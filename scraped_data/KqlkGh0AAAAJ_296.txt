Kelp rafts form when plants become detached from the substrate. Rafts retain some of the kelp forest fauna and provide a potential transport mechanism between the isolated kelp forests. In addition, rafts are colonized by both \u201cpelagic\u201d and larval kelp forest fauna as they drift. The patterns of faunal abundance change with time spent drifting."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1593226136590267565", "cites_id": ["1593226136590267565"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/d436f81b7880fa54544889aa764f46be/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rbRU3rpGHBYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
