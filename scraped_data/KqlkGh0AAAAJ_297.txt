While there is increasing guidance on how to undertake effective knowledge exchange at the interface of science and policy, there is little information on the monetary and non-monetary costs of such endeavours. As a first step to filling this gap we undertake a narrative review of the literature and illustrate it with individual experiences from four case studies, each of which has implemented a common knowledge exchange strategy within a marine context: knowledge co-production, knowledge brokerage, boundary organisation or social connections/network. Our aim is to: (i) identify the range of costs associated with knowledge exchange activities; (ii) investigate whether the benefits \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:q1zXlPLtbUIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9657154496662245629", "cites_id": ["9657154496662245629"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569122001715", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_ZCeUtkaBYYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 6}}
