Ocean-based mitigation actions could contribute 12% of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to keep warming to less than 1.5 \u00baC but, because substantial warming is already locked in, extensive adaptation action is also needed. Here, as part of the Future Seas project, we use a \u201cforesighting/hindcasting\u201d technique to describe two scenarios for 2030 in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation for ocean systems. The \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d future is expected if current trends continue, while an alternative future could be realised if society were to effectively use available data and knowledge to push as far as possible towards \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:wyM6WWKXmoIC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14525867640405173247", "cites_id": ["14525867640405173247"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-021-09678-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_yOxWKg_lskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
