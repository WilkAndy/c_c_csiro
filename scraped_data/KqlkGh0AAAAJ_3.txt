A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 1001, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5254971289619877730", "cites_id": ["5254971289619877730"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116000057", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Yk-rvoto7UgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 14, "2017": 43, "2018": 55, "2019": 116, "2020": 120, "2021": 218, "2022": 276, "2023": 142}}
