Range edges are naturally dynamic, and shifts in the location of range edges occur at different rates and are driven by different mechanisms. This leads to challenges when seeking to generalize responses among taxa and across systems. We focus on warming-related range shifts in marine systems to describe extensions and contractions as stages. Range extensions occur as a sequence of (1) arrival, (2) population increase, and (3) persistence. By contrast, range contractions occur progressively as (1) performance decline, (2) population decrease and (3) local extinction. This stage-based framework can be broadly applied to geographic shifts in any species, life-history stage, or population subset. Ideally the probability of transitioning through progressive range shift stages \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 260, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17782340274959702004", "cites_id": ["17782340274959702004"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014000570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9FcY5EOQx_YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 7, "2015": 19, "2016": 31, "2017": 25, "2018": 35, "2019": 28, "2020": 30, "2021": 38, "2022": 35, "2023": 9}}
