These estimates are usually provided by hydrodynamic models based on which larval trajectories and survival are computed. In this study we assessed the accuracy of two hydrodynamic models around Australia \u2013 Bluelink ReANalysis (BRAN) and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) \u2013 through comparison with empirical data from the Australian National Moorings Network (ANMN). We evaluated the models\u2019 predictions of seawater parameters most relevant to larval dispersal \u2013 temperature, u and v velocities and current speed and direction - on the continental shelf where spawning and nursery areas for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12923685112858737368", "cites_id": ["12923685112858737368"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843431730585X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2PryNCMnWrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
