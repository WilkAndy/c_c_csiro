Here, we assess the potential effects of intensive salmon aquaculture on food habits, growth, and reproduction of a common predator, the spiny dogfish\u2014identified as Squalus acanthias via genetic barcoding. A total of 102 (89 females and 13 males) individuals were collected during winter and summer of 2013\u20132014 from the Chilo\u00e9 Sea where salmon aquaculture activities are concentrated. The low frequency of males in our study suggests spatial segregation of sex, while immature and mature females spatially overlapped in both seasons. Female spiny dogfish showed a functional specialist behavior as indicated by the small number of prey items and the relative high importance of the austral hake and salmon pellets in the diet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:HhcuHIWmDEUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11136917203916025305", "cites_id": ["11136917203916025305"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2957", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2e1Z6DBHjpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
