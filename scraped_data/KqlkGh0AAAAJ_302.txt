However, these characteristics also complicate their management, owing to difficulties estimating population size and sustainable harvest levels. Fishing effort data can be difficult to interpret, as the magnitude and distribution of effort are the result of multiple factors, including environmental variation and targeting different species. Yet, resolving patterns in fishing effort may provide information enabling the setting of sustainable harvest levels, the management of bycatch and the projection of potential responses to environmental change. To better understand the allocation of fishing effort, we evaluated Japanese and Taiwanese longline effort in the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans and their relationships to the environment using generalized additive models. The variables evaluated included sea surface \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=506275185832387859", "cites_id": ["506275185832387859"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fog.12123", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E2UiYpmmBgcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
