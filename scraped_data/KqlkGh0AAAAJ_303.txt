Australia has a large number of marine mammals and seabirds, particularly when Australian Antarctic and Southern Ocean species are included: 110 species of seabird and 52 species of marine mammal. These iconic species are protected throughout Australia and in some cases are recovering from previous anthropogenic impacts including harvest. The first tool we developed is a simple \u2018cost\u2010benefit\u2010 risk\u2019 (CBR) screening tool to evaluate each scenario\u2010specific adaptation option against a number of semi\u2010quantitative attributes. Awareness and identification of potentially contested options would be useful to managers charged with implementing adaptation options. Following on from specific application, testing some of the adaptation options in limited field trials would be a useful next step, further building the experience of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18240971054241383158", "cites_id": ["18240971054241383158"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118845028.ch10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9oI9bofyJP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
