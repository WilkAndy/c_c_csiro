According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), fish comprises about 20% of the animal protein in the diets of over 2.8 billion people. The contribution of fish to dietary animal protein can reach 50% in the world\u2019s poorest regions, and up to 90% in small island developing-states. Absence of property rights coupled with fisher and management perceptions that fisheries resources are infinite have seen many fisheries experience the so-called \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019(Hardin 1968). Many fish stocks have been declining, and as Brander (2013) notes full global exploitation of the most productive fish stocks probably occurred around 1990, with many fisheries now classed as over-exploited. For nearly 500 years north-east Atlantic fishing grounds, such as the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, offered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18008023989534106994", "cites_id": ["18008023989534106994"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-012-0609-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cqXkamha6fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2}}
