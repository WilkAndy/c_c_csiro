The species diversity in Australia\u2019s northern waters is very high because it is a continuation of the Indo-Pacific biodiversity hot spot. Although Australian temperate waters have lower species diversity than northern tropical waters, they harbour more endemic species due to their long history of geographic isolation (over geological time) from other temperate regions. Australian waters contain ecosystems that are of international importance, The best-known example internationally being the Great Barrier Reef.Australia\u2019s marine biodiversity underpins considerable economic wealth, for fisheries and aquaculture amounting to a gross value of $ A2. 2 billion (2007-08) annually. Marine life also provides invaluable ecosystem services including coastal defence against damaging waves and storms, processing of pollution, oxygen production and greenhouse gas regulation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13412097907415459763", "cites_id": ["13412097907415459763"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony-Richardson-2/publication/267947207_Australia%27s_Marine_Life/links/54d559e40cf25013d02b047e/Australias-Marine-Life.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sydCiPxXIboJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
