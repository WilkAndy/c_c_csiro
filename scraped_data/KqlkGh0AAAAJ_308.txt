The results of conservation research are therefore not always useful for conservation managers to apply in practice. To address this gap, this study combines qualitative methods and quantitative social network analysis to help conservation managers gain in-depth insight into social elements of marine conservation and opportunities that can help achieve conservation outcomes. Specifically, using the North West Shelf Flatback Turtle Conservation Program as a case study, our analysis shows that 1) a stakeholder\u2019s position in the turtle conservation network is not the sole or best indicator of their leadership potential to achieve conservation outcomes, 2) peripheral stakeholders are also important for trust, decision-making, and future success, 3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:qsWQJNntlusC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12327193882988100294", "cites_id": ["12327193882988100294"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/26395916.2021.1938236", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xrrfOIb9EqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
