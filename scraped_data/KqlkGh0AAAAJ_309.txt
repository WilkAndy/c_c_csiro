This species is likely extending its range via larval advection into Tasmanian coastal waters, which are occupied by the more commercially important southern rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Here, thermal tolerances of these lobster species at two life stages were investigated to assess how they may respond to warming ocean temperatures. We found that the pattern, optimum and magnitude of thermal responses differed between performance measures, life stages and species. Sagmariasus verreauxi had a warmer optimal temperature for aerobic scope and escape speed than J. edwardsii. However, J. edwardsii had a higher magnitude of escape speed, indicating higher capacity for escape performance. There were also differences between life \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Vno172sVVMwC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10460540868683747063", "cites_id": ["10460540868683747063"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-020-78052-4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:985ZbH9OK5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
