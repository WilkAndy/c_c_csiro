During this period it interacts with a year\u2010round tropical tuna longline fishery (Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery, ETBF). ETBF managers seek to minimise the bycatch of SBT by commercial ETBF longline fishers with limited or no SBT quota through spatial restrictions. Access to areas where SBT are believed to be present is restricted to fishers holding SBT quota. A temperature\u2010based SBT habitat model was developed to provide managers with an estimate of tuna distribution upon which to base their decisions about placement of management boundaries. Adult SBT temperature preferences were determined using pop\u2010up satellite archival tags. The near real\u2010time predicted location of SBT was determined by matching temperature preferences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 256, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=551663855013602138", "cites_id": ["551663855013602138"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00515.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WiOCcVrnpwcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 9, "2009": 19, "2010": 9, "2011": 23, "2012": 14, "2013": 13, "2014": 23, "2015": 19, "2016": 23, "2017": 20, "2018": 13, "2019": 16, "2020": 13, "2021": 18, "2022": 10, "2023": 7}}
