Foresighting draws on approaches used in strategic and long-range (>10 years) planning and participatory futures studies. Here, we describe a new quantitative approach to develop and rank 14 foresight scenarios across a range of general and marine-relevant science domains. Indicators for each foresight were used to assess the time-specific probability of each scenario being realized. Assessments by scientists in 2 consecutive years showed foresight scoring consistency and revealed surprises. Despite high variation among scientists in scoring the year that each indicator would occur, there was overall consistency across the foresights between years. We show that foresighting can be quantitative and that individual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9NZAP19TdFAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13385917732243926202", "cites_id": ["13385917732243926202"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332220305455", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:umwAf0FVxLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
