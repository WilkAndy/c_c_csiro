In the absence of such data, the experience of researchers can be used to inform decision making on monitoring design to detect impacts of climate change. We used expert elicitation to identify ecological traits of seabirds and marine mammals that have or were expected to respond to climate change. We analyzed the projected biological changes for five general categories of ecological traits that have been shown elsewhere to relate to climate signals: foraging and diet, body mass, breeding phenology, breeding success, and population size. Based on analysis of 106 traits in the five categories, 29 experts rated foraging- and diet-related traits to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:c1e4I3QdEKYC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15610152169550160460", "cites_id": ["15610152169550160460"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X18305399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TKLUK7FmotgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
