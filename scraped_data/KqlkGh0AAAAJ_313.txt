Here we use two systems analysis tools\u2014Ecological Risk Assessment for Effects of Fishing (ERAEF) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)\u2014over the historical development of the Australian Patagonian toothfish fishery at Heard and McDonald Islands since the start in 1997. We find that ecological risks have been systematically identified in the management process using ERAEF, and with time have been mitigated, resulting in a lower risk fishery from an ecological impact perspective. LCA inventory data from the industry shows that fuel use per kilo has increased over the history of the fishery. Our results suggest that LCA and ERAEF may provide contrasting and complementary perspectives on sustainability and reveal trade-offs when used in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16625538904937879414", "cites_id": ["16625538904937879414"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/75/6/1965/5056868", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dldCVIzHueYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
