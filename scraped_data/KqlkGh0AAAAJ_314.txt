In particular, they are present in the waters of the Great Australia Bight (GAB) over the summer months, where they are targeted by a commercial purse seine fishery. Arrival to and departure from the GAB represent important constraints on the valuable fishery, and this information is also now seen as essential for managing other activities within the GAB. As such, understanding the general patterns of the distribution of juvenile SBT and the environmental factors might be driving their distribution is valuable for establishing a baseline against which any future changes to population arrival or departure may be assessed. As part of a large investigation into the ecosystem of the GAB, data from a multi-year archival tagging program focused on juvenile SBT were used to construct \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:T_ojBgVMvoEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6472511828347631214", "cites_id": ["6472511828347631214"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064518300651", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:brYsDTf70lkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
