The project plan is to archival tag 150 to 200 juvenile SBT per year for 3 years throughout the range of habitats in which they are exploited. The project aims to provide improved knowledge of, the basis for and an understanding of the implications of the incorporating spatial dynamics and habitat utilization information directly into the analyses of conventional tag return data, CPUE standardizations using habitat based approaches, the SBT stock assessments, and the management advice. The data collected in this spatial dynamics project will be useful in estimating mixing rates and should help to provide a robust basis for interpreting the conventional tagging results. The project is intended to be complementary to the current conventional tagging program under the CCSBT Scientific Research Program, and to take advantage of this program through recovery programs and deployment opportunities. This project also builds upon previous and concurrently running archival and conventional tagging projects. In this context, the project seeks and intends to collaborate with scientists from all CCSBT members in all of its phases including the deployment, sharing of movement information, development of appropriate spatial models and in the analyses of the results. Initial collaborative arrangements have met with positive responses, and further development of these and others are anticipated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9847662926133514564", "cites_id": ["9847662926133514564"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/en/system/files/resource/en/4d9bf8c97f4da/info04.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RNH4k0HtqYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
