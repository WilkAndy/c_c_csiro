They also frequently rely on the engagement of stakeholders to positively influence program outcomes. Trust and clear communication between the managers, decision-makers, and the different stakeholders is considered key to program success.

Based on interview data, we find that trust vested in individuals (rather than in their role) across the network of people is essential.
