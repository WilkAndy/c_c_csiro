However, communicating and delivering adaption science across diverse stakeholder groups remain a significant challenge. We explore the utility of concepts from personality research to improve understanding of stakeholder capacity. Specifically, we defined eight potential climate-related personality \u2018axes\u2019 for natural resource management (NRM) organisations. We surveyed 80% of Australia\u2019s 56 regional NRM organisations to characterise their traits in relation to these axes. Through cluster analysis and trait mapping, we defined six NRM \u2018personality types\u2019. These types were unrelated to external factors such as geographic location or land use activities. Rather, five organisational personality axes were important in defining personality type \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:PkcyUWeTMh0C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10161158925257550128", "cites_id": ["10161158925257550128"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-017-1227-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MClE1jSwA40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
