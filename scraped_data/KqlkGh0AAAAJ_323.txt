It is likely to become a climate refuge for Australia in a number of contexts-it represents the southernmost refuge for a range of terrestrial and marine species and may become a residential destination for mainland \u00e9migr\u00e9s and industries displaced by significant warming or other climate change related consequences. It has a unique socio-economic profile with a limited mix of industry, a low-density dispersed population. There are also some distinct regional socio-economic, geographic and climatic differences.While the focus of the international community and national government has been on policies aimed at reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in an attempt to avoid dangerous climate change, there is now increasing recognition of the need simultaneously to adapt to the impacts of unavoidable climate change.
