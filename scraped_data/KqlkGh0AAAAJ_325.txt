Staff from NOAA Fisheries participated in the workshop as technical advisors. The purpose of the workshop was to develop recommendations on methodology for vulnerability assessments (productivity and susceptibility analyses (PSA)) that would apply to all US fisheries for use in setting annual catch limits as mandated by the Magnuson Stevens Reauthorization Act (MSRA) of 2007.The PSA Workshop participants (Andrew Rosenberg, Alejandro Acosta, Elizabeth Babcock, Jennie Harrington, Alistair Hobday, Charlotte Mogensen, Robert O\u2019Boyle, Douglas Rader, Jill Swasey, Robert Trumble and Robert Wakeford) were chosen for their expertise in fisheries science and management. They served as individuals, not representatives of any organization, and the report presented here is the consensus view of these independent experts. The Workshop members brought experience and perspectives from many fisheries around the world to the meetings held in January 2009 in Boston, with MRAG Americas, Inc. providing staff support. A number of additional participants proved invaluable during the workshop; a list of these participants is provided in Appendix B."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6157229071028617633", "cites_id": ["6157229071028617633"], "pub_url": "https://www.lenfestocean.org/~/media/legacy/lenfest/pdfs/psa_workshop_report_may_09_mrag_final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oYFeuzffclUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
