The timing of the sex change in different social situations has been a major focus of previous work. Most efforts, however, have ignored the possibility that Crepidula species may also change their social situation through movement. In this study we evaluated the situations in which movements of the Norrisia norrisi-dwelling Crepidula norrisiarum Williamson occur, and the change in reproductive potential that may result from these movements. While both sexes and a range of sizes were able to reattach following separation from the host, in a series of movement experiments only male C. norrisiarum moved on and between host N. norrisi. A female C. norrisiarum alone on a N. norrisi was the most likely social situation to attract a male, while males were least likely to move when stacked on a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2717577904819445607", "cites_id": ["2717577904819445607"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098197002189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z582wrTGtiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
