Here, we review and synthesize published reports of climate adaptation interventions for iconic fauna. We present a systematic map of peer\u2010reviewed literature databases (Web of Science and Scopus); however, only nine climate adaptation actions targeting iconic fauna were returned. In the grey and informal literature, there were many instances of practical intervention within our scope, that were not uncovered during traditional systematic search methods. The richness of actions reported in commercial news, government and non\u2010government organization media outlets and other online sources vastly outweighs the limited studies that have been robustly evaluated and reported in the scientific literature.
