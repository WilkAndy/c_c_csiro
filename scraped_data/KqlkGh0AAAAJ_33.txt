However, agrowing number of exploited taxa have declinedsubstantially and even disappeared from partsof their former range. We consider the case ofthe white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni);the first marine invertebrate proposed for theUS endangered species list. This high-valuespecies was one of five abalones targeted inthe California and Mexico fisheries; it is nowrare and protected from fishing. The biologicalcharacteristics of this deep-living abaloneindicate that it was particularly vulnerable toover-exploitation; reduction of density orgroup size is now known to lead to declines infertilization success and recruitment failure.Warning signs of potential problems existedboth pre- and post-exploitation but were notrecognized. In particular, serial depletion wasnot detected because catch was not analyzedspatially, perhaps because \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 198, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5565721637146996826", "cites_id": ["5565721637146996826"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012274101311", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WjDaLFdqPU0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 10, "2005": 13, "2006": 9, "2007": 6, "2008": 11, "2009": 5, "2010": 8, "2011": 12, "2012": 10, "2013": 20, "2014": 15, "2015": 6, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
