Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) has emerged as a rapid, nonlethal and cost-effective method for measuring fish condition and predicting proximate composition components, such as per cent fat. Measuring the condition of fish obtained from varied sources requires consideration of potential sources of error to ensure robust and comparable data are obtained. This is important when opportunistically applying BIA to assess fish condition for species that are logistically difficult to sample (e.g., large-bodied marine fishes), when different sampling methods are used, or where fish handling effects may confound condition comparisons. We experimentally tested the effects of five factors related to fish handling on an instantaneous body condition index (phase angle) measured using BIA.
