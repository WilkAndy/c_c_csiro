However, seasonal dynamical forecast models, that provide forecasts in monthly scale, often have low offshore resolution and limited information for inshore coastal areas. Hence, there is increasing demand for methods capable of fine scale seasonal forecasts covering coastal waters. Here, we have developed a method to combine observational data with dynamical forecasts from POAMA (Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia; Australian Bureau of Meteorology) in order to produce seasonal downscaled, corrected forecasts, extrapolated to include inshore regions that POAMA does not cover. We demonstrate the method in forecasting the monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) region. The resolution of POAMA in the GAB is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:PaBasH6fAo0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=841922391222351062", "cites_id": ["841922391222351062"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500316000068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1nRBQfQbrwsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
