For the second year of this experiment, it is clear that during the summer, few tagged fish from the west coast move around to the south coast (only 1 of 73 detected after two years). Age-1 SBT present in the vicitinity of the listening stations on the south coast of western Australia must arrive earlier in the season. The fraction of fish that move to the south coast is unknown, and has implications for our understanding of stock structure. Several alternate migration paths are possible, and need further consideration. Of particular importance is determining if the fraction of age-1 fish using different migration routes varies between years, and if this variation is carried forward to the fraction entering the GAB as 2-4 year old fish. At this time, a range of approaches should be considered to determine the fate of these \u201csummer resident\u201d west coast fish, including ongoing acoustic tagging, archival tagging, and biochemical analysis of older fish to determine past habitat use. This has implications for estimating juvenile recruitment and interannual variation in the fraction of 1-year old SBT that move to the Great Australia Bight in subsequent years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:lg2tdxc6qMwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1575483768387206380", "cites_id": ["1575483768387206380"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/en/system/files/resource/en/4d93d2dd3af19/44.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7Pwc3CM-3RUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
