The project has been implemented as a collaborative project between New Zealand (NZ), Taiwan and Australia. Attempt to expand the collaboration to other CCSBT members have been unsuccessful to date, but would be welcomed. The results of to date of this program are described. Archival tags have been released in NZ, Australian, central Indian Ocean and South African waters. Eighty eight tags were released in 2004, 104 in 2005, 129 in 2006, 150 in 2007 and 88 so far in 2008 1. Out of the 88 released in 2004, 25% have been recaptured so far including the first recoveries ever from archival tags released in the central Indian Ocean and New Zealand and the overall return rate for the first three years of releases is 16%. The movement patterns of the archival tags returned to date differs from those seen from the archival tagged fish released during the 1990s in the extent of their eastward and westward movements. In particular, only one of the recaptured fish from tags released in South Australia has moved into the Tasman Sea, and movement into the Indian Ocean has been restricted to the more central and eastern areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13894946951416472319", "cites_id": ["13894946951416472319"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/en/system/files/resource/en/4d93cf8179867/23.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_2ITPKLE1MAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 2}}
