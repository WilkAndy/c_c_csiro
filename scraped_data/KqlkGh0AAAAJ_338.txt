To respond to and mitigate these threats, there is a need to first systematically understand and categorise them. This paper reviewed 226 articles from the period 2010\u20132020 on threats to Australia's oceans and coasts, resulting in the identification of a total of 307 threats. Threats were grouped into three broad categories \u2014 threats from use and extraction; environmental and human-induced threats; and policy and socio-political threats \u2014then ranked by frequency. The most common \u2018threats from use and extraction\u2019 were recreational activities, non-point source pollution, and urban development; the most common \u2018environmental and human \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:T8_be82Iz5gC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5734934882568806948", "cites_id": ["5734934882568806948"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569122003076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JKKCBeSUlk8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4}}
