Successfully managing and governing marine socioecological systems in light of these compounding pressures requires approaches that move beyond reactive and business-as-usual responses. Specifically, achieving ocean health and sustainability in these socioecological systems requires strengthening and applying processes that proactively imagine alternatives and plan for preferred futures. This paper contributes to emerging dialogue on the need to co-create visions of ocean futures, with a focus on the concept of foresighting. Foresighting is a process of creatively identifying possible, plausible, alternative socioecological futures in the medium to long term, and is increasingly seen as an approach that can support decision-making under uncertainty about the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17943245358872108939", "cites_id": ["17943245358872108939"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X22000689", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i58_JZY2A_kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4}}
