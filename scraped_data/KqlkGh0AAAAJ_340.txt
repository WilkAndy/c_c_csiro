The Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, AUFS) represents the largest marine predator biomass in southeastern Australia, an oceanic region experiencing rapid warming that will impact the abundance and distribution of prey. The present study (1997\u20132020) investigated breeding phenology and pup production in AUFS on Kanowna Island, northern Bass Strait. The pupping period varied by 11 days and the median pupping date by 8 days and were negatively correlated to 1- and 2-year lagged winter zonal winds, respectively, within Bass Strait. While there was no temporal trend over the study period, annual pup production (1386\u20132574 pups) was negatively correlated to 1-year \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:cRMvf6lLvU8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17341436836667182389", "cites_id": ["17341436836667182389"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsos.211399", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nc1rkOwoqfAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
