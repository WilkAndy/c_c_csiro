One of the major challenges is being able to predict temperature-driven changes to species interactions and the outcome of these changes for marine communities due to the complex nature of indirect effects. In the ocean-warming hotspot of south-east Australia, the ranges of many species have shifted poleward. The range of the eastern rock lobster Sagmariasus verreauxi has extended into warming Tasmanian waters inhabited by the resident southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii, which may lead to increased competitive interactions between the species. Using video monitoring, we investigated how the 2 species compete for food at current (18 C), future (21 C) and future heatwave (24 C) summer temperatures. Behavioural competition occurred in 80% of experiments, during which J. edwardsii \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:rqnDXT1GswoC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2341143105268024735", "cites_id": ["2341143105268024735"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v685/p171-181/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nwXbFUBpfSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
