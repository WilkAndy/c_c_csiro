Adaptation takes place from the governance to the individual level of fishers. At the individual level, skippers make day-to-day decisions on where to fish and are at the forefront of the response to changes at sea. We seek to understand such individual adaptation in large-scale fisheries, using the case of the Spanish tropical tuna fishery. We surveyed 22% of Spanish freezer purse seine skippers operating in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. In the last 10\u2009years, more than half of skippers used new technology to search for tunas and expanded their fishing area as adaptation actions. Using cluster analysis, we identified two skipper groups\u2014based on stated behaviours to confront different hypothetical scenarios of catch decline\u2014that would follow adaptation or transformation strategies. The majority of skippers would follow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:BJtnxTr0fRcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9057046129310243483", "cites_id": ["9057046129310243483"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/79/2/532/6270967", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mxrd43cXsX0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
