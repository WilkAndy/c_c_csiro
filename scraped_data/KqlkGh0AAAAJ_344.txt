Understanding the area used by marine life is thus a key step towards the evaluation of the management framework and e cacy of a protected area. To provide information of the protective coverage of the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), we assessed the habitat utilization distribution (UD) of hammerhead and blacktip sharks in the GMR. Fifteen hammerhead sharks and 27 blacktip sharks were tagged with SPOT and SPLASH satellite tags in the north and south-central regions of the GMR between 2007 and 2012. Our results show nearly 90% of hammerhead shark\u2019s UD was enclosed by the reserve boundary during the cold season (June-October), yet this decreased to only~ 30% with the advent of the warm season (December-April). Conversely, blacktip sharks\u2019 UD was 100% enclosed by the reserve boundaries in all seasons. Season and depth were the most important environmental parameters de ning the UD of hammerhead sharks; whilst year and eddy kinetic energy were the most important parameters for blacktip sharks. These ndings suggest the size of the GMR may be effective for blacktip sharks but seasonally effective for hammerhead sharks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:I858iXPj1OkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17194132492317994730", "cites_id": ["17194132492317994730"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-124555/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6q6dQWfUne4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
