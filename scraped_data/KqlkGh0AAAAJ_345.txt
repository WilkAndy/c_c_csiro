We tested the potential for a previously overfished deep-sea shark (Centrophorus zeehaani) with very low biological productivity to recover in a network of three reserves. An individual-based simulation model was developed and applied using reproduction and movement data. Without any reserves or reductions in fishing mortality the population will never recover and will fail in 27.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 years. With three reserves, recovery from 8% of initial numbers to a target of 20% would take 63.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1\u2009years with the network in place. Length of the female cycle, natural mortality, and density dependent female dispersal are uncertain, but could delay recovery time by an additional 16.5, 98.3, or 61.9\u2009years, respectively. Effectiveness of the reserve network was particularly sensitive to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ijdKiLOsEJMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16687264595757575085", "cites_id": ["16687264595757575085"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/76/7/2318/5506076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rSsVp7wSlecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
