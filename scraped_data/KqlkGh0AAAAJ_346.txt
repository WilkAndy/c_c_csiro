Canberra: CSIRO", "abstract": "This report supplements the main report on Reef 2050 Plan Review Options. It documents the in-depth results of the gap analysis and the analysis of GBR change trajectories summarised in the main report. Details of the methods used are provided in the main report and therefore only summarised here. In essence the main approach comprised desktop reviews of published scientific journal papers, reports, and documents pertaining to deliberations of the main Reef 2050 Plan advisory bodies (RIMReP Steering Committee; Independent Expert Panel; Reef Advisory Committee).The purpose of this document is to provide access to the material that provided the base for selecting the initial review options, and for determining the scope and design of the midterm review. It also provides the background against which the review team formulated a set of recommendations in support of foundational actions that are likely need to be undertaken in preparation for a more substantive review of the Reef 2050 Plan in 2020."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6917366862558530064", "cites_id": ["6917366862558530064"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachel-Eberhard/publication/321784154_Reef_2050_plan_review_options_Appendix_volume_for_final_report_Submitted_to_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Energy/links/5a4064a5aca272d294527d10/Reef-2050-plan-review-options-Appendix-volume-for-final-report-Submitted-to-the-Department-of-the-Environment-and-Energy.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EArc_4Js_18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
