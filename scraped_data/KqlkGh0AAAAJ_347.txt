In particular, in the 2012 season, movement of SBT through the GAB was rapid, and fish were distributed further east than usual, resulting in less than 15% of purse-seine catches being taken from fishing grounds commonly used in the previous 20 years. The maximum speed that vessels towing pontoons can travel precludes rapid repositioning in response to fish movement, therefore catching vessels and tow vessels with pontoons need to be positioned in expected catch locations prior to SBT arrival. As such, rapid movements of surface schools and the presence of fish in unexpected locations make fishing operations costly and unpredictable. This project was developed in direct response to an approach from the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association (ASBTIA) and its industry representatives, who, as a result of the recently observed changes, recognized the need for scientific support to improve operational planning for ranching in the SBT purse-seine fishery.Seasonal forecasting models, such as the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s state-of-the-art Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA), deliver information regarding future environmental conditions at a timescale of weeks to months (eg Spillman and Alves 2009). Forecast variables include water temperature, rainfall and air temperature, and are considered useful up to approximately 4 months into the future, depending on the region and season of interest.
