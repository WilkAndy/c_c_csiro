Develop and promote a national framework to evaluate potential translocations of native marine species. 2. Determine the feasibility of reintroducing blue groper as a test case. 3. Design a monitoring and evaluation program to determine the effects of a trial re-introduction. 4. Reach the critical decision point on whether to re-establish blue groper in Tasmania, or take an alternative approach indicated by the research. Develop a proposal to support this outcome."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=626737100346040059", "cites_id": ["626737100346040059"], "pub_url": "http://eprints.utas.edu.au/16655/1/2010-564-DLD.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-x6veRKesggJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
