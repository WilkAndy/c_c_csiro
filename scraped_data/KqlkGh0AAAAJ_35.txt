Like all plants, phytoplankton utilise sun light, water, and dissolved CO2 and nutrients to grow and reproduce. Phytoplankton usually occur at densities of a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of cells per litre of seawater. In favourable conditions the concentration can increase to several million cells per litre which may become apparent as algal blooms.Most phytoplankton species in Australian waters belong to these major groups of planktonic algae: diatoms, dinoflagellates, small flagellates, coccolithophores and cyanophytes. Broadly speaking, these taxa differ in morphology, biochemistry, motility, sinking characteristics, competitiveness for resources, and growth rate. The surprising diversity of phytoplankton life forms in the relatively homogeneous pelagic zone reflects both the multitude of physicochemical factors they are exposed to and the various mechanisms that increase chances of survival. With current research recognising that phytoplankton species in marine Australian waters represent ecophenotypes of species known from elsewhere in the world, ie varieties that have morphological and/or physiological adaptations to local environmental conditions. The estimated number of species is on the order of several 10,000 (S. Blackburn, personal communication). General phytoplankton provinces in marine Australian waters are shown in Figure 1-1."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 193, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8158632132447386554,14539162386464454369,17116899178571153996,16393184266326940142", "cites_id": ["8158632132447386554", "14539162386464454369", "17116899178571153996", "16393184266326940142"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/hobdayaj_x2006e.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ujudu7JIOXEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 14, "2009": 20, "2010": 13, "2011": 31, "2012": 18, "2013": 14, "2014": 10, "2015": 22, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 5}}
