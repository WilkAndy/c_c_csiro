The global societal and economic impact of COVID-19 has shown that we need to assess, plan and prepare for potential future changes. These insights are particularly important for the ocean science community because of the global connectivity of the ocean and its crucial role in the Earth's climate system and in supporting all life on Earth. With climate change already impacting society and ecosystems, implementing mitigation measures to avoid and reduce emissions of greenhouses gases is an immediate priority (IPCC, 2021). Irreversible changes are already underway in the oceans and their impacts over the coming decades will continue to affect human communities, requiring societal responses and adaptation across multiple scales (IPCC, 2019, 2021).The importance of the ocean in the Earth's climate system, influencing weather patterns and affecting sea level, is now recognized by governments and increasingly so by the public. Less well-appreciated is the central role of the ocean in maintaining ecosystems and biodiversity and in supporting human systems. Approximately 680 million people live in low-lying coastal zones, and ocean and coastal economies support millions of people globally (Ebarvia, 2016; IPCC, 2019). The global economy associated with our coasts and ocean (the \u201cBlue Economy\u201d) is estimated to have an asset base of over US $24 trillion (24\u00d7 10 12) and generates at least US $2.5 trillion each year from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:gV6rEsy15s0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17575459967731485651", "cites_id": ["17575459967731485651"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.760731/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:08u7zLiT6PMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
