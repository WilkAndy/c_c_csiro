The level of these gases in the atmosphere has been measured directly, by analysing archived air samples, and over even longer periods, via air bubbles trapped in ice cores. 3The greenhouse gases emitted by human activities and natural sources trap heat in the atmosphere. In the past, multiple-millennium cycles of cooling and warming (called glacial\u2013interglacial cycles) are evident from the analysis of ice cores, which reveal that atmospheric carbon dioxide rose and fell with warming and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kUhpeDhEZMUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6109282316220772327", "cites_id": ["6109282316220772327"], "pub_url": "https://www.elgaronline.com/display/edcoll/9781788112222/9781788112222.00007.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5y_q8uWHyFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
