Since its arrival, destructive grazing by the urchin has led to widespread formation of sea urchin \u2018barrens\u2019. The loss of habitat, biodiversity and productivity for important commercial reef species in conjunction with the development of an urchin fishery has led to conflicting objectives among stakeholders, which poses complex challenges for regional management. Stakeholder representatives and managers were engaged via a participatory workshop and subsequent one-onone surveys to trial a structured decision-making process to identify effective ecosystem-based management strategies. We directly and indirectly elicited each stakeholder\u2019s preferences for nine alternative management strategies by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2907233541491288517", "cites_id": ["2907233541491288517"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/48701700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xWmwt4CRWCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
