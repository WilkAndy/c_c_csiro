In their recent paper, Gjelland & Hedger (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2017) suggest that the general detection probability model proposed by Gjelland & Hedger (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2013, 4, 665\u2013674) was not appropriately used in Huveneers et al. (Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2016, 7, 825\u2013835). The intent of the comparison in Huveneers et al. (2016) was to evaluate the Acoustic Propagation Model (APM) in a situation when parameterisation is not logistically feasible. This can be the case when reference tags have not been deployed, or when the distance between tagged animals and receivers cannot be accurately estimated or cannot be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5471122643009332463", "cites_id": ["5471122643009332463"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12806", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7-Qqew5V7UsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
