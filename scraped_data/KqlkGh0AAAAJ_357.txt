This shift reflects a sea change in ecosystem science and policy that increasingly values the services that flow from ecosystems. This chapter addresses examples of critical climate impacts on ecosystems, and also highlights how these may compromise the opportunities that ecosystems provide for societal resilience and adaptation to climate change. It suggests several broad research areas that might be followed in the near future to advance ecosystem adaptation planning, execution and evaluation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3789613418386835549", "cites_id": ["3789613418386835549"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118529577.ch24", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XUgAZ1NplzQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
