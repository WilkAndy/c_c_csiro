These pressures include coastal development, fisheries, tourism, marine pollution, and increased terrestrial pollutant runoff. Climate change will exacerbate the effects of many of these uses and society will need to adjust conventional management and governance practices to accommodate those greater effects. Responding to climate change requires two platforms: mitigation of impact, through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and adaptation to climate change while mitigation gradually occurs. Some of the considerations regarding adaptation options for the natural marine environment are described here. While a range of stakeholders must also adapt to these changes, the focus of this report card is on adaptation options to assist species to cope with climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4237249282966806399", "cites_id": ["4237249282966806399"], "pub_url": "http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/11300/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:f98D4MW7zToJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
