However, unanticipated economic and social outcomes are also apparent, particularly for small-scale fishers. In December 2020, the Australian Senate initiated an Inquiry into the operations of ITQ management systems in Australian fisheries. Submissions were made by individual fishers, industry organisations, fisheries managers, research groups and others, detailing their perceptions on performance in terms of environmental, social and economic outcomes. We summarise the key points raised in the submissions, identifying areas where claims and perceptions were similar or diverse for the different groups. We find that the individual fishers who made submissions were largely negative about the impacts of ITQs in terms of all three outcome domains \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:tBlTYpvFGQIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8270661759432420964", "cites_id": ["8270661759432420964"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF21227", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZG5g5AxLx3IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
