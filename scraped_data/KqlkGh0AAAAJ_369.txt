However, knowledge of the susceptibility of benthic marine predators to environmental variability is limited. This study investigated the influence of local-scale environmental conditions and large-scale climate indices on the spatial distribution and habitat use in the benthic foraging Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus; AUFS). Female AUFS provisioning pups were instrumented with GPS or ARGOS platform terminal transmitter tags during the austral winters of 2001\u20132019 at Kanowna Island, south-eastern Australia. Individuals were most susceptible to changes in the Southern Oscillation Index that measures the strength of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, with larger foraging ranges, greater distances \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15748602335373625297", "cites_id": ["15748602335373625297"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsos.211052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0QfVZGJGjtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
