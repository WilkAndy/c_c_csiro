We modified a well-established model to assess and describe the vulnerability of the two major industries dependent on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to extreme weather events. The modification entailed distinguishing between the properties that determine exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for both the ecological and the social components of a natural resource system. We surveyed 145 commercial fishers and 62 tourism operators following a severe tropical cyclone and a major flooding event that extensively affected the region in 2011. Exposure of these industries included direct risk to life and infrastructure and indirect risk from loss of important ecosystem services. Our study found that many commercial fishers and marine-based tourism \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 176, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12110809250514138432", "cites_id": ["12110809250514138432"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-013-9651-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QPVo99g8EqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 23, "2015": 17, "2016": 17, "2017": 6, "2018": 24, "2019": 21, "2020": 17, "2021": 16, "2022": 20, "2023": 11}}
