This research investigated current and future potential for climate adaptation to be integrated into fisheries management strategies using Tasmanian commercial wild-catch fisheries as a case study, and then identified obstacles and recommendations for fisheries management to better adapt to future climate changes. We conducted qualitative interviews with fisheries stakeholders and experts to identify their perceptions of the effects of climate change on commercial wild-catch fisheries and local marine ecosystems, as well as opportunities for enhanced management in the future. The results show that climate adaptation in Tasmania fisheries management has largely been passive or incidental to date, and suggested future improvements may incorporate: (1) more or different scientific information and better \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1251879724371613255", "cites_id": ["1251879724371613255"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf21055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RxavAPqRXxEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
