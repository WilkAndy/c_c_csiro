For SBT, spawning biomass over the past decade has been estimated to be below recognized reference limits, leading to the development of a scientifically tested management procedure implemented by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) as part of its plan to rebuild the stock (Hillary et al. 2016). In the case of PBT, high market value has kept fishing pressure high and resulted in continued declines in the stock, making new management approaches particularly important (Pons et al. 2017). Thus, while some populations are recovering as a result of improved data quality and stock assessments, quota setting, and compliance, there remains a strong need to carefully manage populations to enable recovery while they are still being fished sustainably. In addition to conventional quota based management approaches, which specify how many fish can be captured by targeted fisheries, spatial management tools have a role to play in aiding recovery and in minimizing interaction with other fisheries. Although commercial fishing is still permitted on all three bluefin species, there is a recognized need to avoid unwanted interactions in some regions, for some age classes, and at particular times of year. These interactions can occur even when targeted fisheries seek other species, such as yellowfin tuna in eastern Australia (Hartog et al. 2011) and the Gulf of Mexico (GOM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:2vr6o8x5NLkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14371958348042349024", "cites_id": ["14371958348042349024"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pxKgDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA270&dq=info:4CnGvfhzc8cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=kIzB4LbUnB&sig=HSfXp8SQgnUp6jxnwNHgWJAro6I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4CnGvfhzc8cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2}}
