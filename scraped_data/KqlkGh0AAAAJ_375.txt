These challenges can make it difficult for researchers to know how to make best-use of available scientific information to inform policy makers about options for ecosystem management. A broad range of scientific tools and approaches have emerged to attempt to meet these differing needs and together these challenges and choices have stymied decision makers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6871763139502177114", "cites_id": ["6871763139502177114"], "pub_url": "https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/system/files/NERP%20Marine%20Hub%20Paper%20Approaches%20to%20Cumulative%20Risk%20and%20Impact-v4_AO-pd%20PH.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WnumzipoXV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2}}
