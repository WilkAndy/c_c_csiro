Adaptive capacity, resource dependence, local climate exposure and sensitivity were used to assess socio-economic vulnerability to climate change for three Australian coastal communities. Higher adaptive capacity in the case study communities (St Helens, Tasmania (Tas); Bowen, Queensland (Qld); Geraldton, Western Australia (WA)) was associated with larger population size while greater resource dependence, and lower human and natural capital were associated with smaller populations. Socio-economic vulnerability was strongly influenced by climate exposure and sensitivity with the moderately-sized Bowen having the highest vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation strategies that used available assets, improved adaptive capacity or reduced socio-economic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9738700304135946928", "cites_id": ["9738700304135946928"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9738700304135946928&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sAIDKlTQJocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2}}
