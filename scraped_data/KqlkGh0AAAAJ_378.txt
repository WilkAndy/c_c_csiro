The Workshop was hosted by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) as the culmination of 3.5 years of work to assess the vulnerability of Pacific fisheries and aquaculture to climate change. It also formed part of a series of climate change awareness-raising and adaptation planning workshops around the globe financed through a Japanese-funded, and FAO-implemented, project \u201cClimate Change, Fisheries and Aquaculture: Understanding the Consequences as a Basis for Planning and Implementing Suitable Responses and Adaptation Strategies\u201d(GCP/INT/253/JPN). The technical presentations and range of possible adaptations and supporting policies presented were based on SPC publications. Discussions focused on priority adaptations for economic development and government revenue, food security and sustainable livelihoods for Melanesian, Micronesian and Polynesian nations. The adaptations identified reflect the different fisheries participation rates and importance of fish to economic development and as a source of local food and income in these different regions. The Workshop discussions recommended immediate action by all PICTs to manage fisheries resources sustainably now and into the future, to establish systems to minimize impacts of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13721658270334100913", "cites_id": ["13721658270334100913"], "pub_url": "https://www.documentation.ird.fr/hor/fdi:010058314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:saWQFH8fbb4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
