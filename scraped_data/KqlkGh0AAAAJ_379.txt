Within the suite of technology and equipment available, acoustic telemetry using acoustic receivers, such as VR2Ws, has rapidly become the most common method of monitoring the presence/absence of marine organisms. This has been epitomized by both national and international tracking programs opting for passive acoustic telemetry on a continental scale. However, whereas it is well-known that environmental characteristics can affect the performance and detection range of acoustic receivers, these effects have not yet been quantified. In the present study, we deployed eight receivers at different depths within the water column and at different orientations (hydrophone up or down), while 12 transmitters were deployed at known distance (ranging 200\u2013800 m) from the receivers. Meteorological, temperature and current measurements were obtained from an oceanographic mooring and a weather station located in proximity to the deployed receivers. The receiver performance parameters (detection rate, detection efficiency, rejection coefficient, and noise quotient) between the 12 transmitters and eight receivers were monitored and analysed using the measurements obtained from the oceanographic mooring and the weather station. Receivers were deployed from December 2008 to July 2009 and detected 1,979,543 transmissions. All receiver performance parameters varied extensively during the period of deployment from 0.05\u20130.88, 0.01\u20130.36, and 1246\u201311402 for detection efficiency, rejection coefficient, and noise quotient \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1768569821534537779", "cites_id": ["1768569821534537779"], "pub_url": "http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/10955/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M8gK5eE4ixgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
