Such predictions present opportunities for improved LMR management and industry operations, as well as new research avenues in fisheries science. LMRs respond to climate variability via changes in physiology and behavior. For species and systems where climate-fisheries links are well established, forecasted LMR responses can lead to anticipatory and more effective decisions, benefitting both managers and stakeholders. Here, we provide an overview of climate prediction systems and advances in seasonal to decadal prediction of marine-resource relevant environmental variables. We then describe a range of climate-sensitive LMR decisions that can be taken at lead-times of months \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:PyEswDtIyv0C", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=144309393623272830", "cites_id": ["144309393623272830"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116301586", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fs2qAKGwAAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 9, "2018": 19, "2019": 39, "2020": 35, "2021": 29, "2022": 29, "2023": 9}}
