Average SST for the most recent 20-year period (1992-2011) was 0.68 o C warmer than the period 1910-1929. This significant change in regionally-averaged SST is of similar magnitude to the warming of Australian air temperature (+ 0.74 o C) and to globally-averaged land and sea temperatures (+ 0.71 o C) between the same two periods. Australian region SST for every decade from 1921-1930 through 2001-2010 has been warmer than the preceding decade. The rate of globally-averaged temperature rise has accelerated since the mid-20 th century; similarly, for Australian waters the rate of warming was 0.08 o C/decade from 1910-2011 and 0.11 o C/decade from 1950-2011. Since the first Report Card in 2009, the then warmest year (1998) for Australian region SST has been superseded by that in"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=555607464432836225", "cites_id": ["555607464432836225"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=afa56312c2ba53583d6dd16e2cab1f3ad021e33f#page=10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gR4TkAvqtQcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2}}
