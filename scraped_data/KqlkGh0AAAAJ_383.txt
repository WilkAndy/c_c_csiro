The COVID-19 pandemic was, however, novel in triggering a series of systemic shocks and disruptions to the activities and operating conditions for all Australia\u2019s commercial fisheries sectors including those of the research agencies that provide the information needed for their sustainable management. While these disruptions have a single root cause\u2014the public health impacts and containment responses to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014their transmission and effects have been varied. We examine both the impacts on Australian fisheries triggered by measures introduced by governments both internationally and domestically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, and the countermeasures \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Nufq_to8ts0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11987415327165859420", "cites_id": ["11987415327165859420"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-023-09760-z", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
