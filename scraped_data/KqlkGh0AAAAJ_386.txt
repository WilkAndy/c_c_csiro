We propose that a valuable proxy for fishing opportunity is the proportion of the year that target species are available to fishers, which can be approximated by the temporal persistence of suitable habitat in defined regions. Here, we quantify changes in temporal habitat persistence (months/year) within five eastern Australian bioregions over the period 2010\u20132060 for four coastal-pelagic fishes: bonito (Sarda australis), spotted mackerel (Scomberomorus munroi), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus). When species were analysed collectively, a significant reduction in the temporal persistence of suitable environmental habitats was evident in the most equatorward (i.e \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:AFmTUeZ1pmEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5530113137827981169", "cites_id": ["5530113137827981169"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/79/4/1083/6532052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cSf1W5novkwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
