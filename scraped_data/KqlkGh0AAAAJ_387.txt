Broad information is today sought for decision-making and by many stakeholders. Here, a framework recently developed to comprehensively report on sustainability issues relevant to fisheries, the Australian Fisheries Healthcheck, was used to compare five crustacean trawl fisheries from Australia and Europe. Indicators covered 51 different aspects of sustainability in 24 sub-categories related to ecological, economic, social and ethical, governance, and external (e.g. climate, contaminants) dimensions. We found that data availability did not vary greatly between fisheries, but the indicator outcomes did. Furthermore, while environmental sustainability has received most attention in assessments to date, the associated indicators had the least publicly available data. Another finding was that eco-certification and high performance on several \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:RMgMIBzvq-4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14434573411737468292", "cites_id": ["14434573411737468292"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/77/6/2022/5870404", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hP3oUgroUcgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
