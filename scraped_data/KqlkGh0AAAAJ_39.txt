Fish, seabirds, marine mammals, turtles, and most human users respond to this varying environment by seeking or following favorable conditions on daily, seasonal, and annual timeframes. Intrinsic inclusion of the dynamic nature of the ocean and of the interactions between dynamic human activities and marine resources in management has given rise to a new form of management, dynamic ocean management. We define dynamic ocean management (DOM) as management that changes in space and time in response to the shifting nature of the ocean and its users based on the integration of current biological, oceanographic, social, and/or economic data. We argue that DOM is a valuable complement to existing static management approaches because the human-environmental system \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 169, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6740982815248733207", "cites_id": ["6740982815248733207"], "pub_url": "https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/staev33&section=7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F9TpuyfIjF0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 20, "2016": 21, "2017": 25, "2018": 25, "2019": 17, "2020": 15, "2021": 14, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
