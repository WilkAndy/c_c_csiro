At an international level, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries directs management agencies and fisheries to reduce discards through development and implementation of technologies and operational methods, including reducing post-harvest losses and waste and improving the use of bycatch to the extent that this is consistent with responsible fisheries management practices. Australian management agencies and fisheries also seek to minimise bycatch in line with international guidelines, and specific domestic policies, objectives and community expectations.Bycatch issues can be addressed by fishers (targeting practices), the supply chain (increased utilization) and by consumers (wider purchasing habits). There are a range of issues associated with these strategies, which may impact on the portfolio of approaches to minimise wastage. Here, we examine options to utilise fish that are currently discarded to both decrease wastage and increase profitability of the Great Australian Bight Trawl Sector (GABTS)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:bVQMTfhMCi4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2753857133204995029", "cites_id": ["2753857133204995029"], "pub_url": "https://www.frdc.com.au/sites/default/files/products/2015-204-DLD.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1fvb2niqNyYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
