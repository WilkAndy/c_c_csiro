Controversies over fish farming are newsworthy and emotive, particularly when company profits and communities are at stake. Unfortunately, independent scientific evidence is often used selectively or even ignored in these debates. Science is an essential tool for managers and regulators when planning industry expansion, and Australia\u2019s aquaculture industry does have a strong research base. Fish farming can be sustainable, but only if it takes proper account of scientific research \u2013 and only if that research moves fast enough to give an up to date picture of the risks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8698898600766866667", "cites_id": ["8698898600766866667"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/114769/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6wTaSzCyuHgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
