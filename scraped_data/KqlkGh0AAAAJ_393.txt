Regions experiencing high exposure to key climate drivers, like south-east Australia, represent prime locations for assessing impacts and developing, evaluating and implementing adaptation options to cope with a changing future. Institutes within the five jurisdictions of the south-east have been proactive in establishing a formal collaborative structure (the South East Australia Program) to facilitate linkages between biophysical, socio-economic and governance domains, providing solid foundations to develop and implement adaptation options. Using rock lobster, abalone, snapper and blue grenadier fisheries as case studies, we detail how climate change may intersect with the specific management tools and structures for each fishery and use a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:TlpoogIpr_IC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7562811899991807496", "cites_id": ["7562811899991807496"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/118455/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CNYbglqB9GgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
