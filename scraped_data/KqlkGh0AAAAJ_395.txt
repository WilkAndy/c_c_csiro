ISBN", "abstract": "This guide is designed to support climate change adaptation planning by Natural Resource Management (NRM) groups. It has been designed to help evaluation, prompt practitioners about where changes to their plans might be needed, and provide additional information which can support the amendment of plans.Climate change will have a direct effect on the natural resources and human communities that are the focus of NRM groups. At the same time climate change will exacerbate the existing pressures that are managed by NRM groups and the responses of people and the environment to these pressures. NRM groups have been involved in developing NRM plans for their regions for long periods of time. These plans are strategic documents which guide their investment, activities and outreach, and are supported by a variety of other more detailed planning documents, background material and by annual investment plans. Most plans are developed to be adaptive in nature and to enable feedback on outcomes achieved and lessons learned to be taken into account in determining their way forward."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16784318470748021788", "cites_id": ["16784318470748021788"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Rissik/publication/265553575_The_NRM_Adaptation_Checklist_Supporting_climate_adaption_planning_and_decision_making_for_Regional_NRM_TeChNiCAl_guide/links/541240e20cf2788c4b3556bd/The-NRM-Adaptation-Checklist-Supporting-climate-adaption-planning-and-decision-making-for-Regional-NRM-TeChNiCAl-guide.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HKT21bjg7egJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
