Specifically, we are examining the scientific, legal and social feasibilities of managed translocation of locally extinct top predator species or likely future climate migrants, where this would benefit the receiving ecosystem in terms of enhancing resilience to climate change. As a test case, we are considering the managed translocation of the Eastern Blue Groper (EBG; Achoerodus viridis) as a means of pre-adapting coastal reefs to ongoing warming of waters off eastern Tasmania."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16696399450130540765", "cites_id": ["16696399450130540765"], "pub_url": "http://eprints.utas.edu.au/11977/1/Review-of--the--Eastern-Blue-Groper.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3egOrdaGtecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
