He re-emphasized the fact that during its synthesis phase CLIOTOP will have to answer the following question:\u201cWhat were, are, and will be the effects of global changes on the structure and dynamics of pelagic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13624756093226783375", "cites_id": ["13624756093226783375"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13624756093226783375&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jxIf0HrbFL0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1}}
