This project involved the archival tagging of juvenile (2\u20134 year old) SBT throughout their range (ie from South Africa to New Zealand) with the objective of estimating movement and mixing rates, and periods of residency in different parts of this range. The project has been implemented as a collaborative project between New Zealand (NZ), Taiwan and Australia. The results of this program to date are described. Archival tags have been released in NZ, Australian, central Indian Ocean and South African waters. A total of 559 tags were released, and to date 61 tags have been recaptured (58 reported). These recaptures include the first recoveries ever from archival tags released in the central Indian Ocean and New Zealand. The fish tagged in 2007 and 2008 have not been at liberty long enough to expect substantial numbers of returns, although the relatively low number to date for the 2007 releases is of some concern. The tag deployment phase of the project has been completed, and the main analysis phase has now commenced. The movement patterns of the archival tags returned to date differs from those seen from the archival tagged fish released during the 1990s in the extent of their eastward and westward movements. In particular, only 2 (7%) of the recaptured fish from tags released in South Australia has moved into the Tasman Sea. This compares with 28% of the recaptures from prior archival releases in the 1990s. Also, none of the recaptured fish from releases after 2000 in SA moved into the more western part of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:n3vGvpFsckwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15924127137941902269", "cites_id": ["15924127137941902269"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/ja/system/files/resource/ja/4d939fb3f37b6/esc14_38.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vVMvJ0Pd_dwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
