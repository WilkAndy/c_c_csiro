A total of seventy receivers were deployed on three cross-shelf lines and three inshore topographic features (lumps) from December to May each summer. Temperature and salinity data from a separate CTD survey were used to determine water mass composition and the relationship to tagged fish distribution. Habitat usage by fish was divided into two groups: lump-association in 2004/05 and 2006/07, and wide distribution over the continental shelf in 2005/06. The interannual differences in fish distribution were related to the presence of sub-Antarctic water. The sub-Antarctic water was observed in the subsurface layer close to the shelf edge in 2005/06, and the area had higher chlorophyll-a concentrations than the inshore area. There was also slower warming in temperature over the summer in 2005/06 compared with 2004/05 and 2006/07. These results indicated that variation in temperatures was associated with a La Nina event (2005/06). Nutrient rich sub-Antarctic water may have a strong influence on fish distribution in 2005/06, with juvenile southern bluefin tuna attracted to the regional topographic features in 2004/05 and 2006/07 when sub-Antarctic water was absent. Environmental variability may be the major cause of the changes in habitat use observed for juvenile southern bluefin tuna in SWA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:N4u4nq0IxgcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16360350331982775473", "cites_id": ["16360350331982775473"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/en/system/files/resource/en/4d93d28120445/42.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sQTHMvKjC-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
