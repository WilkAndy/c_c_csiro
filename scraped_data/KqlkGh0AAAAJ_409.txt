The CCSBT has consistently highlighted the need for a fishery-independent recruitment index for Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT). Recruitment indices are important as they can provide information about stock status some years before CPUE trends in longline fisheries can provide reliable measure of a cohorts\u2019 strength. Recent trends in longline CPUE suggest that changes in recruitment may be occurring, but interpretation of CPUE alone is ambiguous because of possible changes in selectivity. The collaborative Recruitment Monitoring Program (RMP) has been support by Australia and Japan for over 10 years; the main goal has been to develop a fishery-independent index of abundance. The indices derived from the RMP are some of the indicators considered by the CCSBT SC in assessing the stock status. Efforts are underway to improve the manner in which the RMP results (other than tagging) could be used in the analytical assessment process (eg CCSBT/0509/ForInfo 2).One of the RMP fishery-independent indices was based on an aerial survey of juvenile SBT (ages 2-4) in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) between January and March. This full scientific aerial survey ran in consistent fashion from 1993-2000. In 2001, the survey was halted due to logistical difficulties with access to trained tuna spotters and planes, and to evaluate the usefulness of the index. Since then, substantial effort has been devoted to analysis of the survey results, and showed that the index was comparable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:9DLIHnF0jcYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4029726391538387510", "cites_id": ["4029726391538387510"], "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/en/system/files/resource/en/4d955639072cf/28.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Noqpfc127DcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1}}
