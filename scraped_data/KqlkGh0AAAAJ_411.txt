Common ownership of marine resources has lead to the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 and is one reason many stocks have been fished down to unproductive levels. Another important reason is the general lack of scientific understanding of factors influencing abundances and distributions of fish. GODAE will help the fishing industry sustainably harvest fish at less cost with less ecosystem impact, but only if the products of GODAE are used appropriately. For example, if the only uptake of GODAE products was by the fishing industry, then the probable outcome would be an initial increase of yield due to greater fishing efficiency, followed by a reduction of yields as more stocks became over-exploited. That outcome is relatively straightforward to avoid for managed fisheries: factor the increases in fishing efficiency into \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13549593480215597610", "cites_id": ["13549593480215597610"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13549593480215597610&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KhIzP3vTCbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
