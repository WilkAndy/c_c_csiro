Results show that the CNN model can beat the persistence of the interannual SST variability, such that the eastern IOD (EIOD) SST variability can be forecast up to 6 months in advance. Visualizing the CNN model using a gradient weighted class activation map shows that the strong positive IOD events (cold EIOD SST anomalies) can stem from different processes: internal Indian Ocean dynamics were associated with the 1994 positive IOD, teleconnection from the equatorial Pacific was important in 1997, and cooling off the Australian coast in the southeast Indian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:qPeb-qHga9sC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9588736405628893192", "cites_id": ["9588736405628893192"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9588736405628893192&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
