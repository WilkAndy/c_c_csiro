The June 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (\u201cRio+ 20\u201d) elevated the importance of the high seas by placing them high on the international agenda. Driven by diminishing resources within national jurisdictions and improved technologies, access to the high seas is increasing, and the expanding human impact threatens marine biodiversity and challenges sustainable resource use (1, 2). While Rio+ 20 fell short of launching a new legal instrument, it did show strong political support for addressing conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in the high seas, and a new legal regime remains a possibility (3). World leaders also reaffirmed the importance of adopting ecosystem and precautionary approaches to oceans management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:SxCCDk4iOpsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2488456605916167678", "cites_id": ["2488456605916167678"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2488456605916167678&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_n2bQhnGiCIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
