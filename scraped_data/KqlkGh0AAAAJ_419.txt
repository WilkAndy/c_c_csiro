They can host fragile benthic invertebrate communities (eg, cold-water corals) that are highly vulnerable to human impacts, especially bottom trawling. Commercial fisheries on seamount features for species such as orange roughy are widespread throughout the EEZ, and hence developing a risk assessment for seamount habitat from the effects of bottom trawling has been a focus of research projects supported by both the Ministry of Fisheries and Foundation for Research, Science & Technology.An approach to ecological risk assessment widely used by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to assess Australian fisheries is the Ecological Risk Assessment for Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). This is a general assessment framework method that assesses fishing activities in three levels for their effects on five ecological components of the ecosystem: target species, by-product and bycatch (non-target) species, threatened, endangered, and protected species, habitats, and ecological communities. Australian researchers experienced in the application of ERAEF attended a small workshop held in May 2009 to evaluate the suitability of this approach to assess risk of bottom trawling on seamounts. Presentations and discussions included species and communities aspects of the ERAEF and relevant work done in New Zealand, but the focus was on the habitats component of the method, and its application to risk assessment of the orange roughy trawl fishery on seamounts of the Chatham Rise."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6183884013350334951", "cites_id": ["6183884013350334951"], "pub_url": "https://docs.niwa.co.nz/library/public/NZAEBR74.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:57H2G7-R0VUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
