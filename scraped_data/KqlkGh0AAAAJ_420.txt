A changing physical environment due to anthropogenic climate change and increased frequency of extreme events such as marine heatwaves makes past experience less valuable. This risk can be reduced by utilising seasonal forecasts that provide early warning of climate events several months ahead of time. However, to benefit from a forecast, a marine business will need to be agile to respond to changing information and response options. We define a set of seven attributes that can influence and enhance this management agility; leadership, social expectations, signal strength, system manipulation, regulatory environment, market forces, and value of the operations. The management agility of different marine businesses in fisheries \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:sJK75vZXtG0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064523000267", "cites_per_year": {}}
