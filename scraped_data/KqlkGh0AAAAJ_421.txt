This paper synthesises experiences of academics and practitioners involved in seven Australian case studies in which there have been attempts to integrate or take a broader, holistic perspective of management. The evaluative framework of Stephenson et al. (2019a) was used as a lens to explore, through workshops and a questionnaire survey, the nine key features and five anticipated stages of IM in the Gladstone Harbour Project, the Great Barrier Reef, the Northern Prawn fishery and regional development, the South-East Queensland Healthy Waterways Partnership, the Australian Oceans Policy, the New South Wales Marine Estate reforms, and progress toward Integrated Management in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:wuD5JclIwkYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964569122004410", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KIgEW7aqqegJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
