Marine ecological forecasting seeks to predict how living marine resources respond to physical variability and change, enabling proactive decision\u2010making to support climate adaptation. However, the skill of ecological forecasts is constrained by the skill of underlying models of both ocean state and species\u2010environment relationships. As a test of the skill of data\u2010driven forecasts for fisheries, we developed predictive models of catch\u2010per\u2010unit\u2010effort (CPUE) of tuna and billfish across the south\u2010west Pacific Ocean, using a 12\u2010year time series of catch data and a large ensemble climate reanalysis. Descriptors of water column structure, particularly temperature at depth and upper ocean heat content, emerged as useful predictors of CPUE across species. Enhancing forecast skill over sub\u2010seasonal to multi\u2010year timescales in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:eFf2swCANGcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fog.12636", "cites_per_year": {}}
