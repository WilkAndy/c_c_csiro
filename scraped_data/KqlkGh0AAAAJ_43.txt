Ocean temperature, for example, can change the growth rate of cultured animals, or the distribution of wild stocks. In turn these impacts may require changes in fishing or farming practices. In addition to short\u2010term environmental fluctuations, long\u2010term climate\u2010related trends are also resulting in new conditions, necessitating adjustment in fishing, farming and management approaches. Longer\u2010term climate forecasts, however, are seen as less relevant by many in the seafood sector owing to more immediate concerns. Seasonal forecasts provide insight into upcoming environmental conditions, and thus allow improved decision making. Forecasts based on dynamic ocean models are now possible and offer improved performance relative to statistical forecasts, particularly given baseline shifts in the environment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 160, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1203710350193447721", "cites_id": ["1203710350193447721"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fog.12083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KdO9my9wtBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 16, "2019": 29, "2020": 16, "2021": 27, "2022": 28, "2023": 15}}
