In the case of southern bluefin tuna (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii, there has been a long and sustained commitment to research and monitoring and the development of new techniques that improve the quality and cost effectiveness of data collection. This strategic approach has focused the science on the collection of reliable fisheries dependent data, on the development of methods for collecting fishery independent data, on improving fundamental biological knowledge, and on developing new statistical methods, with the ultimate aim of directly improving advice for management. With these foundations in place, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Extended Scientific Committee (CCSBT ESC) has been able to develop and implement (in 2011) a management procedure that provides science based global catch recommendations as a central part of the CCSBT\u2019s rebuilding plan (Hillary et al. 2016). This chapter provides an overview of the range of research that has been completed as part of this strategic program and how it directly informs the management of the fishery for SBT. We first summarize the history of the commercial fishery and then focus on the science delivered in four key areas: biology, movement and migration, recruitment monitoring, and closekin abundance estimation. We explain the motivation for each research area, how the data are used for advice on stock status and recommending catch levels through the management procedure, and future research \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Og1tA8FjbJAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pxKgDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA211&dq=info:h3-IEFczcFQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=kIzB4LbVuA&sig=dZfOZowa3kTOsBM1nNiTRbXy-58", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h3-IEFczcFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
