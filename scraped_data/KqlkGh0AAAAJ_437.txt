The idea of a publicly available set of standards or guidelines for marine fishery management agencies has been under discussion within fisheries agencies for some time and is consistent with broader directions in government policy and expectations of stakeholders and the broader community.Use of these Guidelines offers a range of benefits for Fishery Agencies including to demonstrate best practice and support continuous improvement, inform strategic planning, structural and legislative reform, harmonise or coordinate functions between jurisdictions, and build credibility and transparency with external parties, such as media and general public. The Guidelines can assist with reporting and justification of management costs including highlighting efficiencies and cost savings, development of co-management approaches by clearly describing key functions for each partner, and support external certification processes. Potential fishery and community benefits include increased support for fisheries as a result of management transparency and increased community understanding of how fisheries operate. Market benefits resulting from Agency use of the Guidelines might include information provision for consumer-facing seafood guides and seafood sourcing schemes. Finally, there may be International benefits resulting from Agency use including benchmarking Australian management relative to international management approaches and performance"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.frdc.com.au/sites/default/files/products/2015-203-DLD%20Guidance%20Document.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
