Scientists are increasingly required to balance scientific rigour with storytelling narratives that can facilitate climate change mitigation and adaptation as new communication technologies evolve. In this editorial to the research front, \u2018Climate impacts on marine system structure and function: molecules to ecosystems\u2019, a review of climate change coverage in the media since 1980 showed that climate change science had a substantial voice globally and, in particular, in countries with carbon-dependent economies. However, the effective communication of multi-scale climate change research in the media can be complicated by the complex messages, the lack of training scientists receive in communication, and the traditionally distant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Zh0EY9V9P6UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF18355", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XOqd7DJNsOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
