More energy has been trapped in the global climate system, resulting in warming of land and sea temperatures. About 30% of the extra atmospheric carbon dioxide has been absorbed by the oceans, increasing their acidity. Thermal expansion and some melting of land-based ice have caused sea level to rise. Significant climate changes have now been observed across Australia and its coastal seas. The clearest signal is the warming of air and sea temperatures and the rates of warming have accelerated since the mid-20th century. Ocean warming has been higher than the global average around Australia, especially off south-eastern Australia. Changes in Australia\u2019s hydrological regime are more difficult to differentiate from the high natural inter-annual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10897816661960999650", "cites_id": ["10897816661960999650"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/mf10272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4sKE04PSPJcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 11, "2012": 11, "2013": 13, "2014": 24, "2015": 18, "2016": 15, "2017": 14, "2018": 14, "2019": 5, "2020": 15, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
