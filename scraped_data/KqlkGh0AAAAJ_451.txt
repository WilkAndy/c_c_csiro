The project has been investigating five regional \u2018hotspots\u2019 of climate and social change, defined as fast-warming marine areas and areas experiencing social tensions as a result of change: south-east Australia, Brazil, India, South Africa, and the Mozambique Channel and Madagascar. It has focused on contributing to reducing the vulnerability of coastal communi-ties and other stakeholders dependent on marine resources to adapt to climate change and variability through an integrated and trans-disciplinary approach. It includes partici-pants from Australia, Brazil, India, Madagascar, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The research programme has been divided into five inter-linked components: ocean and climate change models, species vulnerability, social as-pects, system modelling, governance, and communication and education."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://eprints.cmfri.org.in/13647/", "cites_per_year": {}}
