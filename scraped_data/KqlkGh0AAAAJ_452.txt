Unusually warm periods can also occur in the ocean. These can last for weeks or months, killing off kelp forests and corals, and producing other significant impacts on marine ecosystems, fishing and aquaculture industries.  Yet until recently, the formation, distribution and frequency of marine heatwaves had received little research attention."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/128059/", "cites_per_year": {}}
