The project has been investigating six regionalhotspots': marine areas experiencing rapid warming. These are south-east Australia, Brazil, India, Solomon Islands, South Africa, and the Mozambique Channel and Madagascar. Rapid warming could be expected to have social, cultural and economic impacts that could affect these countries in different ways and may already be doing so. GULLS has focused on contributing to assessing and reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities and other stakeholders dependent on marine resources and to facilitate adaptation to climate change and variability through an integrated and trans-disciplinary approach. It includes participants from Australia, Brazil, India, Madagascar, New Zealand, South Africa, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFMGC33E..04C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
