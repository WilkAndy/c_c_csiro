The draft Healthcheck categories includes social, economic and governance factors not consistently included in fishery assessments to-date, alongside common biological considerations, such as stock status. A holistic picture of the sustainability of Australian fisheries is needed to inform both the general public and public and private organisations about the sustainability of Australian fisheries. If implemented, a fisheries Healthcheck portal will support transparent and efficient access to commercial fishery information such as by-catch levels or economic performance which will then serve in tandem with the Status of key Australian fish stocks reports (SAFS) as the \u2018go to\u2019source of overview information about individual fisheries. A prototype online evaluation tool provides clear information on the strengths and challenges for Australian fisheries across a range of indicators. To make this online tool operational, additional fisheries information would need to be added, and wide consultation with potential users undertaken."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aysha-Fleming-2/publication/303841114_Fishery_Status_Report_Healthcheck_for_Australian_Fisheries/links/5757b7d808ae05c1ec16d768/Fishery-Status-Report-Healthcheck-for-Australian-Fisheries.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_1h8Uaks-KIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
