Owing to a lack of natural and empirical data on the influence of phenotypic adaptation on range shifts of marine species, we provide a general conceptual model for understanding population responses to climate change that incorporates plasticity and adaptation to environmental change in marine ecosystems. We use this conceptual model to help inform where within the geographical range each mechanism will probably operate most strongly and explore the supporting evidence in species. We then expand the discussion from a single-species perspective to community-level responses and use the conceptual model to visualize and guide research into the important yet poorly understood processes of plasticity and adaptation.This \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17241321678017650792", "cites_id": ["17241321678017650792"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2018.0186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aOB7vLd6Re8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 14, "2020": 30, "2021": 39, "2022": 46, "2023": 18}}
