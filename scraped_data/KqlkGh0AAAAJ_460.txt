We developed species distribution models that describe the oceanic habitats of two pelagic fish (dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus and yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi), using 19 years of presence-only data from a recreational angler-based catch-and-release fishing program. A Poisson point process model within a generalised additive modelling (GAMM) framework was used to determine the species distributions off the east coast of Australia as a function of several oceanographic covariates. This modelling framework uses presence-only data to determine the intensity of fish (fish km-2), rather than a probability of fish presence.
