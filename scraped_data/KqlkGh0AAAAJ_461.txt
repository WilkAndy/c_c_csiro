Fifty-four key ecological features (KEFs) were identified as areas of particular value to the Australian Government over the last 8 years. These were divided into six reporting groups: areas of enhanced pelagic productivity, canyons, deep seabeds, seamounts, shelf reefs and seabeds. Ecosystem models were built for 33 KEF systems that have the strongest datasets, based on a theoretical understanding of how they function. Human pressures were identified by regional specialists and combined with the KEF models to create a set of medium-term pressure scenarios for each KEF. Between four and 25 pressure scenarios were identified for each KEF. Examples of human pressures include the strengthening of the East Australian Current and shifts in ocean upwelling due \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUOSOD34B2518B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
