Since its start in 2005, IMBeR has advanced understanding about potential marine environmental effects of global change, and the impacts and linkages to human systems at multiple scales. It is apparent that complex environmental issues and associated societal/sustainability choices operate at and across the interfaces of natural and social sciences and the humanities, and require both basic, curiosity-driven research and problem-driven, policy-relevant research. Collaborative, disciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and integrated research that addresses key ocean science issues generated by and/or impacting society is required to provide evidence-based knowledge and guidance, along with options for policy-makers, managers and marine-related communities, to help achieve sustainability of the marine realm under global change. This recognition underlies a new vision, \u201cOcean sustainability under global change for the benefit of society\u201d, to guide IMBeR research for the next decade (2016-2025). This vision recognises that the evolution of marine ecosystems (including biogeochemical cycles and human systems) is linked to natural and anthropogenic drivers and stressors, as articulated in the new IMBeR research goal to, \u201cUnderstand, quantify and compare historic and present structure and functioning of linked ocean and human systems to predict and project changes including developing scenarios and options for securing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/72128/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T0o9bsQ73SkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
