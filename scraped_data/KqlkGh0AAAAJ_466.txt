While the eventual magnitude of these climate-driven impacts remains unknown, alteration of oceanographic conditions and processes from global climate change are expected to profoundly influence ecosystems and marine mammals in the foreseeable future. As marine habitats undergo change, efforts to conserve marine mammals and manage marine ecosystems would benefit from the ability to anticipate likely responses of marine mammals to these changes. Research in this arena is in its infancy despite the critical need for methodologies to help anticipate changes in occurrence, distribution, phenology, and relative abundance of marine mammal populations so that conservation measures and ecosystem management can be developed accordingly.The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) convened a workshop in January 2016 to determine to what extent it is plausible to project climate-related changes in marine mammal distribution and relative abundance based on existing modeling practices and the current state of marine mammal science, and to identify the methodologies available and their limitations. The five workshop objectives were to:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/12089", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ugNVbrCWRngJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
