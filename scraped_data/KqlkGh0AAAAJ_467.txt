However, assessment of risks (including opportunities) from anthropogenic climate change is hampered by a lack of historical data, the inherent variability of natural systems and multiple drivers of changes. Here, we identify our current capacity to use the ocean\u2019s \u2018natural laboratories\u2019 - rapidly warming ocean regions - (Hobday and Pecl 2014) \u2013 for assessing climate change risks to inform longer-term adaptation strategies for sustainable natural resource use and management. One of the key climate challenges for our natural systems is the redistribution of species, a process generally occurring faster in these faster warming ocean regions. Using metrics derived from across ecological, social, economic and governance domains, we present a global \u2018Marine Adaptation Index\u2019 of our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/118462/", "cites_per_year": {}}
