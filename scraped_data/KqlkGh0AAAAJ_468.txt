The Marine NARP aims to identify priority research questions for climate change adaptation issues relevant to Australia\u2019s marine ecosystems. This NARP was updated in 2012 (Marine NARP 2012).A drafting team has undertaken a review of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) Marine Biodiversity and Resources National Adaptation Research Plan (NARP) priority questions. These questions were last reviewed and revised in 2012. New priority questions have been identified for the same five sector-based categories as used in the previous two NARP iterations (2010 and 2012), although categories are now ordered to reflect that without healthy and diverse marine systems, uses of the species and environment will also be diminished. Cross cutting questions are also identified, as in previous iterations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/112240/", "cites_per_year": {}}
