One requirement is description of the habitat of the species in question, and this is now possible for a range of species using data collected from electronic tags. Here we report on a spatial management approach used to limit unwanted capture of southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) in the eastern Australia longline fishery. The approach combines a habitat model conditioned with temperature preference data from 56 pop\u2010up satellite archival tags deployed on SBT, and an ocean model to produce near real\u2010time habitat predictions utilized by fishery managers during the fishing season. Three habitat types based on probability of SBT occurrence are identified in the fishing region, and spatial zoning by managers is used to regulate fisher access to these zones. This management approach has been used \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15885724068751791383", "cites_id": ["15885724068751791383"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2010.00540.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:F9XS1d9tddwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 8, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 20, "2016": 17, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 19, "2020": 18, "2021": 9, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
