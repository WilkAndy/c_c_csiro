This situation is causing a humanitarian disaster and contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Medicines are not themselves subject to sanctions, but the licensing, purchase and shipment of imported medicines have all been hit. This, combined with the potential threat of sanctions by international pharmaceutical companies and banks, has led to a shortage of specific drugs and medical facilities in Iran over the past few months, increasing drug prices by 50% and affecting more than 6 million chronically ill patients.Experience in Iraq, Cuba, Libya and the former Yugoslavia indicates that sanctions seldom meet their political objectives.
