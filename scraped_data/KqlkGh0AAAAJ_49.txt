Here we synthesize information on a series of ECEs in Australia from 2011-2017 that led to well-documented, abrupt and extensive mortality of key marine habitat-forming organisms \u2013 corals, kelps, seagrasses and mangroves \u2013 along nearly more than 45% of the continental coastline of Australia. Coral bleaching occurred across much of northern Australia due to marine heatwaves affecting different regions in 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2017, while seagrass was impacted by anomalously high rainfall events in 2011 on both east and west tropical coasts. A marine heatwave off western Australia during the 2011 La Ni\u00f1a extended into temperate and subtropical regions, causing widespread mortality of kelp forests and seagrass communities at their northern distribution limits. Mangrove forests experienced high mortality during the 2016 El Ni\u00f1o across coastal areas of northern and north-western Australia due to severe water stress driven by drought and anomalously low mean sea levels. This series of ECEs reflects a variety of different events \u2013 marine heatwaves, intense rainfall from tropical storms, and drought. Their repeated occurrence and wide extent are consistent with projections of increased frequency and intensity of ECEs, and have broad implications elsewhere because similar trends are predicted globally.
