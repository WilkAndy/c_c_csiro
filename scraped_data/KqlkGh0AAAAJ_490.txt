Both countries have extensive coastlines and marine jurisdictions with the majority of the population living adjacent to the coast (Box 1). Marine industries play important roles in sustaining the livelihoods of people in coastal rural towns. Increasing food production, minimising carbon emissions and prioritising carbon sequestration opportunities are key issues facing both countries and form the basis of this research plan. In addressing these issues India and Australia are well placed to become leaders in the development of adaptation options, and pioneers of transformational industries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://eprints.cmfri.org.in/9657/", "cites_per_year": {}}
