In south east Australia, the barrens-forming sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii-Diadematidae) has recently undergone a poleward range extension to Tasmania. The sequential southward appearance of the sea urchin, a pattern of declining age and a general reduction in abundance with increasing latitude along the eastern Tasmanian coastline is consistent with recent warming and dispersal opportunities driven by change in the behaviour of the East Australian Current (EAC). While many species have been documented to undergo range shift to eastern Tasmania, C. rodgersii is of major ecological importance as overgrazing by this species results in local losses of-150 taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds. Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large and non-linear impacts as key habitat-modifying species undergo range modification. Predicted ongoing climate change in the region will favour continued population expansion of C. rodgersii, not only as a result of atmospheric forced ocean warming, but also via ongoing intensification of the EAC driving continued poleward supply of larvae and heat. This trend demands explicit effort from managers to build resilience in this important temperate reef ecosystem."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mxjO25O6UDMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA259&dq=info:7Or3FQpD3PAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=bafOMePywe&sig=ndOGuAA9DaHnk4HDexA--YX96JE", "cites_per_year": {}}
