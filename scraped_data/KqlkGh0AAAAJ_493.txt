These discoveries have enriched the existing understanding of movement patterns established by more traditional release-recapture techniques (Graham and Roberts, 2007; Castro and Rosa, 2005; Klimley, 1996; Sims et al., 2000), in particular by uncovering the variation in individual fish behavior at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Coastal regions are where many anthropogenic pressures on marine species are greatest and where some species are most readily observed. Thus, resolving movements and behavior at appropriate spatial scales in these areas is important for understanding both these species' population dynamics and the potential impact of human activities. Satellite-linked tags in particular have provided detailed knowledge of species movements (Gifford et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 2007) and, depending on the tag, can provide location at resolutions of hundreds of kilometers to hundreds of meters (ARGOS, 2008). When equipped with additional sensors, these tags can collect and archive continuous data on swimming behavior and a range of environmental parameters. However, realizing the full value of such data in a spatial context has been difficult because of the sporadic nature of position fixes generated by animals that can only be located when they surface [eg position-only tags: satellite-linked radio transmitting (SLRT) tags] or the low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:J3LtWjKFLicC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UELNBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA255&dq=info:x6VsHAnFwb8J:scholar.google.com&ots=80h20Nlj-8&sig=-pNqOLEX0B5aqQC1XXkvCPwNKzM", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:x6VsHAnFwb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
