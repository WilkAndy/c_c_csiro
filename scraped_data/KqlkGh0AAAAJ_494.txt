Responses by marine life to both climate variability and change have been documented for low trophic levels, however, responses for Australia\u2019s iconic higher trophic level marine taxa are poorly understood, including for many conservation-dependent seabirds and marine mammals. We report initial results from a national study evaluating impacts an adaptation options. Individual time series and combined analyses show consistent responses to historical climate signals, however, improved monitoring protocols are needed to maximize detection of any climate-related demographic signals. Despite difference in sampling , the development of regional multi-species-indices of environmental change provides robust climate indicators over large regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:DIubQTN3OvUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dro.deakin.edu.au/articles/conference_contribution/Seabird_and_marine_mammal_management_options_in_the_face_of_climate_change/20978581/1", "cites_per_year": {}}
