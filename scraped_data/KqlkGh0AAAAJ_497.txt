Daniel Pauly (1995) popularized the term, which refers to fisheries management where scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct \"baseline\" population size (i.e., how abundant a fish species population was before human exploitation), and thus use a shifted baseline when evaluating unfished population size. A species that was abundant hundreds of years ago may have experienced declines over that whole period, but the population status in recent past decades is incorrectly considered as the appropriate reference point for current population management. In this way, large declines in species over long periods of time can be masked, with each human generation ignorant of previous conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ20220152348", "cites_per_year": {}}
