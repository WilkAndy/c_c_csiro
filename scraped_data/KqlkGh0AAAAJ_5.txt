Acoustic receivers have been deployed in many different environments to examine specific hypotheses regarding the movement of aquatic species. This technology provides many advantages for studying aquatic animal movement patterns, but also has limitations and provides unique difficulties for users. Study design, applications, advantages and limitations are discussed with examples from past and current studies. Data management and analysis techniques are in their infancy and few standardised techniques exist. Complications with data management and potential data analysis techniques are discussed. Examples from the literature are utilised wherever possible to provide useful references."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 708, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3324640132663984666", "cites_id": ["3324640132663984666"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF05091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GsJxAZZ-Iy4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 8, "2007": 13, "2008": 16, "2009": 32, "2010": 23, "2011": 41, "2012": 35, "2013": 64, "2014": 58, "2015": 60, "2016": 50, "2017": 57, "2018": 51, "2019": 50, "2020": 44, "2021": 52, "2022": 35, "2023": 15}}
