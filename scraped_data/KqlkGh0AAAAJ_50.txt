The paper notes the need for fisheries and aquaculture management policies to better integrate the effects of climate variability and climate change in establishing harvest levels and developing future strategies. This will enhance the resilience of marine biodiversity and the adaptive capacity of the fisheries and aquaculture industries."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5386941881853950973", "cites_id": ["5386941881853950973"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103268711", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_TuUrRlDwkoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 18, "2012": 15, "2013": 16, "2014": 19, "2015": 15, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 3}}
