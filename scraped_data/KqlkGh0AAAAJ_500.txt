Several dozen species from a range of taxa have exhibited major climate related distributional shifts in recent decades, and there have been significant climate-related changes in key fisheries. Consequently, the south east region of Australia, particularly within the East Australian Current (EAC) system found along the eastern seaboard, has been the focus of much research effort over recent years. This research effort has been, and continues to be, relevant at State, Regional and National levels with the diversity of issues examined reflected in the 27 presentations delivered at the \u2018Meeting of primary investigator's working on marine climate change projects within the eastern seaboard of south-east Australia\u2019on November 4th, 2011.The purpose of this meeting report is to provide an informal document that summarises much of the research activity currently occuring within the southeast region of Australia, and provide the contact details of key researchers, to facilitate better networking and communication between relevant researchers working in the region. Additionally, it was considered a priority to document the outcomes of the discussions held on the day."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=38e86970165afd808324a24656e7090643d964c7", "cites_per_year": {}}
