Estimates of climate change impacts in Australian fisheries and their associated probability distributions were derived from the literature and expert consultations. An Input-Output model of the Australian economy was used to determine the flow-on effects of these impacts. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken on the basis of the associated uncertainties to climate change predictions. The results present a baseline for evaluating the benefits of future climate change adaptations. The results, based upon the best available biological projections, indicate most Australian fisheries considered may in fact see economic benefit as a result of climate change by 2030. Adaptation strategies should consider minimising losses and maximizing the benefits that could be brought by climate change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/conference_proceedings_or_journals/736665459", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MlsS6O65gE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
