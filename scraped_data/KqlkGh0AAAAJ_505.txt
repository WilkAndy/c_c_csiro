The impact on and temporal responses of the biota to change are less well understood, but appear to be due to influences of climate, as well as the non-climate related past and continuing human impacts. We attempt to resolve the agents of change by examining major temporal and distributional shifts in the fish fauna and making a tentative attribution of causal factors."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/45543764/Long-term_shifts_in_abundance_and_distri20160511-10345-1tiyj1i.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:At5R5psFATEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
