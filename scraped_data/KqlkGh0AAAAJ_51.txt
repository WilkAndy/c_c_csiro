The marine fauna in the region is responding to this warming with several subtidal species showing a pole-ward range expansion. We provide the first evidence for a similar response in intertidal invertebrates, on the basis of surveys from the eastern coast of Tasmania in 2007\u20132008 that replicated a set from the 1950s. Of 29 species used in the analysis, 55% were detected further south than in the 1950s. The average minimum movement of the southern (pole-ward) range edges was 116\u2009km (range 20\u2013250\u2009km), representing a rate of \u223c29\u2009km per decade for a warming rate of 0.22\u00b0C per decade. Barnacles and gastropods showed the greatest range extensions, with one species absent from Tasmania in the 1950s, the giant rock barnacle, Austromegabalanus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14502662596471165579", "cites_id": ["14502662596471165579"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF09225", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ixICCMvOQ8kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 11, "2012": 15, "2013": 9, "2014": 16, "2015": 17, "2016": 9, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 12, "2020": 9, "2021": 11, "2022": 7}}
