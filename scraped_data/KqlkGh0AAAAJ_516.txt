The IPCC 4th Assessment Report listed 28,671 significant biological changes of which 90% were consistent with climate change. Overall, less than 0.3% of these examples were from marine systems, which may be an artefact of the distribution of global science funding, the disconnect between marine and terrestrial ecology, the way marine ecologists report research findings, limitations in the existing IPCC process and limitations of marine studies. For example, the longest marine time series are generally from commercial fisheries and are a relatively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/f86ced75f865588c5fa02f97baa5e08b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=4998669", "cites_per_year": {}}
