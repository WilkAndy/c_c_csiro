Primary producers will respond rapidly to climate change due to their small size and high population turnover (Hays et al., 2005) and already the distribution and amount of phytoplankton productivity has been altered by climate change (Behrenfeld et al., 2006; Richardson & Schoeman, 2004). Other primary producers, such as seagrass, mangroves and macro-algae will also be strongly affected by climate change. Changes in the amount and type of primary production will have strong flow-on effects throughout the ecosystem (Scheffer et al., 2005). Therefore, the impact of climate change on primary production and its effects throughout marine food webs needs to be understood to ensure robust ecosystem management to preserve biodiversity and support sustainable fishing.Here we investigate the effects of climate-driven primary production change on biodiversity and fisheries across a broad range of marine ecosystems including coastal, deep sea and open ocean environments. Twelve existing Ecopath with Ecosim models of different Australian marine ecosystems were used to investigate flow-on effects of primary production change on community composition, fishery catch and value, and abundance of species with conservation importance. We simulated different trends in the amount of primary productivity in each Ecosim model to explore how primary production change affects marine ecosystems. Additionally, we considered multiple formulations for each Ecosim model to account for ecological uncertainty.
