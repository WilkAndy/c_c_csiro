They are also heavily exploited and are currently the focus of numerous ecosystem-based management exercises. Over the past ten years there has been increasing enthusiasm for marine protected areas (MPAs) as a tool for pelagic conservation. However, there remains almost a complete absence of systematic conservation planning in the pelagic realm, both within exclusive economic zones and the high seas. Here we demonstrate the use of a decision support system to guide the implementation of MPAs that consider the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm, and propose a method for integrative planning for pelagic and benthic conservation in the Southern Benguela ecosystem. Our approach was to maximize the representation of threatened species and key fisheries species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/20385/", "cites_per_year": {}}
