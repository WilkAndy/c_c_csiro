Here I focus on ecological resilience of marine systems, defined as the amount of change or disruption required to transform a system from being maintained by one set of mutually reinforcing processes and structures to a different set. Thus, systems are more easily maintained in the same state if resilience is high, and increased resilience results in an increase in the amount of \u201cenergy\u201d required to shift the system to a different stable state (Scheffer et al. 2001).Resilience in marine systems can be eroded by human impacts that can lead, for example to elevated rates of mortality. Examples of human impacts that lower resilience include pollution, fishing, coastal development, and invasive species. Multiple stressors have been shown to lead to lowered resilience in several marine systems (Pandolfi et al. 2003, Daskalov et al. 2007). Climate change will be one major additional stressor in marine systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Okey/publication/233858845_Predicting_marine_ecosystem_impacts_of_climate_change_in_Australia/links/09e4150c79adb88179000000/Predicting-marine-ecosystem-impacts-of-climate-change-in-Australia.pdf#page=88", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Z36IpLoUZbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
