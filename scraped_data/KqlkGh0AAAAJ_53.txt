They have quantified variability among models, spurred model development, contrasted within- and among-model uncertainty, assessed model fits to historical data, and provided ensemble projections of future change under specified scenarios. Given the speed and magnitude of anthropogenic change in the marine environment and the consequent effects on food security, biodiversity, marine industries, and society, the time is ripe for similar comparisons among models of fisheries and marine ecosystems. Here, we describe the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project protocol version 1.0 (Fish-MIP v1.0), part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which is a cross-sectoral network of climate impact modellers. Given the complexity of the marine ecosystem, this class of models has substantial heterogeneity of purpose, scope, theoretical underpinning, processes considered, parameterizations, resolution (grain size), and spatial extent. This heterogeneity reflects the lack of a unified understanding of the marine ecosystem and implies that the assemblage of all models is more likely to include a greater number of relevant processes than any single model. The current Fish-MIP protocol is designed to allow these heterogeneous models to be forced with common Earth System Model (ESM) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) outputs under prescribed scenarios for historic (from the 1950s) and future (to 2100) time periods \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC", "num_citations": 128, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16318770249615087517", "cites_id": ["16318770249615087517"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1421/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nReF2xTrd-IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 17, "2020": 31, "2021": 31, "2022": 25, "2023": 7}}
