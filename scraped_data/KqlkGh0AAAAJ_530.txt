That simple line conceals a major challenge for biologists studying marine species: where are my fish and what are they doing? Beginning with conventional tagging, we began to understand that movements can occur, but knew nothing about the time between marking and recapture. Acoustic tags allowed a human to tag along behind a fish for the limits of human and boat time, but provided insight into one recently tagged animal at a time\u2013a slow way to make progress. The development of \u2018smart tags\u2019, instruments that could be carried with a fish and provide information about the behaviour of each animal, has been a breakthrough in the study of marine fish. A variety of archival tag types, including live and pop-up satellite tags, and remote acoustic monitoring technologies, now provide researchers with a rich supply of data. We have generated remarkable insights into what fish do\u2026 and we want more, perhaps before we have solved some issues with existing data. Can we design tags to collect information on conspecifics, prey fields, feeding choices? Challenges involve integration with oceanographic data to understand fish preferences, and require moving beyond \u2018overlays\u2019 of fish movement with environmental data. Despite the advances in understanding, how has the new insight translated into areas such as sustainable management? Has a marine reserve been created on the basis of home range estimation? Have fishing practises changed to avoid interactions? Has fisheries management redefined \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/81206060/asfb_2006_proceedings.pdf#page=36", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u4BvwNHiE_wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
