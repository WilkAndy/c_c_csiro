This widespread use has been advanced by national and international tracking programs that coordinate deployment of passive acoustic telemetry networks on a regional and continental scale to detect tagged animals. While it is well\u2010known that environmental conditions can affect the performance of acoustic receivers, these effects are rarely quantified despite the profound implications for tag detection and hence the ecological inferences. Here, we deployed eight receivers at different depths within the water column and at different orientations (hydrophone up or down) and 12 tags 200\u2013800 m from the receivers for 234 days to investigate how the tag detection range of acoustic receivers varied through time and under different meteorologic and oceanographic conditions. The study showed that receiver depth and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2055767014148245686", "cites_id": ["2055767014148245686"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12520", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tohFGzWNhxwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 9, "2017": 16, "2018": 18, "2019": 17, "2020": 11, "2021": 23, "2022": 19, "2023": 12}}
