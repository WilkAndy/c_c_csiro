Management objectives for each sub-component in each of the ecological components were defined. A total of 5 target, 11 bycatch/byproduct, and 11 TEP species were considered to interact directly or indirectly with the fishery. Interacting habitat units (n= 2) and community units (n= 2) were also identified in the Scoping phase.The Level 1 SICA identified one internal activity involved in scenarios that had risk scores greater than 2 (moderate or greater). These activities were: Fishing. The following components had scenarios with risk scores that require some additional analysis or management response: Target, Bycatch/Byproduct, and Communities. The following components were not considered at risk from the sub-fishery, and were eliminated from further consideration at this stage: TEP species and Habitats."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6974839970114092146&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:crzYn_-by2AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
