Management objectives for each sub-component in each of the ecological components were defined. A total of 10 target (including bait species), seven bycatch/byproduct, and 38 TEP species were considered to interact directly or indirectly with the fishery. Preliminary interacting habitat units (n= 4) and community units (n= 4) were also identified in the Scoping phase.The Level 1 SICA identified a set of five internal activities in scenarios that had risk scores greater than 2 (moderate or greater). These activities were; Fishing, Translocation of Species, Bait Collection, Discarding Catch, Navigation and Steaming. The following components had scenarios with risk scores that require some additional analysis or management response: Target species, TEP species, and Communities. The following components were not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9650028296699918790&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xjlEmZvJ64UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
