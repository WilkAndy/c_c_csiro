Using a political ecology approach as a conceptual framework, the project aims at investigating the nexus of socio-economic and environmental change, focusing on changing forest utilization, its political, social and economic root causes and its ecological consequences. Globally unique walnut-fruit forests in the region, characterized by remarkably high biodiversity, are of considerable importance for sustaining the livelihoods of the local population. These forests are now in a critical condition. The status as biodiversity-hotspot of international significance and the maintenance of their manifold landscape-ecological functions is seriously threatened. Forest utilization appears to reflect the intensified pressure on natural resources under the conditions of the transition process.\" The state of research reveals that interrelationships between the transition process and ecological change in these forests and woodlands have neither been addressed in a larger and sectoral framework nor using interdisciplinary approaches so far. There is a general lack of data on the socio-economic position of the study area within Kyrgyzstan, trans-regional economic exchange relations, local property rights and land tenure issues, external interferences and political-economic power structures. At the same time, hardly any quantitative data are available on effects of multiple uses on forest ecosystem processes, biodiversity dynamics and forest condition. In order to analyse how the transition process is linked to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:w2UhwfzvF0QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/1426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GXnRM6aRNt8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
