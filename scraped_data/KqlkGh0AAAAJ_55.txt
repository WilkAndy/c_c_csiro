Impacts of warming water on oceanic species are most likely to be detected as changes in distribution. Pelagic fishes, in particular, respond to changes in ocean temperature, and modify their distribution on seasonal and interannual timescales, and thus are likely to do so in the future. Global climate models provide insight into possible future conditions, but there is also considerable uncertainty regarding future changes because of differences in model structure and future scenarios. To address some of this uncertainty, I considered output from multiple climate models through an ensemble analysis and examined potential changes in the distribution of large pelagic fishes captured by longline fisheries on the east and west coast of Australia by the year \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9009359061924995370", "cites_id": ["9009359061924995370"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661110000571", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KmH8S1WsB30J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 15, "2012": 15, "2013": 8, "2014": 15, "2015": 15, "2016": 8, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 6}}
