Unfortunately however, tumors including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) have disadvantages such as p53 mutations and a lack of p16 INK4a and/or p14 ARF. In this study, we characterized Nutlin-3a-induced cell death in 16 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. Eight cell lines, including 6 ATL-related cell lines, had wild-type p53, and Nutlin-3a activated p53 and the cell lines underwent apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest, while 8 cell lines with mutated p53 were resistant. Interestingly, SA-\u03b2-gal staining revealed that only ATL-related cell lines with wild-type p53 exhibited cellular senescence, although they lack both p16 INK4a and p14 ARF. These results indicate that cellular senescence is an important event in p53-dependent cell death in ATL cells and is inducible without p16 INK4a and p14 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:wGzT3bKASkAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9ebd38d458bf562f6cb74d760ac3c87e354ade07", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zQvCON1Ebm8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
