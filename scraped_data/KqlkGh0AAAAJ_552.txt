Over 1000 crabs were collected in monthly surveys at three sites in water of between 10 and 20 meters depth. Size, sex, reproductive condition, carapace condition, and leg damage were recorded before crabs were individually tagged and released. Four crab aggregations were observed at one of the sites (Sand Plain). The function of these aggregations seems to be for reproduction, as a lower percentage of brooding females, and a higher percentage of males was observed than when crabs were not aggregated. A total of 564 crabs was tagged at the Pier site and the overall recapture rate was 39%. At the Pier adult females were more abundant than males, were recaptured more often (46% vs. 20%), and were also more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8721606194593223134&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3lGT-59eCXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
