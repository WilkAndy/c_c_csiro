Though NTCP is a new area of climate science and active research is taking place to increase understanding of the processes and mechanisms required to produce skillful predictions, this significant technical achievement combines advances in initialization with ensemble prediction of future climate up to a decade ahead. With a growing NTCP database, the predictability of the evolving externally-forced and internally-generated components of the climate system can now be quantified. Decision-makers in key sectors of the economy can now begin to assess the utility of these products for informing climate risk and for planning adaptation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:zzCxg_vo7cAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2023.1121626/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
