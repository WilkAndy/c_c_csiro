A recently completed research project funded by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) sought to investigate the influence of oceanographic conditions on these species\u2019 distributions.A key project result is that sub-surface ocean state variables are important in explaining the distribution of catches. Previous work has focused on surface variables such as seasurface temperature, which have historically been available in seasonal forecast models and Earth System models such as those included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). However, modelled sub-surface variables are now becoming increasingly available and have revealed their importance for predicting these target species\u2019 distributions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Gpwnp1kGG20C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/FishNews/168/FishNews168_25_Hartog.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:He7CUQ8pRRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
