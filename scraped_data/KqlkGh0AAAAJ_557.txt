It is the most variable region of the oceans on interannual to centennial time scales (McPhaden et al., 2006; Chavez et al., 2011) and this ocean variability influences climate globally (Rasmussen and Wallace, 1983). It is also the largest natural source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, supplying up to 1 petagram (Pg) of carbon annually to the atmosphere (Feely et al., 2002; Chavez et al., 1999). Changes in primary production (PP) in the tropical Pacific dominate global anomalies in PP, resulting in decreases of an order of 3 Pg carbon per year during the large 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o to increases of 2 Pg per year during La Ni\u00f1a (Chavez et al., 2011; Messie and Chavez, 2012); this interannual variability is on the same order as that observed globally by terrestrial primary producers (Field et al., 1998; Zhao and Running, 2010). The southeastern tropical Pacific supports the largest single species fishery in the world, the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens)(Chavez et al., 2008). The western and central Pacific Ocean support 60% of global commercial catches of tuna that contributes up to 40% of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for countries in the region (order of 7 billion US dollars annually). These and other living marine resources fluctuate dramatically from the resulting physical variability (Barber and Chavez, 1983; Chavez et al., 2008; Williams and Terawasi, 2013). Given the importance of the region in driving global climate variability and the significance of resources throughout the region, it is of great value to society to have a well-designed and sustained observing system \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:TesyEGJKHF4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/ocrd/273679.pdf#page=152", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7O_ZxaabEewJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
