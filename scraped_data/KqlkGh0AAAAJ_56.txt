In other ways, however, they are strikingly different, including their: age, extent, geological structure, ice stability, and foodweb structure. Both regions contain very rapidly warming areas and climate impacts have been reported, as have dramatic future projections. However, the combined effects of a changing climate on oceanographic processes and foodweb dynamics are likely to influence their future fisheries in very different ways. Differences in the life-history strategies of the key zooplankton species (Antarctic krill in the Southern Ocean and Calanus copepods in the Arctic) will likely affect future productivity of fishery species and fisheries. To explore future scenarios for each region, this paper: (i) considers differing characteristics (including geographic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16224826935213362321", "cites_id": ["16224826935213362321"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-abstract/71/7/1934/666832", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kQyVfyIqKuEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 15, "2017": 9, "2018": 13, "2019": 15, "2020": 11, "2021": 17, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
