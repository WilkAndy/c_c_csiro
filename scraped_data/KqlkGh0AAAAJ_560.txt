The project has been implemented as a collaborative project between New Zealand (NZ), Taiwan and Australia. It is our hope that the collaborative efforts will be expanded to include collaborations with other CCSBT members. The early results of this program are described, with archival tags having been released in NZ, Australian and central Indian Ocean waters. 103 tags were released in 2004 and to date 89 have been released in 2005. Out of the 103 released in 2004, 9 have been recaptured so far including the first recoveries ever from archival tags released in the central Indian Ocean. It is planned to extend archival tagging operations to other parts of the Indian Ocean and possibly off the east coast of Australia depending upon the availability of suitable tagging platforms and availability of juvenile fish. This may result in a doubling of the number of fish tagged."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/ja/system/files/resource/ja/4d952cedbfe23/30.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ryfBRBwHAXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
