In both years of the experiments, it is clear that during the summer (December onwards), few tagged fish from the west coast move around to the south coast (only 1 of 73 detected over the two years). Thus, age-1 SBT present in the vicinity of the listening stations on the south coast of western Australia must arrive earlier in the season (before December). The fraction of fish that move to the south coast is unknown, and has implications for our understanding of stock structure. Several alternate migration paths are possible, and need further consideration. Beginning in 20010/11 a cooperative two-year project between Japan and Australia will examine in more detail whether age-1 SBT population from west-coast in Western Australia move to the south coast in the austral summer or remain on the west coast. Determining the fraction of fish that utilize particular migration pathways during the migration season will also provide insight for survey approaches and improved abundance estimation. In the first year of this experiment, we acoustically tagged 146 age-1 SBT in December (n= 62, December 9-16th 2009) and January (n= 84, January 8-14th 2010) on the west (n= 82) and south coast (n= 64) of Western Australia. Movements of these tagged fish are being monitored at three cross-shelf lines of listening stations: Rottnest Island on the west coast, Chatham Island on the south-west coast, and Pt Henry on the south coast. To date (July 2010) we have recovered 15 of 43 stations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:M0leSnx2MbUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ccsbt.org/ja/system/files/resource/ja/4d92849842993/esc15_26_japanacoustictagging.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KVzFAOo4hTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
