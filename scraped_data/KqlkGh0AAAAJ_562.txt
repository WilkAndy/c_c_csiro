Seasonal forecasts from dynamical ocean-atmosphere models of ocean conditions can be very useful tools for fishery managers, allowing dynamical habitat prediction and proactive management responses. The seasonal prediction system POAMA at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology currently produces operational real-time forecasts of sea surface temperatures around Australia. These dynamical ocean forecasts are combined with a statistical habitat model (conditioned with electronic tag data) to produce SBT habitat forecast maps for the season ahead. These maps are then used by fishery managers to restrict fisher access to areas with high predicted SBT distribution.
