Some of these can be measured instantaneously (eg number of individuals or nests), while others are derived from a series of sequential counts or continuous monitoring (eg foraging duration). Obtaining comprehensive data from remote animal colonies is particularly difficult, with field-based monitoring subject to resource, logistical and disturbance challenges and traditional remote camera technologies\u2019 limitations in spatial and temporal resolution and/or sample sizes. To overcome these hurdles we have adapted a land-based highresolution robotic camera system (Gigapan) that can provide time-series of spatially and temporally extensive data.We have tested the system at a shy albatross colony in northwest Tasmania over both a short, proof of concept, five day experiment and a subsequent longer term (two month) remote deployment. This robotic camera was capable of viewing 100+ nest sites simultaneously at distances of up to 100m, with resolution fine enough to detect individual behaviours of interest such as nest abandonment, incubation shift duration and day of fledging. In addition we have also developed statistical analysis approaches and successfully implemented efficient data-handling software called \u2018time-machine\u2019."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:-DxkuPiZhfEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/T-Lynch/publication/283506792_A_high-resolution_robotic_camera_system_for_monitoring_colony-wide_seabird_nesting_behaviour/links/563c319e08ae34e98c47e6c5/A-high-resolution-robotic-camera-system-for-monitoring-colony-wide-seabird-nesting-behaviour.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0xykEha9hzsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
