Gears assessed include demersal and midwater trawl, line gears (demersal longline and dropline) and gillnet gears. The outputs of the preliminary Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) are expected to change based on refinement of the attributes used in the analysis, including through a process of expert input.The work completed includes the review of literature and fishing histories to identify the chondrichthyans that may be impacted by deep water fishing gears and a preliminary PSA for these species (based on the methods of Stobutzki et al. 2002 and Hobday et al. 2011). PSA provides an initial process to rank order the potential risk to species from the effects of fishing. This serves two purposes for the Scientific Committee:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lee-Georgeson/publication/336795997_Preliminary_ecological_risk_assessment_for_the_effects_of_demersal_and_midwater_trawl_demersal_line_dropline_and_demersal_gillnet_gears_on_deepwater_chondrichthyans_in_the_South_Pacific_Ocean/links/5db2500b92851c577ebb7c6b/Preliminary-ecological-risk-assessment-for-the-effects-of-demersal-and-midwater-trawl-demersal-line-dropline-and-demersal-gillnet-gears-on-deepwater-chondrichthyans-in-the-South-Pacific-Ocean.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SzIjU3GO-hoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
