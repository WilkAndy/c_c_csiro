Understanding of interannual to decadal climate variability and impacts on marine industries has received less attention. Predictability up to 10 years ahead may come from large scale climate modes in the ocean that can persist over these time scales. In Australia the key drivers of climate variability affecting the marine environment are the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), each has phases that are associated with different ocean circulation patterns and regional environmental variables. The roles of these drivers are illustrated with three case studies of extreme events\u2013a marine heatwave in Western Australia, a coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/ASCExtended2016/Shared%20Documents/I%20-%20Seasonal-to-decadal%20prediction%20of%20marine%20systems%20opportunities,%20approaches,%20and%20applications/ICES_2016_Abstract_Decadal%20forecasting.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
