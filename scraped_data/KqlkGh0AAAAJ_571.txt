Eddies and the strength of the East Australia Current (EAC) are emphasized by this overlay. The predicted locations of the SBT habitat from the Habitat Prediction Model are shown in Figure 2.The warm core eddy off the coast of Sydney has decreased in size since the last report (Figure 1), and has cooled to an extent that it is classified almost entirely as Core habitat (Figure 2). There is a separate cold core eddy to the north of this feature (Figure 1) and this is presenting as core habitat to the north of Sydney (Figure 2). The main jet of warm EAC water can still be seen clearly in Figure 1 and as OK habitat with a buffer margin in Figure 2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6555336596439283249&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MbbhHec7-VoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
