Range shifts in marine taxa have been described for waters around all continents, including Antarctica, and the Pacific Islands4. Distributional changes are the most commonly reported, sometimes involving shifts of 100\u2019s of km. Changes in exploited species may subsequently affect the utilization of marine resources with ramifications that range from fishers\u2019 profitability and livelihoods to food security, poverty and social cohesion5-7. Despite this importance, there are currently limitations to the detection and prediction of range shifts. Overcoming these limitations is critical for policy adaptation to manage shifting marine resources in order to enhance food security8 and minimize negative socio-economic consequences. Additionally, range shifts will not occur uniformly around the world as climate change is not impacting all areas equally. Regions where ocean warming is occurring most rapidly (marine hotspots) represent an opportunity to quickly advance our understanding of current and likely future changes.The un-replicated nature of species\u2019 range shifts renders attribution of causality notoriously difficult9. However, some 75% of marine range shifts reported in the peerreviewed literature have been polewards in direction\u2013symptomatic of broad-scale environmental changes such as those predicted under global climate change scenarios4. In light of even the most conservative future climate change projections10, coupled with the available evidence that climate change is likely responsible for shifts in many \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume20/v20_n2/pp_24-27_Yeosu_W6.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zjwzRi283A8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
