The surface currents have been added to aid the interpretation. Eddies and the strength of the East Australia Current (EAC) are emphasized by this overlay. The predicted locations of the SBT habitat from the Habitat Prediction Model are shown in Figure 2.The southward flow of the EAC has strengthened since the last report (Figure 1), and warmer water is present in the area offshore of Coffs Harbour and Sydney, as an anticlockwise eddy. This large region is classified as buffer habitat (Figure 2). Because of the tropical origin of this buffer habitat (see the currents in Figure 1), this is not likely to be suitable for SBT (as it is cooling OK habitat, in contrast to buffer habitat that can result from warming of core habitat from the south.
