Even with immediate actions to reduce greenhouse gases, there will be sustained environmental changes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider appropriate adaptations to minimise detrimental impacts for both fishes and the human populations that utilise them. Climate change will have a range of direct effects on the physiology, fitness, and survivorship of Australia\u2019s marine, estuarine and freshwater fishes, but also indirect effects via habitat degradation and changes to ecosystems. Effects will differ across populations, species and ecosystems, with some impacts being complex and causing unexpected outcomes. The range of adaptation options and necessary levels of intervention to maintain populations and ecosystem function will largely depend on the vulnerability of species and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3382879547810721390", "cites_id": ["3382879547810721390"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf11139", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bi4xhQZn8i4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 10, "2013": 13, "2014": 15, "2015": 13, "2016": 17, "2017": 13, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
