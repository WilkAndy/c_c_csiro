However, in many regions, changing environments are reducing the utility of this experience. In the Great Australian Bight, recent environmental changes have modified the summer distribution of southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii). This has affected the timing and location of fishing activity and contributed to economic impacts, at the same time as international competition is lowering value of the catch. The SBT purse-seine fishery is managed under a strict quota, so catching more fish is not an option to reduce fixed costs; instead fish must be caught more efficiently in a changing environment. Following discussion with industry stakeholders, we developed a seasonal forecast system based on a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15187626206050671296", "cites_id": ["15187626206050671296"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783615001496", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wFoQIZFJxdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 12, "2017": 10, "2018": 16, "2019": 13, "2020": 17, "2021": 13, "2022": 19, "2023": 8}}
