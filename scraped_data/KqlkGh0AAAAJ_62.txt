Estuaries in these regions are influenced by a broad range of climate drivers and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We examine observed and predicted effects of climate change on the estuaries of south-western Australia (SWA), where sustained warming and drying trends have caused dramatic declines in freshwater flows of up to 70% since the 1970s, as a case study of the impacts that might be expected in other Mediterranean regions. Current and projected impacts of climate change in SWA include progressive warming and \u2018marinisation\u2019 of estuaries; extended closure of periodically open systems; an increased frequency and severity of hypersaline conditions; enhanced water column stratification and hypoxia; and reduced flushing and greater retention of nutrients \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13963941418460018102", "cites_id": ["13963941418460018102"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-017-1264-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tnWsZ7ziycEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 17, "2020": 19, "2021": 26, "2022": 29, "2023": 10}}
