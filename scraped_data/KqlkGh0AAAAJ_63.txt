Regions where warming is most rapid will be among those to experience impacts first, will need to develop early responses to these impacts and can provide a guide for management elsewhere. We describe the research history in one such global marine hotspot\u2014south-east Australia\u2014where a number of contentions about the value of hotspots as natural laboratories have been supported, including (1) early reporting of changes (2) early documentation of impacts, and (3) earlier development and promotion of adaptation options. We illustrate a transition from single discipline impacts-focused research to an inter-disciplinary systems view of adaptation research. This transition occurred against a background of change in the political position around climate change and was facilitated by four preconditioning factors. These were: (1) early observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12440667237832011499", "cites_id": ["12440667237832011499"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-013-9325-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6y7Rd_AgpqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 16, "2015": 11, "2016": 13, "2017": 11, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
