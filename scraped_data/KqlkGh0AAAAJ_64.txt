These kelp rafts have the potential to disperse fauna among isolated kelp forests; however, the success of this dispersal mechanism will be influenced by the abundance and the dispersal paths of the rafts. The abundance of kelp rafts in the Southern California Bight (SCB) was estimated from the loss of attached plants, and by direct observation of rafts at sea. Loss of attached adult plants was highest in winter (23%) and lowest in fall (8%) at 7 sites within 2 coastal kelp beds over the period of 1988 to 1998. Raft density at sea differed among 4 cruises in the period from 1995 to 1997, and ranged from 0.78 to 6.96 km-2 (average 3.02 km-2). In the SCB these densities correspond to an instantaneous abundance of between 39000 and 348000 drifting rafts.
