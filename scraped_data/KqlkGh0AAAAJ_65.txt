To date, our understanding of the range and importance of factors limiting knowledge exchange between scientists and decision-makers is based primarily on the perceptions of decision-makers, while the perceptions of scientists have been largely overlooked. This study addresses this knowledge gap by quantitatively assessing the perceptions of scientists, represented by a sample of 78 Australian marine scientists, regarding (i) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers on a personal level, (ii) the role and importance of engaging with environmental decision-makers at the institutional level, (iii) current barriers to engaging with environmental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13361119872163722659", "cites_id": ["13361119872163722659"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X14002887", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ozW7xbs7bLkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 18, "2019": 14, "2020": 11, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 7}}
