Our aim was to determine whether the biological oceanography of the region could explain the distribution and intensity of pelagic fishery catches inside and outside the EAC at that time. The EAC fishing area was noticeably warmer, less saline and lower in nutrients than waters in the other fishing areas. The EAC waters were dominated by large diatoms, the biomass of which was significantly higher than in the seamount and offshore areas, apparently the result of a cold core eddy beneath the EAC surface filament. Over the seamount and offshore more typical Tasman Sea waters prevailed, although the presence of a relatively deeper oxygen minimum layer over the seamount suggested topographically induced mixing in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3305073140916253146", "cites_id": ["3305073140916253146"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510002833", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2nH_uIL63S0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 15, "2016": 10, "2017": 7, "2018": 13, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
