Tuna are characterized by dynamic distribution patterns that respond to climate variability and long\u2010term change. Here, we investigated the effect of environmental conditions on the worldwide distribution and relative abundance of six tuna species between 1958 and 2004 and estimated the expected end\u2010of\u2010the\u2010century changes based on a high\u2010greenhouse gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5). We created species distribution models using a long\u2010term Japanese longline fishery dataset and two\u2010step generalized additive models. Over the historical period, suitable habitats shifted poleward for 20 out of 22 tuna stocks, based on their gravity centre (GC) and/or one of their distribution limits. On average, tuna habitat distribution limits have shifted poleward 6.5 km per decade \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Ic1VZgkJnDsC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15078537947521079617", "cites_id": ["15078537947521079617"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14630", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qdk9rl-6QdEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 15, "2021": 31, "2022": 32, "2023": 17}}
