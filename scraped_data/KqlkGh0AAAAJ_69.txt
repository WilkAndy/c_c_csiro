Capture of SBT is regulated by quota, as is access to regions likely to contain SBT. A habitat prediction model combining data from an ocean model and pop-up satellite archival tags is used to define habitat zones based on the probability of SBT occurrence. These habitat zones are used by fishery managers to restrict access by ETBF fishers to SBT habitat during a May-November management season. The zones display a distinct seasonal cycle driven by the seasonal southward expansion and northward contraction of the East Australia Current (EAC) and as a result access by fishers to particular ocean regions changes seasonally. This species also overlaps with the commercially valuable yellowfin tuna (YFT), thus, we modified the SBT model to generate YFT habitat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 101, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11493292325439432066", "cites_id": ["11493292325439432066"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510002122", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gmWK1XlggJ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 15, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 16, "2016": 12, "2017": 11, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
