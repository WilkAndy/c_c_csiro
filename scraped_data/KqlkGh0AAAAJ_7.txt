The impact on and temporal responses of the biota to change are less well understood, but appear to be due to influences of climate, as well as the non\u2010climate related past and continuing human impacts. We attempt to resolve the agents of change by examining major temporal and distributional shifts in the fish fauna and making a tentative attribution of causal factors.Location\u2002 Temperate seas of south\u2010eastern Australia.Methods\u2002 Mixed data sources synthesized from published accounts, scientific surveys, spearfishing and angling competitions, commercial catches and underwater photographic records, from the \u2018late 1800s\u2019 to the \u2018present\u2019, were examined to determine shifts in coastal fish distributions.Results\u2002 Forty\u2010five species, representing 27 families (about 30% of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 552, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9174687982560205377", "cites_id": ["9174687982560205377"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00575.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QdqLTRwKU38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 27, "2012": 39, "2013": 41, "2014": 56, "2015": 44, "2016": 43, "2017": 56, "2018": 44, "2019": 44, "2020": 49, "2021": 48, "2022": 42, "2023": 11}}
