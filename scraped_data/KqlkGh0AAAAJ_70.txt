Here, mean temperatures have been rising over several decades at nearly four times the global average rate, with concomitant changes in extreme temperatures \u2013 marine heatwaves. These changes have recently caused the marine biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture industries off Tasmania\u2019s east coast to come under stress. In this study we quantify the long-term trends, variability and predictability of marine heatwaves off eastern Tasmania. We use a high-resolution ocean model for Tasmania\u2019s eastern continental shelf. The ocean state over the 1993\u20132015 period is hindcast, providing daily estimates of the three-dimensional temperature and circulation fields. Marine heatwaves are identified at the surface and subsurface from ocean temperature time series using a consistent definition. Trends in marine heatwave frequency are positive nearly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10067614429268051605", "cites_id": ["10067614429268051605"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661117303336", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lYYeoPtZt4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 20, "2020": 13, "2021": 29, "2022": 26, "2023": 6}}
