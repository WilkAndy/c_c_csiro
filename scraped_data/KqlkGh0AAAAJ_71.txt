The accurate depiction of the ocean's physical environment enabled by Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) systems, in both real-time and reanalysis modes, is already valuable for various applications, such as the fishing industry and fisheries management. However, most of these applications require accurate estimates of both physical and biogeochemical ocean conditions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we discuss recent developments that enable coupling new biogeochemical models and assimilation components with the existing GODAE systems, and we examine the potential of such systems in several areas of interest: phytoplankton biomass monitoring in the open ocean, ocean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15070952954779182160", "cites_id": ["15070952954779182160"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24861004", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UKQ88NzHJtEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 8, "2010": 5, "2011": 14, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
