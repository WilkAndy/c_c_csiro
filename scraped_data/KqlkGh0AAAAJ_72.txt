Using the Tasmanian rock lobster industry as a case study, we considered the efficacy of risk perception as a tool to inform how to communicate the science of climate change and suggestions for management in relation to development of adaptation strategies for fisheries. Fishers surveyed in this study operate in a fishery that is expected to undergo large changes as a consequence of climate change. Fishers also reported observations of similar large changes in the marine environment and lobster fishery consistent with climate change; yet most fishers surveyed expressed doubts about whether climate change was a real process. The important point for adaption of the industry to climate change is that fisher perceptions of risk tended to create barriers to acceptance of climate change as an issue. This means that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13774746752028287449", "cites_id": ["13774746752028287449"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X11001655", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2aGccTC7Kb8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 16, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 10, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
