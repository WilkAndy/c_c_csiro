Here we investigate sources of global temporal variation in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Ocean Colour (Chl-a) and their co-variation, over a 14 year period using statistical methodologies that partition sources of variation into inter-annual and annual components and explicitly account for daily auto-correlation. The variation in SST shows bands of increasing variability with increasing latitude, while the analysis of annual variability in Chl-a shows mostly mid-latitude high variability bands. Covariation patterns of SST and Chl-a suggests several different mechanisms impacting Chl-a change and variance. Our high spatial resolution analysis indicates these are likely to be operating at relatively small spatial scales. There are large regions showing warming and rising of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15209348355489093987", "cites_id": ["15209348355489093987"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33057-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y1kZKr91EtMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 9, "2020": 19, "2021": 23, "2022": 29, "2023": 17}}
