These variables include strong upwelling, cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong wind mixing, a deep and weakly stratified mixed layer, and low coastal sea level, indicating strong transport of the California Current. Principal component analysis indicates that these variables work in concert to define the dominant modes of physical variability, which appear to regulate nutrient availability and biological productivity. Multiple regression analysis suggests that coho marine survival is significantly and independently related to the dominant modes acting over this region \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5555374559964922201", "cites_id": ["5555374559964922201"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2419.2002.00187.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WYHziLqnGE0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 9, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 12, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 4}}
