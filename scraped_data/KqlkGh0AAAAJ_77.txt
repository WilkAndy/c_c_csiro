Their use to date has highlighted conditions under which no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) may help us to achieve the goals of ecosystem-based management by reducing pressures, and where they might fail to achieve desired goals. For example, static reserve designs are unlikely to achieve desired objectives when applied to mobile species or when compromised by climate-related ecosystem restructuring and range shifts. Modelling tools allow planners to explore a range of options, such as basing MPAs on the presence of dynamic oceanic features, and to evaluate the potential future impacts of alternative interventions compared with \u2018no-action\u2019 counterfactuals, under a range of environmental and development scenarios. The modelling environment allows the analyst to test if indicators and management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16344767703022738608", "cites_id": ["16344767703022738608"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2014.0278", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sJzyqqBH1OIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 13, "2018": 9, "2019": 13, "2020": 21, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
