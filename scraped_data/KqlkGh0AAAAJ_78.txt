Fisheries scientists in particular have explored a range of relationships between physics and catch data to understand fish distribution and fishing impacts. The explanatory power of models based on such primary variables is typically limited and may not lead to insight into mechanisms behind the environmental associations. Variables that are more direct measures of habitat, such as thermal fronts, upwelling zones, eddies, and water column descriptors (e.g., mixed layer depth), may yield additional explanatory power. We have developed a suite of these derived variables and demonstrate their utility using examples from Australian fisheries \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7647146697928029460", "cites_id": ["7647146697928029460"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24862218", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FDVNy2cfIGoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 9, "2017": 17, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 12, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
