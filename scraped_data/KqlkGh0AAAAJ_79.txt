These changes have been variously attributed to fisheries\u2010induced evolution, inhibited adult growth rate due to oxygen limitation at higher temperatures, and plastic responses to density dependence or changes in ocean productivity. Here, we review the diverse underlying mechanisms by which plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change and fisheries are likely to produce similar life\u2010history trends in harvested marine ectotherms, leading to faster life\u2010histories with earlier maturation and smaller adult size\u2010at\u2010age. While mechanistically understanding these growth and maturation changes may be difficult, it is becoming clear that changing life\u2010histories will lead to modified population dynamics, productivity and natural mortality of the affected species. We discuss how the observed and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4262219925034072735", "cites_id": ["4262219925034072735"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12156", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n3o_inByJjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 11, "2019": 13, "2020": 16, "2021": 14, "2022": 17, "2023": 11}}
