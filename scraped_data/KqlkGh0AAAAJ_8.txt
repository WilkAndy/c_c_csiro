Recently, studies have moved beyond correlation-based inference to demonstrate mechanistic links between warming and biological responses, particularly in regions experiencing rapid change. However, the assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation options that humans can undertake are at the earliest stages, particularly for marine systems. Here, we use trends in ocean temperature to characterize regions that can act as natural laboratories or focal points for early learning. These discrete marine \u2018hotspots\u2019, where ocean warming is fastest, were identified based on 50 years of historical sea surface temperature data. Persistence of these hotspots into the future was evaluated using global climate models. This analysis provides insights and a starting point \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 546, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10188935309789829501", "cites_id": ["10188935309789829501"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-013-9326-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fRl1U65eZo0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 22, "2015": 35, "2016": 57, "2017": 47, "2018": 59, "2019": 73, "2020": 67, "2021": 78, "2022": 73, "2023": 31}}
