As such, they represent early warning systems for understanding the impacts of marine climate change, and test\u2010beds for developing adaptation options for coping with those impacts. Here, we examine five hotspots off the coasts of eastern Australia, South Africa, Madagascar, India and Brazil. These particular hotspots have underpinned a large international partnership that is working towards improving community adaptation by characterizing, assessing and projecting the likely future of coastal\u2010marine food resources through the provision and sharing of knowledge. To inform this effort, we employ a high\u2010resolution global ocean model forced by Representative Concentration Pathway \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9754828864053216927", "cites_id": ["9754828864053216927"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13247", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:n4aeJisdYIcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 12, "2018": 8, "2019": 17, "2020": 18, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
