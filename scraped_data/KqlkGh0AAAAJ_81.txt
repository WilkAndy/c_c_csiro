Domestic tuna fleets and local fish processing operations contribute 3\u201320 % to gross domestic product in four PICTs and licence fees from foreign fleets provide an average of 3\u201340 % of government revenue for seven PICTs. More than 12,000 people are employed in tuna processing facilities and on tuna fishing vessels. Fish is a cornerstone of food security for many PICTs and provides 50\u201390 % of dietary animal protein in rural areas. Several PICTs have plans to (1) increase the benefits they receive from oceanic fisheries by increasing the amount of tuna processed locally, and (2) allocate more tuna for the food security of their rapidly growing populations.
