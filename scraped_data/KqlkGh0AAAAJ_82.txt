Data on hatchery-reared coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from individual releases (1973  1998) along the species' entire North American range were  analyzed to provide information on survival and size. Three geographic regions (north of Vancouver Island, Puget Sound and Strait of Georgia, and the outer coast south of the tip of Vancouver Island) showed coherent trends in  survival and size of returning fish. Within each region, multivariate nonlinear models were used to relate coho survival and final size to spatially and temporally tailored environmental variables at time periods of release, jack return, and adult return. The most important environmental variable, as indicated by the highest amount of variance explained, was a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17179009852710673220", "cites_id": ["17179009852710673220"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f01-145", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RFvBV3EaaO4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 10, "2005": 6, "2006": 4, "2007": 9, "2008": 6, "2009": 13, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
