The development of response options for users of marine resources, such as fishers, is important in guiding adaptation efforts. However, harvesting fish is only the first step in a supply chain that delivers seafood to consumers. Impacts higher up the chain have seldom been considered in fisheries-climate research yet an understanding of these impacts and how climate risks and adaptation information are interpreted and used by stakeholders across the chain is vital for developing viable and sustainable adaptation options. We examined stakeholder perceptions of points where climate change impacts and adaptations currently occur, or may occur in the future, across the supply chains of several Australian fisheries (southern rock lobster, tropical rock lobster, prawn) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12134529046951593031", "cites_id": ["12134529046951593031"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096313000065", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:R4Q1cOCBZqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 8, "2018": 12, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 18, "2023": 1}}
