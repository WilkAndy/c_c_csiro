To assist adaptation planning and the implementation of adaptation strategies, identifying barriers and enablers to adaptation is important. Adaptive capacity, resource dependence, local climate change exposure and biological sensitivity were used to assess socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change in three Australian coastal communities: St Helens, Tasmania; Bowen, Queensland; and Geraldton, Western Australia. Higher adaptive capacity was associated with larger population size (i.e., Geraldton) whereas greater resource dependence, and lower human and natural capital were associated with smaller populations (St Helens and Bowen). Socioeconomic vulnerability was greatly influenced by climate exposure and sensitivity with the moderately sized Bowen having \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:sJsF-0ZLhtgC", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16792989705645031987", "cites_id": ["16792989705645031987"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/26270198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M4LDCSqvDOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 10, "2018": 15, "2019": 16, "2020": 6, "2021": 16, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
