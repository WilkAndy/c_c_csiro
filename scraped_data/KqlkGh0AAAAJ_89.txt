These resources are commonly under stress from overfishing, pollution, coastal development and habitat degradation. Climate change is an additional stressor beginning to impact coastal systems and communities, but may also lead to opportunities for some species and the people they sustain. We describe the research approach for a multi-country project, focused on the southern hemisphere, designed to contribute to improving fishing community adaptation efforts by characterizing, assessing and predicting the future of coastal-marine food resources, and co-developing adaptation options through the provision and sharing of knowledge across fast-warming marine regions (i.e. marine \u2018hotspots\u2019). These hotspots represent natural laboratories for observing change and concomitant human adaptive responses, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14214187578924917531", "cites_id": ["14214187578924917531"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-016-9419-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G-OWBEvwQsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 15, "2019": 17, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
