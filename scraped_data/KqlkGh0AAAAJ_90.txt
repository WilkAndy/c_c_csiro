We present a process designed to assist managers identify biological indicators and essential variables for marine ecosystems, and demonstrate its application to Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone. The process begins with a spatially explicit description of key ecological systems and predicts how these systems are impacted by anthropogenic pressures. The process does not require experts to agree on the system's structure or the activities that threaten the ecosystem. Rather it defines a suite of pressure scenarios that accommodate uncertainty in these aspects, and seeks to identify indicators that are predicted to respond in a consistent fashion across \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6401443660477311861", "cites_id": ["6401443660477311861"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X15002265", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dSttyBd_1lgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 6, "2018": 19, "2019": 11, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
