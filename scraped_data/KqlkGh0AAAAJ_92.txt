Oceans provide the main source of animal protein for over a billion people, and contribute significantly to food security for billions more. Clearly, if we are to continue to derive these benefits, then the rate of adaptation in our human systems needs to at least keep pace with the rate of ecological change for these benefits to continue. An Australia-wide program of research into marine biodiversity and fisheries explored the opportunities for policy and management to respond to a changing climate. The research program spanned all Australian estuarine-nearshore and marine environments\u2014tropical, subtropical, and temperate\u2014and focused on two key marine sectors: biodiversity conservation and fisheries (commercial, recreational, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 75, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11740236908598315500", "cites_id": ["11740236908598315500"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-015-9925-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7MnuE0Sz7aIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 17, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
