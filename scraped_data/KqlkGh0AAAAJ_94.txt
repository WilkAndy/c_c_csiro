Three indices of upwelling activity and primary production are developed based on alongshore wind stress, upwelling plume area (anomalous sea surface temperature), and primary productivity of the upwelling plume (approximated using anomalous chlorophyll a concentration). The majority of the upwelling activity occurs during the austral summer upwelling season from November to March. Interannual variability in the wind forcing for this region shows marginal correspondence to El Nino\u2010Southern Oscillation variability. Intraseasonal variability followed four distinct phases within the upwelling season of \"onset,\" \"sustained,\" \"quiescent,\" and \"downwelling\" periods. The Bonney Upwelling is a predictable regional system with temporal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1082348948116792414", "cites_id": ["1082348948116792414"], "pub_url": "https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2009.54.5.1548", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XuSEP6JGBQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 9, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
