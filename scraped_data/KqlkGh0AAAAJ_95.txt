This is threatening sustainability and societal wellbeing. Responding to these complex and synergistic challenges requires holistic management arrangements. To this end, ecosystem-based management (EBM) promises much by recognising the need to manage the ecosystem in its entirety, including the human dimensions. However, operationalisation of EBM in the marine environment has been slow. One reason may be a lack of the inter-disciplinary science required to address complex social\u2013ecological marine systems. In the present paper, we synthesise the collective experience of the authors to explore progress in integrating natural and social sciences in marine EBM research, illustrating actual and potential contributions. We identify informal barriers to and incentives for this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4754525293908410943", "cites_id": ["4754525293908410943"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF17248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:P0IFc5B3-0EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 19, "2021": 29, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
