Understanding the impacts of fishing on habitats is a necessary part of adopting EBM, but multi-scale data that describe the types and distributions of habitats, and the interactions of fishing with them, are typically limited or entirely lacking. An approach developed to address habitat impacts, and applied to all offshore bottom contact fisheries in Australian waters, forms part of a hierarchical risk assessment framework \u2013 the Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). Its progressively quantitative hierarchical approach enables higher-risk interactions to be identified and prioritised in the early and intermediate assessment stages by screening out lower-risk interactions. The approach makes the best use of all available data, but it can also be inferential where data are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5688051951514775795", "cites_id": ["5688051951514775795"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783611000488", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:83ABAh0F8E4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 12, "2016": 7, "2017": 9, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
