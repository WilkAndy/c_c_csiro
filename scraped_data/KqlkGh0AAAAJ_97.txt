Equilibrium assumptions common in many modelling approaches need to be replaced by formulations that allow for changing baselines and integration of ongoing changes and adaptations by species, ecosystems and humans. As ecosystems change, so will the ways humans use, monitor and manage them. Consequently, adaptive management loops and supporting tools deserve more prominence in the management toolbox. Models are critical tools for providing an early understanding of the challenges to be faced by integrating observations and examining possible solutions. We review modelling tools currently available to incorporate the effect of climate change on marine and freshwater ecosystems, and the implications for management of natural resources. System non-linearity can confound interpretations and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11581524929796680850", "cites_id": ["11581524929796680850"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF10279", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kqzc5Y_XuaAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 13, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
