An understanding of future environmental conditions can assist marine resource users plan their activities, minimise risks due to adverse conditions, and maximise opportunities. Short-term farm management is assisted by weather forecasts, but longer term planning may be hampered by an absence of useful climate information at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we use dynamical seasonal forecasts to predict water temperatures for south-east Tasmanian Atlantic salmon farm sites several months into the future. High summer temperatures pose a significant risk to production systems of these farms. Based on twenty years of historical validation, the model shows useful skill (i.e., predictive ability) for all months of the year at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "KqlkGh0AAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 72, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14944385019482636180", "cites_id": ["14944385019482636180"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212096313000041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lH_uGP8eZc8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 5}}
