Hydroxy\u2010AI interlayered smectite and vermiculite are thought to occur in soils as either weathering products derived from chlorite weathering or more commonly from the deposition of hydroxy\u2010AI polymeric components within the interlayer spaces of these expansible or limited expansible layer silicates. Structural breakdown of the chlorite crystals is associated with the weight loss upon heating as well as with significant changes in infrared spectra. One approach to the identification of chlorites is an evaluation of their chemical stability or equilibria properties, so that one may differentiate chlorites from hydroxy\u2010interlayered clays. Polymeric hydroxy\u2010AI components significantly modify the physicochemical properties of soil minerals. The interlayer hydroxide material of chlorite and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 670, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5389421653059854907", "cites_id": ["5389421653059854907"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssabookser1.2ed.c15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O2JuZ3ASy0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 11, "1992": 12, "1993": 11, "1994": 9, "1995": 19, "1996": 17, "1997": 20, "1998": 21, "1999": 25, "2000": 20, "2001": 15, "2002": 22, "2003": 35, "2004": 20, "2005": 19, "2006": 19, "2007": 24, "2008": 24, "2009": 28, "2010": 20, "2011": 19, "2012": 28, "2013": 31, "2014": 18, "2015": 13, "2016": 13, "2017": 22, "2018": 26, "2019": 24, "2020": 26, "2021": 17, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
