Available evidence suggests that, in the absence of added base, aqueous solutionsof a simple Al salt can be accurately described by consideration of the hexaaquo ion, mononu-clear hydrolysis products and, in sufficiently dilute solu-tions with concomitant increases in pH, solid-phase tri-hydroxides such as gibbsite (1, 2). When Al solutions are partially neutralizedvia addition of base, a much more complex system results, and an abundant body of research has focused on the prevalence of one or more polynuclear hydroxo-Al complexes (eg, refs 1-3). Although these species have been treated thermodynamically (ie, via development of formation constants; see, eg, refs 4-6), their critical dependence on reaction conditions clearly points to a role as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 282, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9579975560015884775", "cites_id": ["9579975560015884775"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00029a006", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:57Gr0wPp8oQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 6, "1994": 5, "1995": 8, "1996": 5, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 4, "2003": 10, "2004": 17, "2005": 10, "2006": 19, "2007": 19, "2008": 17, "2009": 14, "2010": 13, "2011": 25, "2012": 16, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 9, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
