Uranium is unavailable for plant uptake, but elevated U and Ni concentrations associated with foliage of understory plants suggested mass loading. Mass loading of contaminated soil on Andropogon elliottii Chapman (Poaceae) was investigated using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The technique allows for rapid quantitative elemental depth profiling. Fresh washed and unwashed leaves (n     = 5) from the contaminated area were compared with those from an uncontaminated area, analysing Ni and U at ten randomly chosen points on each leaf. Nickel and U concentrations differed significantly between washed and unwashed leaves from LTB. Particles on unwashed leaves measured up to 300 \u00b5m in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3487622870293567802", "cites_id": ["3487622870293567802"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2004/em/b310878c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OllgtoWGZjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 2}}
