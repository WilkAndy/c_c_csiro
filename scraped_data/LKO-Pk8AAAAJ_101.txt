Incorporating transgenerational epigenetic heritability into risk assessment procedures has been previously suggested. However, a critical review of existing literature yielded numerous studies claiming transgenerational impacts, with little compelling evidence. Therefore, contaminant-induced epigenetic inheritance may be less common than is reported in the literature. We identified a need for multigeneration epigenetic studies that extend beyond what could be deemed \u201cdirect exposure\u201d to F1 and F2 gametes and also include subsequent multiple nonexposed generations to adequately evaluate transgenerational recovery times. Also, increased experimental replication is required to account for the highly variable nature of epigenetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18401290154329827228", "cites_id": ["18401290154329827228"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b01094", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nOe4seaDXv8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 5, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
