The clay mineralogy of the surface soil consisted primarily of kaolinite, hydroxy\u2010interlayered vermiculite, and gibbsite, while the dominant clay mineralogy of the subsurface materials consisted of kaolinite, goethite, and mica (illite). Repacked columns of the four differing strata were leached with tritiated (\u223c 200 pCi mL\u20131) Bromide solutions, either MgBr2 or KBr, of varying ionic strengths (0.1\u20130.001 N). Pore\u2010water velocities estimated by bulk density and mass flux were consistent with those estimated from tritium breakthrough. In contrast, Br\u2013 breakthrough differed drastically within the four materials and was altered by experimental conditions (sample drying \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7629956608234972014", "cites_id": ["7629956608234972014"], "pub_url": "https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1996.tb02070.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bmN9JRwN42kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 7, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
