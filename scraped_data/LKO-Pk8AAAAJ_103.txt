Aluminium speciation was dependent on the cell wall concentration. At low cell wall concentrations, significant amounts of the very toxic Al13 species were formed. At higher cell wall concentrations, formation of the tridecamer was hindered or completely inhibited. The sensitive wheat cultivars displayed a higher affinity for aluminium than the tolerant cultivars. A possible Al tolerance mechanism based on cell wall permeability is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13853836605674181403", "cites_id": ["13853836605674181403"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-86.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G1OD-f22QsAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 7, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
