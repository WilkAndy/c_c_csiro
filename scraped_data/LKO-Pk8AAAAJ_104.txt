Two pathways for degradation of TPB could be studied both independently and simultaneously. Sur-face-facilitated oxidation of TPB to diphenylboric acid (DPBA) at Lewis acidsites on clay mineral surfaces was investigated on three members of the smectite family of clays. No degradation of TPB occurred on hectorite, which contains no structural Fe. TPB degraded to DPBA on montmorillonite and nontronite. A color change in nontronite indicated the production of mixed valance Fe3+-0-Fe2+ states and clearly demonstrates the reduction of structural iron during the course of thereaction. The degradation of TPB to triphenylboron (TriPB) at Bronsted acid sites could alsobe measured on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13571051313197024164", "cites_id": ["13571051313197024164"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00053a024", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pAO1T0QPVrwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 6, "1997": 4, "1998": 7, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
