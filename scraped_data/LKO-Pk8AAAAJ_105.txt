Little evidence establishing the presence of complexes on the exchange phase has hitherto been provided, however. Adsorption experiments in which \u00b5M F solutions were equilibrated with K\u2010, Ca\u2010, and Al\u2010saturated cation\u2010exchange resins demonstrated substantial F removal to the Al\u2010saturated resin, with the adsorbed F quantitatively recovered with a single wash with 1.0 M NH4Cl, whereas no F removal was observed when either K or Ca occupied the exchange sites. Removal of both Al and F from Al\u2010F solutions equilibrated with K\u2010 and Ca\u2010saturated resins provided additional evidence for adsorption as fluoro\u2010Al complexes. Modeling of the competitive complexation\u2010exchange reactions with MINTEQA2 yielded results that under \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=673985242813886976", "cites_id": ["673985242813886976"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1991.03615995005500010012x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:APLG5QF6WgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
