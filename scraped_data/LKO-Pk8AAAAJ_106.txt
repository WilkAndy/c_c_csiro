Growth of Burkholderia cepacia PR1301 was not affected at 3.41 mM Ni at pH 5, but was inhibited by 73.2% at pH 6 and inhibited completely at pH 7 compared to growth without Ni. This pH effect was not observed in the Niresistant strains, Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 and 31A. Predicted Ni speciation did not explain the observed toxicity trends. Sorption of Ni to PR1 increased with increasing pH (1.49, 1.12, and 3.88 mg Ni/g dry weight at pH 5, 6, and 7, respectively), but was low at all three pH values, and most likely does not explain the observed pH effect. Growth inhibition of PR1 with increasing pH also was observed for other divalent cations, with growth observed at 4.24 mM Co, 2.22 mM Cd, and 3.82 mM Zn at pH 5 and 6, but totally inhibited at pH 7.
