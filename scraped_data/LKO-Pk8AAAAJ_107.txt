Geochemical and historical information about both areas are well documented. Following spillway breaches at SP in 1984 and the early 1990s, TB is inundated with contaminated sediments during storms. Bulk elemental composition of tree cores was determined using ICP\u2212OES. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) analysis showed that the metal contents of SP and TB cores were an order of magnitude higher than those from a reference site. TB cores were enriched with Ni in 1984 and 1991, corresponding with SP spillway breaches (containing 790 mg kg-1 Ni in 1991). Cores from SP exhibited an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=168789471828565180", "cites_id": ["168789471828565180"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es0261628", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vNwqXiGpVwIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
