This study used synchrotron X\u2010ray fluorescence (SXRF) compositional imaging to investigate the spatial distribution of Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Fe in annual rings of black willow (Salix nigra L.) collected from a metal\u2010contaminated area, and used X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate Ni and Mn speciation in regions of the annual rings with elevated Ni concentrations. Annual rings were recollected in early 2003 from an individual known to be enriched with Ni from previous studies. Compositional imaging showed Ni and associated co\u2010contaminants conservatively located in an annual ring. When compared with a corresponding photomicrograph, SXRF compositional images showed that metals were sharply constrained by the boundaries of the annual ring, indicating a sudden onset and cessation of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3163951548510033052", "cites_id": ["3163951548510033052"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2004.0461", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nNR8hyud6CsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 5, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
