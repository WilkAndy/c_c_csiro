Goethites were synthesized at either pH 6 or 11, at temperatures of 40 or 70\u00b0C, and in the presence or absence of sorbed Mn or Pb. Data from HRTGA analysis revealed at least four distinct weight-loss events near goethite dehydroxylation that relate to 1) three events involving the evolution of water associated with surface Fe-O functional groups and 2) bulk dehydroxylation of goethite during transformation to hematite. The relative mass of evolved surface and bulk structural water was related to the predominant particle morphology as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Differentiation of surface and bulk decomposition reactions allowed the identification of bulk structural dehydroxylation.
