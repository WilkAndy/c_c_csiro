We measured rates of Al transport across membranes in single cells of Chara corallina using the rare26Al isotope, an emerging technology (accelerator mass spectrometry), and a surgical technique for isolating subcellular compartments. Accumulation of Al in the cell wall dominated total uptake (71\u2013318 \u03bcg m\u22122 min\u22121), although transport across the plasma membrane was detectable (71\u2013540 ng m\u22122 min\u22121) within 30 min of exposure. Transport across the tonoplast was initially negligible, but accelerated to rates approximating uptake across the plasma membrane. The avacuolate protoplasm showed signs of saturation after 60 min, but continued movement across the plasma membrane was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 263, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12153443367208573869", "cites_id": ["12153443367208573869"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plphys/article-abstract/123/3/987/6087637", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rVtLzFm0qagJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 15, "2002": 5, "2003": 9, "2004": 15, "2005": 17, "2006": 8, "2007": 11, "2008": 16, "2009": 15, "2010": 13, "2011": 10, "2012": 15, "2013": 14, "2014": 15, "2015": 14, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
