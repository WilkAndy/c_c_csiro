This study examined the distribution of Li in the soils and surface waters of the southeastern U.S.A., contrasting the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions. Previous studies have been limited to total, and to a lesser extent exchangeable, soil Li, usually at a single soil depth. This study evaluated more carefully the distribution of Li between the soil solution, exchange, and solid phases, and its distribution within soil profiles. Total soil Li was found to correlate strongly with clay content, and ranged from 3.74 to 59.93 mg/kg. Exchangeable Li ranged from 0.1 to 21.8 \u03bcmol/kg soil and constituted an insignificant portion of the total exchangeable cations (<0.09%) and total Li present (<1.1%) in the soils studied. Water-soluble Li ranged from 0.08 to 4.62 \u03bcg/l.
