Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has emerged as a promising tool employed in public health response in many countries globally. This study aimed to establish whether the surveillance of aircraft wastewater can be used to provide an additional layer of information to augment individual clinical testing. Wastewater from 37 long-haul flights chartered to repatriate Australians was tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Children 5 years or older on these flights tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) (deep nasal and oropharyngeal reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR swab) 48 h before \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8434260145005297840", "cites_id": ["8434260145005297840"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021005638", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sIBGTuqCDHUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 18, "2023": 16}}
