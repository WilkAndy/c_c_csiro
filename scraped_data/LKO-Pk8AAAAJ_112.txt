X-rays delivered by synchrotron sources are more than 95% polarized in the central part of the plane of rotation of the synchrotron electrons, and the polarization rate is further increased because of the polarization that occurs during monochromation of the incident beam. Because of the highly polarized nature of synchrotron radiation, one can obtain angularly resolved structural information through analysis of the angular dependence of X-ray absorption spectra for anisotropic samples. Originally, this technique was applied to single phyllosilicate crystals (Manceau etal. 1988; Manceau etal. 1990), and we show here that it can be extended to self-supporting films of fine-grained layered minerals. The angular variation of P-EXAFS spectra sensitively depends on the orientation distribution of individual mineral platelets in the prepared film. In the case of smectites, highly oriented films can be prepared, which allows us to precisely probe their 3-dimensional local structure without loss of spatial resolution as compared to single crystals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4228495130561587295", "cites_id": ["4228495130561587295"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruno-Lanson-2/publication/268443784_Application_of_Polarized_Exafs_to_Fine-Grained_Layered_Minerals/links/5791f3bb08ae33e89f74e73f/Application-of-Polarized-Exafs-to-Fine-Grained-Layered-Minerals.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X6iX7-qhrjoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
