From a regulatory standpoint this presents a potential problem since it is not trivial to detect free metal ions in the presence of nanoparticles in biological or natural media. This makes efforts to identify the route of uptake difficult. Although in vitro studies of zinc oxide nanoparticles suggest that toxicity to the soil bacterium Cupriavidus necator is exerted in a similar manner to zinc acetate, we found no free Zn ion is associated with nanoparticle suspensions. The proteome of cells subjected to equal concentrations of either the nanoparticle or zinc acetate suggest that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11316163816521985968", "cites_id": ["11316163816521985968"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17435390.2011.579633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sO_rFwkXC50J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
