The retardation of contaminants is often greatest at boundaries between minerals and in fractures and pore spaces. The investigation of the spatial distribution of sorbed contaminants along these boundaries requires micro-analytical techniques. The sorption of dissolved Pu(V) on a natural zeolitic tuff from Yucca Mountain (NV, USA) was examined using microautoradiography (MAR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microprobe (EM) techniques, and synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-SXRF). The tuff contained a heterogeneous distribution of zeolites and trace quantities of smectites, Fe oxides (hematite), and Mn oxides (rancieite), which are present as fracture fill and pore space materials. Micro-SXRF studies showed that Pu is mostly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12290559930921971067", "cites_id": ["12290559930921971067"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772200001509", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e-1AlSPXkKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
