Several Al speciation methods are useful for providing estimates of organically and inorganically complexed Al and adequately differentiating soluble from colloidal Al components. Additionally, comprehensive geochemical speciation models can be used effectively to delimit the boundary conditions describing Al solubility and solution species distribution. Neither of these approaches, however, can provide reliable information regarding specific molecular distributions of Al. Little work has focused on Al species transformation in natural systems, yet such reactions may be the primary regulators of Al mobility in natural systems, particularly during episodic events."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11848976322337661176", "cites_id": ["11848976322337661176"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4456-1_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-GDzxC8FcKQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 4, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
