As a result, this study was undertaken to examine the dynamics of Al complexation in the presence of multiple ligands, specifically fluoride (F), oxalate (Ox), and citrate (Cit), utilizing an ion chromatographic speciation method. The rate constant for formation (kf) of AlF2+ under the experimental conditions used in this investigation was found to be 12.3 \u00b1 1.1 M\u22121s\u22121 in the absence of competing ligands, but was observed to increase to 23.4 \u00b1 0.6 and 52.0 \u00b1 5.7 M\u22121s\u22121 in the presence of Ox and Cit, respectively. The rate of formation of the AlOx+ complex was more rapid than that of AlF2+ (kf \u2243 100 M\u22121s\u22121) and was unaffected \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8874608894706606114", "cites_id": ["8874608894706606114"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200060015x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ImCCIcXxKHsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 5, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
