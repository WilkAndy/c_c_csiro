We examined toxicogenomic responses of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to pristine and transformed ZnO-MNPs (phosphatized pZnO- and sulfidized sZnO-MNPs). To account for the toxicity due to dissolved Zn, a ZnSO4 treatment was included. Transformation of ZnO-MNPs reduced their toxicity by nearly ten-fold, while there was almost no difference in the toxicity of pristine ZnO-MNPs and ZnSO4. This combined with the fact that far more dissolved Zn was released from ZnO- compared to pZnO- or sZnO-MNPs, suggests that dissolution of pristine ZnO-MNPs is one of the main drivers of their toxicity. Transcriptomic responses at the EC30 for reproduction resulted in a total of 1161 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11072738015623348824", "cites_id": ["11072738015623348824"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749118338570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WIIxMI9EqpkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
