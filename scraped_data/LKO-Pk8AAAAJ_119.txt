Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to ICP-MS was used to investigate the speciation of Se, As, Cu, Cd and Zn in tissue extracts from a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) collected from a coal fly ash basin and results were compared to a largemouth bass collected at a reference site. Using a Biosil SEC column, with an effective separation range of 100\u20137 KDa, Cu, Zn and Cd were shown to be bound to metallothionein (MT) in the liver, gill and, to a lesser extent, gonad tissue extract. In liver, muscle and gill of the ash basin bass, Se was predominantly present as low molecular weight species. Only in the gonad extract was the major fraction of Se associated with high molecular weight species. For the liver and gill extracts, further SEC-ICP-MS on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8306426199963811433", "cites_id": ["8306426199963811433"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-002-1337-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aT7XmZ5aRnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
