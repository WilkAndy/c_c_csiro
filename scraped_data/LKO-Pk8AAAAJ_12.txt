Remediation treatments included Cr-free groundwater and buffered and unbuffered Fe(II) solutions as either FeCl2 and FeSO4. The slow release of Cr(VI) from the Fe-oxide rich subsurface sediment following exposure to Cr-free solutions indicated that simple pump-and-treat procedures would require extended operation time to meet regulatory standards. In situ reduction was confirmed by the loss of Cr(VI) and Fe(II) from solution and a drop in pH compared to control systems. Batch and column-effluent Cr(VI) decreased with increasing Fe(II), generally falling below detection limits as the persistence of Fe(II) occurred. However, CrDissolved, presumably Cr(III), exceeded regulatory limits due to the low pH (\u22483.0) induced by oxidation and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 263, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2214559461451753277", "cites_id": ["2214559461451753277"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es980546+", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PefP0Riyux4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 7, "2001": 8, "2002": 8, "2003": 11, "2004": 8, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 9, "2008": 9, "2009": 13, "2010": 11, "2011": 13, "2012": 21, "2013": 21, "2014": 16, "2015": 18, "2016": 9, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 15, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
