Occasional observations of anomalous exchange of Li have been reported, without any clear explanation. This study was initiated to more carefully examine Li exchange in complex soil-solution and clay mineral systems. At the low concentrations employed, Li was sorbed preferentially by the southeastern US soils evaluated over excesses of Na, K, Mg, and Ca in the adsorption solution phase. Trace amounts of Li were also sorbed to bentonite, kaolinite, and vermiculite clay samples in the presence of 0.01 M Mg (NO 3) 2 (5.82, 3.67, and 8.37 \u03bcg g\u2212 1, respectively). The bentonite retained no Li against displacement by M NH 4 Cl, but both the kaolinite and vermiculite fixed a substantial portion of the total \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11946317652953748923", "cites_id": ["11946317652953748923"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1989/07000/Exchange_and_Apparent_Fixation_of_Lithium_in.5.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u1VJbpzYyaUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
