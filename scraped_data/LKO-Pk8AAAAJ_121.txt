Micro-XANES analysis of the epithelial layer on the shell and of the bone tissue revealed that the keratin associated Se was present exclusively in seleno-amino acid coordination environments, whereas Se in the bone tissue was a mixture of selenate and proteinaceous Se. Elemental distribution maps of hyperaccumulating plants generated by XRF reveal a heterogeneous distribution of Se and Cr, with Se being concentrated within the nuclei of cells and Cr within discrete aggregates in the cytoplasm. Micro-XANES measurements taken on these same regions demonstrated the total loss of the Cr (VI) diagnostic pre-edge feature, indicating the complete reduction of the Cr (VI) to Cr (III) after uptake by the plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1050789872489731604", "cites_id": ["1050789872489731604"], "pub_url": "https://jp4.journaldephysique.org/articles/jp4/abs/1997/02/jp4199707C232/jp4199707C232.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FBZUW9InlQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
