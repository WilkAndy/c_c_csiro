Recent research has demonstrated that biosolids containing an environmentally relevant mixture of ZnO, TiO2, and Ag ENMs and their transformation products, including Ag2S a-ENMs, disrupted the symbiosis between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and legumes. However, this study was unable to unequivocally determine which ENM or combination of ENMs and a-ENMs was responsible for the observed inhibition. Here, we examined further the effects of polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP) coated pristine Ag ENMs (PVP-Ag), Ag2S a-ENMs, and soluble Ag (as AgSO4) at 1, 10, and 100 mg Ag kg\u22121 on the symbiosis between the legume Medicago truncatula and the nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Sinorhizobium melliloti in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12870280846197363226", "cites_id": ["12870280846197363226"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026974911630344X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GpIbbT1snLIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
