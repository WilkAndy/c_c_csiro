Two materials were used in a series of column leaching studies, a surface soil (Orangeburg Series) and an iron oxide-rich subsurface sediment (Tobacco Rd. Formation) both from Aiken, SC. For comparison, the same materials were leached with sodium hexametaphosphate (Na\u2212P) as a nonselective dispersing agent. As a cationic surfactant, HDTMA is generally considered a strong flocculent for soils because of its ability to shield the electrostatic repulsion on opposing negatively charged clays, which was observed in leaching experiments for the surface soil material.
