A very important consideration when applying advanced spectroscopic techniques to environmental samples is the appropriateness of the spectrometer environment for addressing the specific scientific question. In situ or noninvasive spectroscopic techniques allow samples to be examined in a fully aquated form with little or no sample manipulation. A major challenge in choosing suitable spectroscopic techniques to address fundamental questions in soil and environmental chemistry is the issue of scale. In recent years, noninvasive microspectroscopic capabilities with sufficient sensitivity to examine soil constituents have become increasingly available.
