However, few comprehensive three-dimensional datasets exist for critically evaluating the impact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion, and the conservative nature of several commonly used groundwater tracers is still in question. Therefore, we conducted a series of field-scale experiments using tritiated water (3H1HO), bromide (Br\u2212), and two fluorobenzoates (2,4 Di-FBA, 2,6 Di-FBA) as tracers in the water-table aquifer on the USDOE's Savannah River Site (SRS), located on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain. For each experiment, tracer-free groundwater was injected for approximately 24 h (56.7 L min\u22121) to establish a steady-state forced radial gradient before the introduction of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6806226377496457180", "cites_id": ["6806226377496457180"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/vzj/article-abstract/6/2/373/91951", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3O-RU9SSdF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
