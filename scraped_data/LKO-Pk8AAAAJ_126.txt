Factors influencing goethite morphology include pH and the presence or absence of specifically adsorbing ions in solution. Particle morphology can affect goethite dissolution behavior and will govern the distribution of coordination sites available on the particle surface (Cornell et al. 1974; Colombo et al. 1994). Morphological information can be obtained via electron microscopic imaging (Schulze and Schwertman n 1984) or profile analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Koch et al. 1986). These methods are essential for determination of absolute particle dimensions, but they may require a significant time commitment or advanced level of analysis. In order to facilitate rapid preliminary comparison of synthetic goethite samples, we have investigated the use of powder XRD to derive similar qualitative information via the influence of preferred orientation during sample preparation. Samples for XRD analysis were prepared according to the procedure outlined by Drever (1973) with some modifications. This and similar methods are commonly used to prepare clay powder samples displaying enhanced relative intensities in basal reflections (Brown and Brindley 1980). Filtering clay minerals from suspension leads to the formation of films of particles preferentially oriented with their basal planes parallel to the plane of the support. This preparation results in a sample with a biased distribution of crystallographic planes (in this case 001) coincident with the diffracting plane of the XRD instrument \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2352109667091408136", "cites_id": ["2352109667091408136"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/47018050/Goethite_Morphologies_Investigated_via_X20160705-13485-v3kndp.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:COW-u0dfpCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
