Additional water quality concerns with regard to coal storage include that coal stockpiles are relatively abundant, not restricted to areas associated with mining operations, and often uncontrolled. The interaction of these metalliferous acidleachates with more alkaline surface waters results in neutralization or dilution of acidity, precipitation of iron and aluminum hydroxides, oxyhydroxides, and/or basic sulfates (3-6), and sorption or coprecipitation of heavy metals to the freshly precipitated materials (7-11). Wangen and Jones (12) evaluated the capacity ofdifferent soils to neutralize coal mineral waste leachate and found that carbonate content governed acidity and also the metal concentrations of soil column effluent.
