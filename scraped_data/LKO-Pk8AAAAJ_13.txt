The decay rates of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and a potential surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), were investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in untreated wastewater, autoclaved wastewater, and dechlorinated tap water stored at 4, 15, 25, and 37 \u00b0C. Temperature, followed by matrix type, most greatly influenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA first-order decay rates (k). The average T90 (time required for 1-log10 reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA ranged from 8.04 to 27.8 days in untreated wastewater, 5.71 to 43.2 days in autoclaved wastewater, and 9.40 to 58.6 days in tap water. The average T90 for RNA of MHV at 4 to 37 \u00b0C ranged from 7.44 to 56.6 days in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 255, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15553734416093824200", "cites_id": ["15553734416093824200"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120309890", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yEQKUgv32dcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 10, "2021": 97, "2022": 106, "2023": 41}}
