Titration and adsorption experiments were performed to determine whether varietal differences in tolerance to Al toxicity or Fe stress were related to differences in surface chemical properties of the cell walls. Results of the soybean experiments indicate some differences in total binding capacity and Fe adsorption of the walls, but no differences in amounts of Ca adsorbed. The wheat cultivars do show a correlation of increased titratable acidity and Al adsorption with higher tolerance, but no differences in their relative preferences for Al or Ca."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12482327387368250834", "cites_id": ["12482327387368250834"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-0585-6_58", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0t025p8iOq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
