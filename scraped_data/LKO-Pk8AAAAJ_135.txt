After the addition of ferron to the partially neutralized Al solution, a large portion of the Al13 polymer was no longer observed by 27Al NMR spectroscopy. The data indicated that the observed initial loss in Al13 concentration resulted from precipitation with acetate (OAc) in the buffer, since the loss was not related to the ferron: Al molar ratio, because no corresponding increase in the Al\u2010ferron (\u03b4 = 3.4 ppm) resonance was observed and also because similar losses were noted in solutions where only NaOAc was added. The Al13 remaining in solution was characterized by a resonance with an identical chemical shift (\u03b4 = 62.5 ppm), yet having wider line widths at half\u2010maximum (v1/2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3309700968410724056", "cites_id": ["3309700968410724056"], "pub_url": "https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrc.1260270317", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2Dbjxn5r7i0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
