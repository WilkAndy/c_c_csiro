The objective of this research was to compare CEC values for arable Ultisols from the humid region of the United States as determined by procedures varying widely in their chemical conditions during measurement. Exchangeable cation quantities determined in the course of two of the CEC procedures were also evaluated. The six procedures evaluated were: (1) summation of N NH4OAc (pH 7.0) exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and Na plus BaCl2 \u2010 TEA (pH 8.0) exchangeable acidity; (2) N Ca(OAc)2 (pH 7.0) saturation with Mg(OAc)2 (pH 7.0) displacement of Ca2+; (3) N NH4OAc (pH 7.0) saturation with NaCl displacement of NH4 +; (4) N MgCl2 saturation with N KCl displacement of Mg2+; (5) compulsive exchange of Mg2+ for Ba2+; and (6) summation of N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7456643781590627054", "cites_id": ["7456643781590627054"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00103628209367315", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7rJVKgNSe2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
