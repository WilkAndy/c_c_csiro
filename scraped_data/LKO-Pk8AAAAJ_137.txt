XAFS measurements have also been made at the Br K absorption edge on the same 0.04 M solution mentioned above. Due to the many difficulties associated with obtaining high-quality XAFS data on these systems, a custom-manufactured 5-mil-thick Sc foil was used in conjunction with a Soller slit assembly to improve the XAFS signal-to-noise ratio by almost a factor of 6. XAFS analyses of the Cs\u2212D18C6 solution show the presence of a 1:1 Cs\u2212D18C6 complex with a Br contact ion, consistent with previous references derived from 133Cs nuclear \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14522277110728748365", "cites_id": ["14522277110728748365"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp9604608", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Te3FAhd-ickJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
