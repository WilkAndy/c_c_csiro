This study examined the effects of Ag2S nanoparticles (Ag2S-NPs) on the EW-mediated (Eisenia fetida and Pontoscolex corethrurus) soil N cycle. We used 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine the bacterial community and nitrification/denitrification-related gene abundance. The presence of either EWs or Ag significantly increased denitrification and N2O emissions. However, the addition of Ag2S to EW-inhabited soil reduced N2O emissions by 14\u201333%. Furthermore, Ag2S caused a low-dose stimulation but a high-dose inhibition to N2O flux from the EW gut itself. Accordingly, an increase in Ag in the EW gut caused a decrease in the relative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6812849021300521321", "cites_id": ["6812849021300521321"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c01241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aTn8vhYajF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
