Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy can quantitatively measure, in situ, both acid hydrolytic and oxidative degradation of TPB as controlled by the exchange cation identity and the structural octahedral Fe content of the clay mineral. Oxidation of TPB at smectite surfaces is directly attributable to octahedral Fe(III) in the clay structure. The concomitant reduction of Fe(III) during TPB oxidation can be analytically measured by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The resultant distortion of the clay mineral structure during the reduction of structural Fe could be probed directly by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5333395567127607527", "cites_id": ["5333395567127607527"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1998-0715.ch014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:57hIwQIHBEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
