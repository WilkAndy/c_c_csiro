While federal regulations govern acceptable As concentrations in edible tissue, elevated As concentrations occur in poultry litter, which raises concerns over repeated land application of poultry litter in agriculture. As a precursor to studying the fate of these organoarsenic compounds in soils, three speciation methodologies were developed to separate ROX and p-ASA from the more common and more toxic As species arsenate, arsenite, dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA), and monomethyl arsenic acid (MMA). The six arsenic species were separated on a Dionex AS14 column using a PO4 eluant, an AS16 column using a OH- eluant, and an AS7 column using a HNO3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11056831740881581168", "cites_id": ["11056831740881581168"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es0107172", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cLSCAOPBcZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 9, "2004": 10, "2005": 11, "2006": 5, "2007": 15, "2008": 17, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 17, "2012": 16, "2013": 19, "2014": 23, "2015": 15, "2016": 16, "2017": 13, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
