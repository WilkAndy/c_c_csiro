The fractions were characterized by elemental analysis and13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy. The majority of humic substances occur as humic acids, with bottomland soils having higher HA/FA ratios when compared to upland soils. We found no significant differences between upland and bottomland humic substances with respect to yields of WSOC and fulvic acids, and in the C and N content of humic and fulvic acids. Carbon-13 CPMAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that the WSOC and fulvic acid fractions were composed largely of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13500125462446888583", "cites_id": ["13500125462446888583"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00003220", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h1Za1JQUWrsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1}}
