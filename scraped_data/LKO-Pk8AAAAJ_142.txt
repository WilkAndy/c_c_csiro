For Al in the KCl and NH4Cl extracts, the method involved direct injection of the extract onto a Dionex CG\u20103 column, post column reaction and complexation of the Al in a Dionex reagent delivery module, and detection on a Dionex UV/Vis detector. The eluant consisted of 0.4 M NH4Cl acidified to pH 3.1. Standard curves were prepared by plotting the integrated peak intensities of the chromatograms against concentration of standard Al solutions. The standard curve has a very large dynamic linear range (0.05 to 15 mg L\u22121). The detection limits of the technique are 50 and 20 \u00b5g L\u22121 when utilizing a 50 and 100\u2010\u00b5L injection loop, respectively. The NH4\u2010oxalate extractable Al was determined by ashing a sample aliquot \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2340960110846489524", "cites_id": ["2340960110846489524"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200020046x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tDNdYNHCfCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
