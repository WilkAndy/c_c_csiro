An interest in the dynamics of Be in soil and aquatic systems prompted this evaluation of the distribution of Be within selected soils of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic regions of the southeastern USA. Water\u2010soluble soil Be was below detection limits (<0.2 \u00b5g L\u22121) for all series and depths. Exchangeable Be ranged from <0.1 to 2.2 \u00b5molckg\u22121, was consistently higher in the Piedmont relative to the Coastal Plain soils, and comprised only 0.0003 to 0.0083% of CEC. Total Be ranged from 0.3 to 30.5 mg kg\u22121 and, as with exchangeable Be, was consistently higher in the Piedmont soils. No significant correlation between exchangeable and total Be was found (r = 0.28). Exchangeable Be was weakly negatively correlated with depth, however (r = \u22120.36, significant at 0.10), while total Be tended to increase with depth (r = 0.44 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13874561581231923474", "cites_id": ["13874561581231923474"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900020024x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EmGcXz9YjMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
