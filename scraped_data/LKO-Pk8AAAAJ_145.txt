Mixtures of Fe3+ and Al3+ did not interact during neutralization; base consumed in their respective buffer regions was equivalent to the total metal added. Fe2+-Al3+ solutions, however, showed excess base consumption in the Al3+ buffer region, indicating hydrolysis of Fe2+ at lower than normal pH. Ferric/ferrous iron analyses of systems at the Al endpoint (pH 5.5) showed amounts of oxidized Fe equivalent to the excess base consumption (\u223c10% of total Fe), with substantial amounts of Fe2+ sorbed to or occluded within Al polymers present. Increased electrolyte levels or the presence of SO42- inhibited oxidation and sorption of Fe2+ on Al surfaces, suggesting that Fe hydrolysis and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9522354495221442616", "cites_id": ["9522354495221442616"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1346/CCMN.1989.0370102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OKgEOfYyJoQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2}}
