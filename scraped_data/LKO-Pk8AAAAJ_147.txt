Electrophoretic mobility and particle size of pure and mixed suspensions of KGa\u20102 kaolinite and SWy\u20101 bentonite were determined as a function of pH, ionic strength, and suspension concentration ratios. Kaolinite mobility changed from significant positive values at low pH to negative values at high pH, consistent with the variable\u2010charge nature of kaolinite. Evidence for a contribution of positive charge originating at bentonite edges at low pH (<4) was also found. Ionic strength also affected mobility of kaolinite and, at low pH, bentonite. Mixtures of kaolinite and bentonite at low pH yielded mobility distribution spectra intermediate to those of the component clays. The two populations were not resolved, which suggests that the kaolinite and bentonite formed mixed particle associations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16006756157436143132", "cites_id": ["16006756157436143132"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700060039x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HCZH8uprI94J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2}}
