The impact of colloid generation on formation permeability at injection rates ranging from 19 to 132 L min\u22121 was monitored using a set of six sampling wells radially spaced at approximate distances of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 m from a central injection well. Each sampling well was further divided into three discrete sampling depths that were pumped continuously at a rate of \u223c0.1 L min\u22121 throughout the course of the injection experiment. Discrete samples were collected for turbidity and chemical analysis. Turbidity varied greatly between sampling wells and zones within a given well, ranging from <1 to 740 NTU. The two sampling wells closest to the injection well displayed the greatest response in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2512798652002765897", "cites_id": ["2512798652002765897"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/vzj/article-abstract/6/2/363/91948", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SYy0hA9B3yIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
