Microscopic descriptions of NOC-organic matter interaction have been developed based on macroscopic observations of NOC sorption to organic matter and organic solute transport under varying conditions. These models include the partitioning concept describing NOC sorption to organic matter and the concept of intra-organic matter diffusion used to account for nonequilibrium organic solute transport; however, little microscopic information exists to validate them. NMR may be a powerful method to gain information and insight concerning NOC-organic matter interaction. Chemical shifts, linewidths, and the magnitude of spin-spin couplings exhibited in the NMR spectra of a given nucleus are dependent on the characteristics of the surrounding media and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9397706255135366149", "cites_id": ["9397706255135366149"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9397706255135366149&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BVzPQAxca4IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
