This study sought to evaluate the transport of dissolved components as coal pile runoff percolated through subsoil. Samples were collected from a site adjacent to a coal storage facility on the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Savannah River Site. The subsoils were packed in 25 x 2.5 cm columns to uniform bulk densities of 1.5 metric ton/m3 and subjected to steady, saturated flows of 0.2 and 1.3 cm/hr. Effluent was collected and solute transport through the subsoils was evaluated. Observed transport was then related to soil chemical and mineralogical properties. Sulfate mobility was found to be governed principally by ion exchange. Initial breakthrough of most cationic components was coincident with sulfate breakthrough and a result of the necessary condition of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9190750845904496672", "cites_id": ["9190750845904496672"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003070139-11/multicomponent-transport-soil-subjected-coal-pile-runoff-steady-saturated-flow-anderson-bertsch-zelazny", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IChCHTMbjH8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
