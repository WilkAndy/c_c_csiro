Although Ag2S is comparatively stable, its solubility increases with salinity, potentially altering its impacts on microbial communities due to the anti-microbial properties of Ag. In this study, we investigated the impacts of Ag on the microbially mediated N cycle in saline soils by examining the relationship between the (bio)availability of Ag2S and microbial functioning following the application of Ag2S-containing sludge. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that the Ag2S was stable within the soil, although extractable Ag concentrations increased up to 18-fold in soils with higher salinity. However, the extractable Ag accounted for <0.05% of the total Ag in all soils and had no impact on plant biomass or soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11904768415037134424", "cites_id": ["11904768415037134424"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120314688", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WBaUn8w7NqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 3}}
