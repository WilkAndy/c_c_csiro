Colloid-associated nitrogen (N) will have different mechanisms of biogeochemical cycling and potential for water-borne transport over longer distances compared to dissolved N. The role that colloids play in the supply and mobility of N within catchments discharging into the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon is unexplored. Here, we examine water-dispersible clay (WDC) from soil samples collected from gullies and agricultural drains within three different land uses (sugarcane, non-agricultural land and grazing) within the Townsville area. The proportion of soil N associated with WDC was inversely correlated with total soil N, with up to 45% of the total soil N being colloid-associated in low N gully soils. Within the <0.45\u2009\u00b5m fraction of the WDC, only 17\u201325% of the N was truly dissolved (<3\u2009kDa) at the gully sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6882605031389696195", "cites_id": ["6882605031389696195"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31115-z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w5BMec_sg18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
