Soils on the SRS are highly weathered and dominated by sand-sized quartz grains with the clay fraction consisting primarily of kaolinite and crystalline and poorly crystalline iron oxides (<5%). Our results showed that the majority of 137Cs in the Lower Three Runs Creek floodplain were retained in the sand-sized fraction (>52 mm) of the soil. Frayed edge site measurements were performed in order to probe the interaction between 137Cs and the sand fraction, with the results indicating that the vast majority of the 137Cs was strongly retained and existed in the residual fraction. These results prompted examination into the mineralogy of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7664983792275908544", "cites_id": ["7664983792275908544"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10967-005-0741-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wGe78yV-X2oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
