Many of these materials can be transformed during waste water treatment and ultimately enter terrestrial ecosystems via agriculturally applied biosolids. It is unclear how agriculturally important soil microbes will be affected by exposure to environmentally relevant, sublethal concentrations of ENMs and their transformation products (ie, ions, aggregates, etc.). A method was developed, which puts O 2 consumption responses in terms of viability, and tested by examining the toxic effects of Ag+, Zn 2+, and Ni 2+ ions on the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GB03. The method was then used to examine the toxicity of Ag+, as-synthesized polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated silver ENM (PVP-AgENMs), and 100% sulfidized AgENM on B. amyloliquefaciens GB03 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12078137164560677216", "cites_id": ["12078137164560677216"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.aip.org/avs/bip/article/12/5/05G604/124299", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YDkVKsIpnqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
