The constitutive trichloroethylene (TCE) degrader, Burkholderia vietnamiensis PR1301, grew at 34.1 and 1.7 mM Ni at pH 5 and 7, respectively, with 0.01 g mL-1 HA compared to 17 and 0.85 mM Ni without HA. PR1 grew at 4.2 mM U at pH 5 and 7 with 0.01 g mL-1 HA compared to 1.1 mM U without HA. A similar decrease in the toxicity of Ni and U in combination was observed with HA. The ability of PR1 to degrade TCE at 0.85, 1.7, and 3.4 mM Ni and at 0.42 and 1.1 mM U was examined. The presence of TCE resulted in a decreased tolerance of PR1 to Ni and U; however, HA facilitated TCE degradation in the presence of Ni and U, effectively doubling the metal concentrations at which TCE degradation proceeded. These studies suggest that metal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4306754398949112551", "cites_id": ["4306754398949112551"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es0616581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:53o2xE6qxDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
