XANES spectroscopy has provided detailed information on the oxidation states of U in contaminated soils on regions as small as 50 \u00b5m, with minimal sample manipulation. Qualitative information on bonding environments of U have been deduced based upon elemental associations generated at 10 \u00b5m spatial resolution on identical regions where complete XANES spectra were collected and also on the'fingerprint'or multiple scattering regions of the XANES spectra. Distinct regions within the sediments were found to contain phases of predominately U (VI) and U (IV). On the spatial scale examined, the U (VI) was present both as diffusely distributed and as discrete phases, whereas phases \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10079122522158615154", "cites_id": ["10079122522158615154"], "pub_url": "https://jp4.journaldephysique.org/articles/jp4/abs/1997/02/jp4199707C245/jp4199707C245.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ckrnTIg84IsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
