Measurement of the limestone materials influence on N NH4OAc extractable Ca and Mg and N KCl exchangeable Al, soil pH, and crop yields were utilized to study reaction rates. Field plots were established on a Goldsboro sandy loam (Aquic Paleudults) and an Emporia loamy sand (Typic Hapludults) in the Coastal Plain region. Corn was the indicator crop for the Goldsboro soil, while soybeans were grown on the Emporia soil. Treatments ranged from 0 to 13.94 and 0 to 4.48 metric tons/ha on the Goldsboro and Emporia soils, respectively. Initially, extractable soil Ca and Mg increased and exchangeable Al decreased more rapidly with suspension limestone applications than with conventional treatments.
