Primary particle size, hydrodynamic size, and zeta potential were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and electrophoretic mobility measurements, respectively. Plants were exposed to NPs hydroponically for 3 or 7 days for wheat and tobacco, respectively. Volume averaged Au concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Spatial distribution of Au in tissue samples was determined using laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) and scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy (\u03bcXRF). Both C-MNMs and T-MNMs of each size treatment bioaccumulated in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 242, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9806764767580910798", "cites_id": ["9806764767580910798"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3019397", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zvR5_5igGIgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 14, "2014": 13, "2015": 13, "2016": 28, "2017": 21, "2018": 24, "2019": 33, "2020": 25, "2021": 27, "2022": 27, "2023": 12}}
