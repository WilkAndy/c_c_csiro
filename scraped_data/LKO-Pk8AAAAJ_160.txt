Batch and column experiments were used to evaluate potential remediation scenarios and the migration hazard of U and Ni from flood-plain sediments collected along Tims Branch. Treatment solutions included a low-ionic-strength groundwater surrogate (artificial groundwater), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM CaCl2 (pH 3.0), 1 mM Na-phytate (Na12C6H6O24P6), and 1 mM Ca-phytate (CaC6H16O24P6). The two organic phosphate compounds were included in the study because of their potential to serve as in-situ immobilizing agents through the formation of insoluble precipitates in association with the contaminant metals.
