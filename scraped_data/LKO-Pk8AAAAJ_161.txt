Information of Cr chemical environments is invaluable for evaluating the efficiency of proposed stabilization technologies. We describe a matrix of Fe and Cr K-edge EXAFS data on synthetic model compounds that have been used to identify different Fe and Cr local environments of two soil samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6312154103808984961", "cites_id": ["6312154103808984961"], "pub_url": "https://jp4.journaldephysique.org/articles/jp4/abs/1997/02/jp4199707C242/jp4199707C242.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gQcP1bZGmVcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 1}}
