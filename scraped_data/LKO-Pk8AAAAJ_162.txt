However, it is unclear if differences in water chemistry influence their effectiveness or whether the presence of Ag in the filtrate (drinking water) impacts the gut microbiome. Using water samples differing markedly in chemical properties, we have found that \u226599.89% of E. coli were killed in all cases, regardless of the water chemistry. However, in the first 25 mL of filtration, concentrations of Ag in most of the water samples (0.14\u201345.2 mg L\u22121) exceeded the limit for drinking water (0.1 mg L\u22121), differing depending upon water chemistry. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis revealed that up to 36% of the Ag in the filter paper was present as AgNO3 and 64% as Ag-NPs, with this AgNO3 likely contributing to the high Ag concentrations in the filtrate. Finally, we also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8101127145410553484", "cites_id": ["8101127145410553484"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/en/c9en01387c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jGZ4ljf8bHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
