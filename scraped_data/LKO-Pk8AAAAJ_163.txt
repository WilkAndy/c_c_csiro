A risk governance approach can be instrumental in achieving balance among diverse stakeholders, as it enables decision-making processes informed by multiple dimensions of risk. This paper applies a risk governance approach to retrospectively examine the development of nanotechnology research and development (R&D) in Australia to identify how risk governance is reflected in the practices of a range of stakeholders. We identify ten risk-related challenges specific to nanotechnology R&D based on a review of the international literature, which provided the foundation for documenting how those working in the Australian nanotechnology sector responded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4225775260978399282", "cites_id": ["4225775260978399282"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-01028-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MkhA8zX4pDoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 4}}
