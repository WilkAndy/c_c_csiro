These techniques enable the study of aqueous solute complexes, poorly crystalline materials, solid-liquid interfaces, mineral-aqueous solution interactions, microbial biofilm-heavy metal interactions, heavy metal-plant interactions, complex material microstructures, and nanomaterials, all of which are important components or processes in the environment. Basic understanding of environmental materials and processes at the molecular scale is essential for risk assessment and management, and reduction of environmental pollutants at field, landscape, and global scales. One of the main purposes of this report is to illustrate the role of synchrotron radiation (SR)-based studies in environmental science and related fields and their impact on environmental problems of importance to society. A major driving force for MES research is the need to characterize, treat, and/or dispose of vast quantities of contaminated materials, including groundwater, sediments, and soils, and to process wastes, at an estimated cost exceeding 150 billion dollars through 2070. A major component of this problem derives from high-level nuclear waste. Other significant components come from mining and industrial wastes, atmospheric pollutants derived from fossil fuel consumption, agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, and the pollution problems associated with animal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10614235834495232707", "cites_id": ["10614235834495232707"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/826756", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w2pPPUFXTZMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
