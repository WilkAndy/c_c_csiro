Four to 10\u2010fold corn grain yield increases resulted from P additions. Broadcast applications of 96 kg P/ha in combination with band treatments of 22 kg P/ha from either diammonium phosphate or ammonium polyphosphate were most efficient in increasing corn grain yields to 80% or more of maximum yield. Critical extractable soil P values for the two sites of 31 and 42, 29 and 37, 18 and 19, and 47 and 43 ppm were obtained for the Bray I, North Carolina (NC), Olsen, and Mehlich III soil test procedures, respectively.
