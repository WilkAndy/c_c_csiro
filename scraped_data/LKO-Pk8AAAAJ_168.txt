Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) composed of materials such as ZnO, TiO2, Ag and CuO are being incorporated into consumer products including sunscreens, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and textiles. The ENMs in these consumer products will be released into waste streams during the products\u2019 life cycles and will concentrate in sewage sludge during wastewater treatment. In areas where biosolids are used as fertilizer, land application of biosolids is a pathway by which ENMs will enter agroecosystems. Furthermore, ENMs are also increasingly being investigated for use in the development of novel pesticides, nutrient delivery systems and fertilizers [1]. These agricultural applications present the possibility of widespread, large volume discharge of as-manufactured ENMs into agroecosystems. As questions remain over the potential environmental impact of ENMs, scientific and community concerns persist over their human and environmental safety.ENMs from consumer products discharged into wastewater will be transformed into aged ENMs prior to being introduced into the environment [2]. The usefulness of data from experiments using pristine ENMs to characterize the risk associated with the discharge of ENMs via this pathway is questionable. Recognizing this, Mallevre et al. examined the toxicity of pristine and aged Ag ENMs to the bioluminescent bacteria Pseudomonas putida [3]. Bacteria were exposed in crude and final wastewater collected from four wastewater treatment plants in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3852241949224411602", "cites_id": ["3852241949224411602"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/6/6/106/htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0iFhjKTpdTUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
