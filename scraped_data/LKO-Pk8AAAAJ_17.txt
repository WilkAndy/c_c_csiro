The primary objective of this study was to assess uptake, biodistribution and toxicity associated with exposure of tobacco plants (Nicotiana xanthi) to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). We employed synchrotron-based X-ray microanalysis with X-ray absorption near-edge microspectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy to localize AuNPs within plants. Results from these experiments reveal that AuNPs entered plants through the roots and moved into the vasculature. Aggregate bodies were also detected within root cell cytoplasm. Furthermore, AuNP uptake was size selective as 3.5 nm AuNP spheres were detected in plants but 18 nm AuNPs remained agglomerated on the root outer surfaces. Finally, leaf necrosis was observed after 14 days of exposure to 3.5 nm AuNPs.
