Reference samples were prepared by reducing varying amounts of structural Fe with Na-dithionite in an inert atmosphere. Analysis of the K \u03b1 X-ray fluorescence near edge structure of reference and TPB-treated samples was accomplished by comparing the ratios of edge crest intensities at energies corresponding to oxidized and dithionite-reduced samples following intensity normalization and energy calibration. About 15% of nontronite structural Fe was reduced during the course of the reaction with TPB, whereas more than 50% of the structural Fe in montmorillonite was reduced.
