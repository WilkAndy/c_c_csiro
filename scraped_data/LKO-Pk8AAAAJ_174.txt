Studies using kinetic reactions of complexation agents with Al have generally supported the existence of at least three Al species coexisting in partially neutralized solutions, representing monomeric (Ala) , polymeric (Alb), and colloidal or precipitated (Alc) Al. Results comparing the ferron assay and 27Al NMR methods have indicate that an Al13 polymer comprises a major portion of the Alb fraction. Thus, the interactions also follow first order kinetics with a corresponding first-order rate constant of 0.037 per min. This rate constant is observed for solutions of low Al concentration, suggesting that the Al13 polymer may be present. These comparisons have also suggested that use of an arbitrary reaction time in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2972846288614730306", "cites_id": ["2972846288614730306"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2972846288614730306&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qiq43PKrQSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 2}}
