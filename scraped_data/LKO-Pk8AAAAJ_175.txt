Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater may provide an early-warning signal of COVID-19 infections in a community. The capacity of the world\u2019s environmental microbiology and virology laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RNA characterization in wastewater is rapidly increasing. However, there are no standardized protocols nor harmonized quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance. This paper is a technical review of factors that can lead to false-positive and-negative errors in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, culminating in recommendations and strategies that can be implemented to identify and mitigate these errors. Recommendations include, stringent QA/QC measures, representative sampling approaches, effective virus concentration and efficient RNA extraction, amplification inhibition assessment, inclusion of sample processing controls, and considerations for RT-PCR assay selection and data interpretation. Clear data interpretation guidelines (eg, determination of positive and negative samples) are critical, particularly during a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Corrective and confirmatory actions must be in place for inconclusive and/or potentially significant results (eg, initial onset or reemergence of COVID-19 in a community). It will also be prudent to perform inter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11897145500955103967", "cites_id": ["11897145500955103967"], "pub_url": "https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/zh/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202104.0481.v1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:39KQocwmG6UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
