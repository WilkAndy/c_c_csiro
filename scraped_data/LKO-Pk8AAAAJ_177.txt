In this project we are investigating the transport, fate, behavior, bioavailability, and effects of MNMs in(to) agroecosystems under environmentally realistic scenarios organized around three key hypotheses: Hypothesis (H1) Surface chemistry is the primary factor influencing the fate and transport of MNMs in the terrestrial environment as well as the bioavailability and effects to biological receptors; Hypothesis (H2) Once released to the environment, pristine MNM surfaces will be modified by interactions with organic and inorganic ligands (macromolecules) or via other biogeochemical transformations (aging effects forming a-MNMs); Hypothesis (H3) Ecoreceptors will respond to interactions with pristine metal and metal oxide MNMs, a-MNMs, and/or dissolved constituent metal ions and bulk oxides by specific ecological and toxicogenomic responses that will reflect their combined effects. The overall objectives are to: O1) Compare the transport, fate, behavior, bioavailability, and effects of MNMs, a- MNMs, and/or dissolved free metals/bulk oxides to organisms with key terrestrial ecosystem functions, as well as exposure pathways involving humans; O2) Determine MNM, surface modified MNM and a-MNM interactions with important biological targets relevant to the BLM and pBRM models and relate these interactions to physicochemical properties; O3) Validate models with information generated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15927786147836111893", "cites_id": ["15927786147836111893"], "pub_url": "https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/20925/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FawoyBzdCt0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
