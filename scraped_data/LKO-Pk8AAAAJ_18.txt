Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to AgNO3 and Ag NPs with similar size ranges coated with either polyvinylpyrrolidone (hydrophilic) or oleic acid (amphiphilic) during a standard sub-chronic reproduction toxicity test. No significant effects on growth or mortality were observed within any of the test treatments. Significant decreases in reproduction were seen in earthworms exposed to AgNO3, (94.21 mg kg-1) as well as earthworms exposed to Ag NPs with either coating (727.6 mg kg-1 for oleic acid and 773.3 mg kg-1 for polyvinylpyrrolidone). The concentrations of Ag NPs at which effects were observed are much higher than predicted concentrations of Ag NPs in sewage sludge amended soils; however, the concentrations at which adverse effects of AgNO3 were observed are similar to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 236, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2125455165397670130", "cites_id": ["2125455165397670130"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17435390.2010.537382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8hiMNzYifx0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 17, "2013": 21, "2014": 24, "2015": 31, "2016": 24, "2017": 26, "2018": 25, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 27, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
