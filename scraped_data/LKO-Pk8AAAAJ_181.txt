Although there is considerable effort associated with gaining initial access, it is useful to keep in mind that most synchrotron X-ray laboratories are funded as user facilities, charged with providing access to the scientific community at-large. Thus, the metric of success and usefulness of a synchrotron radiation laboratory is the scope, amount, and quality of science conducted at the facility. The commissioning of third generation synchrotron X-ray sources over the past several years coupled with decreased federal spending has resulted in a much greater emphasis on user satisfaction, as these facilities try to expand both capabilities and user community to solidify their funding and maintain full operation potential. It has been our experience that the staff of synchrotron research facilities are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11185476410747692477", "cites_id": ["11185476410747692477"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/clays/books/book/1804/chapter-standard/107697605/Obtaining-Access-to-Synchrotron-Based-Techniques", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vaUgSojLOpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1}}
