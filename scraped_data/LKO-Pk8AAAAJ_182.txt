A major obstacle in developing realistic environmental risk assessments or in designing environmentally sound, yet cost effective chemical and biological remediation strategies has been the inability to properly characterise the chemical speciation of contaminants in an environmental sample or waste form. Over the past decade there has been an explosion in applications of synchrotron-based"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4097014412065217455", "cites_id": ["4097014412065217455"], "pub_url": "https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2019-12/nea1727-speciation.pdf#page=81", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r5vNnuaE2zgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1}}
