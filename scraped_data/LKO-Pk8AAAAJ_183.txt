However, few comprehensive data sets exist for critically evaluating the impact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion. Therefore, a series of field-scale experiments using tritiated water (\u00b3H\u2082O), and bromide (Br-) as tracers was conducted on the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site. For each experiment, tracer-free groundwater was injected at a fixed rate of 56.7 L min-1 to establish a forced radial gradient prior to the introduction of a tracer pulse.  After the tracer pulse, the forced gradient was maintained throughout the experiment using non-labeled groundwater. Tracer migration was monitored using six sampling wells radially spaced at approximate distances of 2.0-, 3.0-, and 4.5-m from the injection well. Each sampling well was further divided into three discrete sampling depths that were pumped continuously throughout the course of the experiments. Longitudinal dispersivity (\u03b1L) and travel times for \u00b3H\u2082O were estimated by fitting the field data to analytical approximations of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for uniform and radial flow. Dispersivity varied greatly between wells located at similar transport distances and between zones within a given well. The radial flow equation described \u00b3H\u2082O breakthrough better than the uniform flow solution, yielding lower \u03b1L values while accounting for breakthrough tailing inherent to radial flow conditions. Temporal moment analysis confirmed the retardation of Br-, generally considered to travel in a conservative manner, despite data truncation due to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14537955622464987721", "cites_id": ["14537955622464987721"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14537955622464987721&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SSJr_ZwxwckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
