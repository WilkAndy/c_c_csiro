In 1984 the enclosing spillway of Steed Pond breached, and a pulse of U and Ni contaminated sediments moved downstream, accumulating in Lower Tims Branch (LTB), continuing during storm events. The aim of the study was to correlate fluctuations in contaminant concentrations within annual rings of impacted trees with the contaminant history, specifically the major contaminant pulse of 1984. Trees were sampled at Steed Pond, LTB and an uncontaminated reference site. Their rings were measured, aged and sectioned for SXRF analysis. Analysis took several forms: one-dimensional line scans (from pith to cambium) to show fluctuations in metal concentration over the lifetime of the tree; two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3617948763844404770", "cites_id": ["3617948763844404770"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.B11C0703P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ImaCZDuJNTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
