Synchrotron based X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (SXRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are non-invasive techniques that can be used to examine the distribution and chemical speciation of elements (Z {ge} 20) in moist heterogeneous samples under ambient temperature and pressure. Using a dedicated micro-probe beam line (X-26A) at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Lab, we have conducted spatially resolved XAS studies on a variety of environmental samples and on samples produced in waste isolation and processing activities. Spatially resolved SXRF spectroscopy has been used to generate elemental distribution maps on a 5 {mu}m scale, providing information on elemental distributions and associations. In addition, spatially resolved X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has provided detailed information on the oxidation states of U, Cr, Se, and other metals and metalloids in contaminated soils, biological samples, and in waste forms on regions as small as 40 Pin, with minimal sample manipulation. Furthermore, qualitative information on bonding environments of many of these contaminants has been deduced based upon the {open_quote}fingerprint{close_quote} or multiple scattering regions of the XANES spectra coupled with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11451858863750679750", "cites_id": ["11451858863750679750"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/466497", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xozER_Ys7Z4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1}}
