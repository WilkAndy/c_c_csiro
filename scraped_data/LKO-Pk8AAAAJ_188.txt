This approach provided direct information on the chemical speciation of uranium in micro-regions of contaminated soils and sediments sampled at the Fernald Environmental Management Project Site and the Savannah River Site. Using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, the predominant oxidation state of uranium in the contaminated sediments was determined. A calibration method was developed which enhanced the ability to collect oxidation state information at much lower concentrations in a reasonable time frame and allowed for the generation of oxidation state distribution maps at a 20 {mu}m spatial resolution. Additional experiments conducted on mixed uranium containing mineral phases confirmed the ability of the method to accurately delineate proportions of uranium in different oxidation states. Furthermore, a method of imbedding particles in a nonreactive silicon polymer was developed such that individual particles could be examined before and after extraction with a wide range of chemicals used in sequential extraction techniques and others proposed for chemical intervention technologies. Studies revealed that the sodium carbonate treatment proposed to extract U from soils efficiently removed U(VI), except when present as a phosphate phase, and was inefficient at extracting U(IV) phases. The results of these studies demonstrated the utility of spatially resolved XAS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4465362827551109504", "cites_id": ["4465362827551109504"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/210170", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gPFqSdUn-D0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1}}
