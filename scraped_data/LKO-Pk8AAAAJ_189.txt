The model was compared to nine other geochemical speciation models using an order-of-magnitude comparison statistic. Comparisons were generally favorable with output from most models falling within 1 order of magnitude of MEXAMS output. Model performance was also evaluated. Documentation of model operation was found to be unclear in places and poorly indexed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6042389804208950664", "cites_id": ["6042389804208950664"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0266983886900067", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iA1RUoPh2lMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
