The earthworm Eisenia fetida was exposed to a range of concentrations of AgNO3 and two polyvinylpyrolidone coated Ag NPs with different particle size distributions. They were exposed in two different soils: a naturally occurring sandy loam and a standardized artificial soil. The AgNO3 significantly reduced E. fetida growth and reproduction at 7.41 \u00b1 0.01 mg kg\u22121 Ag in the sandy loam but only reproduction was affected at concentrations of 94.1 \u00b1 3.2 mg kg\u22121 in the artificial soil. In the artificial soil, significant (\u03b1 = 0.05) reproductive toxicity was only observed in organisms exposed to the Ag NPs at concentrations approximately eight times higher than those at which the effects from ionic Ag were observed. Eisenia fetida exposed to either AgNO3 or Ag NPs in the sandy loam accumulated significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) higher \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 236, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10209622425889445445", "cites_id": ["10209622425889445445"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj2010.0127nps", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RZYA4oDdr40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 21, "2013": 24, "2014": 18, "2015": 25, "2016": 24, "2017": 26, "2018": 21, "2019": 10, "2020": 20, "2021": 19, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
