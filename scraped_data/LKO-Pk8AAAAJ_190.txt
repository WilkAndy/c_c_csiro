To assess the potential for 137 Cs remobilization and bioavailability under specific environmental conditions, information on cesium distribution among the various solid phase components is required. The objective of this investigation was to develop a method for estimating the various chemical forms of 137 Cs in sediments employing a sequential selective dissolution (SSD) technique that could be utilized in assessing potential bioavailability. 3 figures, 1 table"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14342635680952129400", "cites_id": ["14342635680952129400"], "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:19017271", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eJf-SSlHC8cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1}}
