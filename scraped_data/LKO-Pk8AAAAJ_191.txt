Quantification of monomeric and polymeric Al species in aqueous solutions ranging in concentration from 3.34 x 10/sup -4/ to 3.34 x 10/sup -2/ M and in OH/Al ratios (n) of 0.25 to 2.50 was made by the NMR technique. The results indicate that single polymeric Al form predominates and is first detectable at n = 0.50 for the 3.34 x 10/sup -2/ M solution. The NMR spectroscopic evidence suggest that the polymer is of the composition (AIO/sub 4/Al/sub 12/(OH)/sub 24/(H/sub 2/O)/sub 12/)/sup 7 +/. The mechanism for its formation is discussed. The chemical assay technique for characterizing hydroxyl-Al solutions was found to be unreliable when used alone. When used in combination with the NMR method, however, two other polymeric species could be identified. The influence of Al exchange equilibria on the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) measurements of five soils was investigated. The ECEC values were found to be at a minimum in the pH range of 4.8 to 5.5. At higher pH values the ECEC values increased concomitantly, resulting from the expression of charge from the constant surface potential soil components. The ECEC values were also found to increase at low pH values or high Al loading rates. The observed transpositions in ECEC were attributed to the shift from exchangeable Al/sup 3 +/ predominance at low pH values, to nonexchangeable forms occupying the interlayers of the chloritized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15898304705935148842", "cites_id": ["15898304705935148842"], "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6009528", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KocvsOUfotwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1}}
