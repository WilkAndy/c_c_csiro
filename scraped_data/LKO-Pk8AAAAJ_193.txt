We argue that one common element is the wealth of basic and applied scientific research that provides the knowledge and tools essential in developing effective programs for addressing threats to humans and social\u2010ecological systems. Research on various chemicals, including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and per\u2010 and polyfluoroalkyl substances, resulted in regulatory action to protect environmental and human health. Moreover, decades of research on coronaviruses, mRNA, and recently SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 enabled the rapid development of vaccines to fight the COVID\u201019 pandemic. In the present study, we explore the common elements of basic and applied scientific research breakthroughs that link chemicals, climate change, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102/COVID\u201019 and describe how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/etc.5542", "cites_per_year": {}}
