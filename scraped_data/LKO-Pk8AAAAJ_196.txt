This facility is operated by the University of Chicago and the University of Kentucky. The facility is available to researchers at both institutions as well as researchers around the globe through the general user program. This facility was successfully supported during the project period. It provided access to advanced X-ray microanalysis techniques which lead to fundamental advances in understanding the behavior of contaminants and geochemistry that is applicable to environmental remediation of DOE legacy sites as well as contaminated sites around the United States and beyond."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1104662", "cites_per_year": {}}
