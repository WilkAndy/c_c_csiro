Information on the transport and fate of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) in the environment and on their potential effects to human and ecological receptors is emerging at an increasing rate. Notwithstanding these developments, the research enterprise focused on the environmental implications of nanotechnology is in its infancy and few unifying principles have yet to emerge. This lack of unanimity is related to many factors including, the vast diversity in chemical composition, size, shape, and surface chemical properties of MNMs, as well as the range of receptor species and cell lines investigated. Additionally, the large variation in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.H11M..01B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
