This element is an important constituent in many inorganic noncarbonate soil minerals. Chemically active soil Al can have a variety of forms that are controlled primarily by the pH and the mineralogical composition of the system. Aluminum concentrations in acid soils may be sufficiently high to be toxic to many plants. This problem may be reduced or totally eliminated by applying a liming agent or by selecting more Al\u2010tolerant plant species, varieties, or both. In general, the initial phase of total Al analysis when Al is to be determined spectrometrically involves fusion and/or complete dissolution of the sample to convert A1 to a soluble form. The involvement of A1 in exchange and soil acidity reactions has received copious attention from researchers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 414, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2481419362500682933", "cites_id": ["2481419362500682933"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/agronmonogr9.2.2ed.c16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tSShWMPFbyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 3, "1986": 8, "1987": 11, "1988": 9, "1989": 10, "1990": 21, "1991": 12, "1992": 18, "1993": 9, "1994": 16, "1995": 14, "1996": 11, "1997": 10, "1998": 18, "1999": 11, "2000": 15, "2001": 9, "2002": 11, "2003": 19, "2004": 10, "2005": 13, "2006": 18, "2007": 8, "2008": 13, "2009": 7, "2010": 10, "2011": 7, "2012": 12, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 14, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 13, "2021": 5, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
