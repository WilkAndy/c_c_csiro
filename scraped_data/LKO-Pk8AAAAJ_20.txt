Hydroxyapatite was added to the sediments at application rates of 0, 5, 15.8, and 50 g kg\u22121 After equilibrating in either 0.02 M KCl or 0.01 M CaCl2, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatants filtered prior to metal, dissolved organic C, and PO4 analyses. The treated soils were then air\u2010dried and changes in solid\u2010phase metal distribution were evaluated using sequential extractions and electron\u2010based microanalysis techniques. Hydroxyapatite was effective at reducing the solubility of U and, to a lesser degree, Ni. Hydroxyapatite was also effective in reducing the solubility of Al, Ba, Cd, Co, Mn, and Pb.
