The purpose of this research is to determine whether treating bacteria with ZON alters protein expression compared to controls. Cupriavidus necator, a common soil bacterium, was grown in nutrient broth containing either 0.1 or 1.0 umol/L zinc as ZON or zinc acetate. The soluble fraction of the cells was isolated for the separation of cytosolic proteins via two\u2010dimensional gel electrophoresis. Twelve proteins exhibited differential expression when the nanoparticle treatments were compared to their respective zinc acetate controls. The proteins ranged in molecular weight from 100 kDa to 10 kDa \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.23.1_supplement.922.3", "cites_per_year": {}}
