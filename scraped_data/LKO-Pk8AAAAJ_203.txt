ZnO-np interactions with clay minerals may have a dominant role in regulating their mobility as well as their potential impacts on biogeochemical processes. This study investigated the sorption behavior of manufactured ZnO-np on a Montmorillonite (Swy-2, Wyoming USA) as referenced against an equivalent concentration of aqueous Zn 2+. Batch sorption experiments were conducted as a function of clay form (parent material and fine fraction), clay amounts (0.25-0.5 g) and initial Zn concentrations (50-200 mg. L-1). Both DDI water and 0.05 M CaCl 2 were tested for their ability to desorb sorbed ZnO-np. Additionally, two different types of cation exchange resins (weakly and strongly acidic) were tested for their interactions with both ZnO-np and ZnCl 2. ZnO-np exhibited a sorption behavior similar to that of a solvated divalent cation held on exchange sites. Nonetheless X-ray powder diffraction results yielded evidence for clay interlayer expansion in presence of ZnO-np with d-spacings around 15.185\u00c5 as compared to 14.367\u00c5 with aqueous ZnCl 2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scisoc.confex.com/crops/2007am/techprogram/P34273.HTM", "cites_per_year": {}}
