The nanotechnology revolution offers great promise for major advances in numerous areas, including medicine, manufacturing, electronics, sensor development, energy production, pollution control, and environmental remediation, among others. Despite the benefits that will undoubtedly result from advances in nanotechnology, concerns surrounding the potential negative impacts to the environment and human health have emerged. We have been investigating the bioavailability and toxicity as well as the trophic transfer of ZnO and Au nanoparticles to microorganisms, detritivores, amphibians, and plants. Interdisciplinary studies include the characterization of the nanoparticles, the distribution of nanoparticles in biological tissues, nanoparticle toxicity as referenced to the free metal ion concentration, and gene expression associated with nanoparticle exposure. The results demonstrate the importance of characterization of nanoparticles under varying chemical conditions associated with exposure media and that nanoparticles are toxic to microorganisms and nematodes. The results also suggest a different spatial distribution in tissues as well as a unique toxicity mechanism compared to the free metal ion concentration. Ongoing studies are evaluating the propensity for nanoparticles to be transferred from one trophic level to the next by feeding pre-exposed microorganisms (B. vietnamensis) to the nematode, C. elegans and pre-exposed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scisoc.confex.com/crops/2007am/techprogram/P31464.HTM", "cites_per_year": {}}
