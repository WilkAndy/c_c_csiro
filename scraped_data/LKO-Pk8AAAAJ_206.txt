However, few comprehensive data sets exist for evaluating the impact of travel distance and site heterogeneity on solute dispersion under non-uniform flow conditions. In addition, anionic tracers are often used to estimate physical transport parameters based on an erroneous assumption of conservative (ie, non-reactive) behavior. Therefore, a series of field experiments using tritiated water and several other commonly used hydrologic tracers (Br, Cl, FBAs) were conducted in the water-table aquifer on the US Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (Aiken, SC) to evaluate solute transport processes in a diverging radial flow field. For each experiment, tracer-free groundwater was injected for approximately 24 hours at a fixed rate of 56.7 L/min (15 gpm) to establish a forced radial gradient prior to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFM.H23I..03S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
