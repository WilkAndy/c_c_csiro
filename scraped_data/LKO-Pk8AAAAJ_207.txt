Steed Pond is an abandoned farm pond that served as a settling basin on the Savannah River Site, Aiken, SC (Batson, 1994). Soil toxicity tests, using Lumbricus terrestris and Eisenia foetida were carried on Tims Branch soils to assess bioavailability of metals and radionuclides. Total dissolution data showed high concentrations of Ni and U within the soil, with relatively more Ni than U bound to readily exchangeable fractions. Data showed elevated U and Ni concentrations compared to worms from an uncontaminated reference soil. Metal toxicity in these contaminated soils was further confirmed by in vitro nematode bioassays (Caenorrhabditis elegans), which showed 95-100% lethality. These results, and those from on-going earthworm toxicity bioassays (EPA# OPPTS 850.6200) are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11290722929564420014&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rocLAq-0sJwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
