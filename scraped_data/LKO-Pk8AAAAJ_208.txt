The three-day event (May 4 through May 6) featured a wide variety of workshops, scientific talks, posters, vendor exhibits, and social events. This gathering of over 600 registered participants was perhaps the largest annual meeting ever of any synchrotron organization. The chair of the APS Users Organization, Steve Durbin (Purdue University), welcomed this group by congratulating them for becoming the largest user group of any US DOE facility (over 2,600 badged members), for leading the world in producing new protein structures, for being on track to lead in the number of peerreviewed publications among synchrotrons, and especially for having written far more letters to Congress in the last year than all other DOE light source users combined. After a gracious welcome by Argonne Director Hermann Gr\u00fcnder, the session was turned over to Ellen Burns \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08940880408603107", "cites_per_year": {}}
