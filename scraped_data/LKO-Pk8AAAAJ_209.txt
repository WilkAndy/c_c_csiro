Soils widely distributed in this physiographic unit are characterized by highly weathered, deep coarse textured vadose zones, located on mature landscapes. Furthermore, soil types common in the upper coastal plain (UCP) region have strong similarities to soils widely distributed in watersheds of the Amazon Basin. Thus, an understanding of the biogeochemical dynamics controlling carbon fluxes in these systems has significant implications for natural resource management of large land areas and for the potential to enhance C-sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere. We have examined the distributions of lipids in vertical profiles in upland soils within the UCP. Our results showed that biogenic hydrocarbons, fatty acids, and aliphatic alcohols decreased with increasing depth within \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.B51C0979M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
