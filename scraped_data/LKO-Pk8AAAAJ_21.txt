To evaluate the roles of natural organic materials and pore water velocity on mobile colloid generation, colloids generated from 14-m1* 3 lysimeters containing reconstructed soil profiles were collected and characterized. Colloids generated during low flow rates were 1030% less abundant, contained at least65% more iron oxides and gibbsite, were 80% smaller, and had 40% greater electrophoretic mobility thancolloids generated during higher flow rates. Quartz, kaolinite, and hydroxyinterlayered vermiculite were enriched by at least 32% in colloids generated during faster flow rates. Mobile colloid surface charge was greatly enhanced by organic carbon (OC) coatings. Concentrations of OC associated with mobile colloids were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13731185825279947874", "cites_id": ["13731185825279947874"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00043a021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YrSw1MH4jr4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 5, "1997": 7, "1998": 9, "1999": 10, "2000": 8, "2001": 6, "2002": 11, "2003": 12, "2004": 8, "2005": 6, "2006": 9, "2007": 13, "2008": 12, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
