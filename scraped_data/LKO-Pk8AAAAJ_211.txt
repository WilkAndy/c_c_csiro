Although there exists a substantial body of literature pertaining to the fate, distribution, and bioavailability of contaminant metals in model laboratory systems, few studies have examined the biogeochemical cycling of heavy metals in complex aged-contaminated soils and sediments at a fundamental level. Even fewer have coupled detailed information on chemical speciation from state-of-the-art microscopic analytical and spectroscopic techniques with macroscopic observations obtained using indirect chemical extractions, metal desorption and leaching experiments, and biological uptake and toxicity assays."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/836464", "cites_per_year": {}}
