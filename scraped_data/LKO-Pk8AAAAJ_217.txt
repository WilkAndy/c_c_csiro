For co-contaminated systems, the presence of heavy metals at excessive levels may alter the structure and function of microbial communities that are essential for the immobilization of inorganics and degradation of organic contaminants. We examined riparian sediments heavily contaminated with U and Ni (1000's of mg/kg) from a small stream on the US Department of Energy's Savannah River Site that received metallurgical process effluents wastewater over a thirty-year period associated with the production of nuclear materials. Four gram positive bacteria were isolated that displayed marked resistance (5000 mg/kg) to Ni relative to organisms from uncontaminated control locations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AGUFM.B11B0726S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
