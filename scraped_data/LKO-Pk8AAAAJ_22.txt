Micaceous minerals and their weathering products are the most important source of plant\u2010available potassium in a soil system. Parent material, mineral and soil weathering, and cropping patterns all exert an influence on soil potassium levels, which in turn are reflective of the soil potassium status. That fraction of potassium available to plants, however, is dependent on the dynamics existing between the various potassium\u2010bearing phases and, perhaps more important, the rate of transfer between these phases. Specialty crops such as vegetables and tobacco are always first to receive potassium, both because of high requirements and because the high investment made makes the cost of potassium \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2029801519286159529", "cites_id": ["2029801519286159529"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/1985.potassium.c7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qYiZObpNKxwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 4, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 6, "1997": 7, "1998": 4, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 11, "2014": 8, "2015": 8, "2016": 21, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 12, "2020": 6, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
