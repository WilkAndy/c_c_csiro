Because these compounds are not readily adsorbed by poultry, As in poultry litter can reach concentrations> 41 mg/kg, which, for comparison, is the maximum allowable concentration for land application of sewage sludge according to USEPA 503 regulations. In contrast to land application of sewage sludge or industrial by-products such as fly ash, the potential for As loading of soil from poultry litter application has received little attention, despite the more prevalent use of poultry litter as a soil amendment. Furthermore, little is known concerning the biogeochemistry of these organo-arsenic compounds in soils. In incubation studies, we found that soil solution As concentrations were higher for poultry litter amendments when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AGUSM...H61C09J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
