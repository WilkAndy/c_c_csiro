Goldschmidt Conference", "volume": "1", "abstract": "A fundamental understanding of interactions at the molecular level is required to explain the mechanisms controlling the fate and transport of solutes and contaminants in soil and subsurface environments. However, there has been limited success in translating information generated at the molecular level to explain observations made at larger scales. While several explanations for this conundrum can be advanced, a prominent one is that much of our knowledge concerning the surface chemistry of clay and oxide minerals is derived from experiments conducted on model monomineralic phases. Results from these studies have helped to establish boundary conditions defining surface complexation reactions of contaminants and to delineate reactive surface functional groups for a range of mineral phases. However, it has been difficult to successfully extrapolate this information to explain reactivity in heterogeneous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/gold2001/pdf/3437.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
