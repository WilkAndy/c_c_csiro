The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential toxicological effects of manufactured zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO\u2010NPs; 1.5 nm) compared to aqueous zinc chloride (ZnCl2) in the free\u2010living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Toxicity of both types of Zn was investigated using the ecologically relevant endpoints of lethality, behavior, reproduction, and transgene expression in a mtl\u20102::GFP (gene encoding green fluorescence protein fused onto the metallothionein\u20102 gene promoter) transgenic strain of C. elegans. Zinc oxide nanoparticles showed no significant difference from ZnCl2 regarding either lethality or reproduction in C. elegans, as indicated by their median lethal concentrations (LC50s; p = 0.29, n = 3) and median effective concentrations (EC50s; Z = 0.835, p = 0 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13111426383876420286", "cites_id": ["13111426383876420286"], "pub_url": "https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1897/08-262.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vnKjLdQk9bUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 8, "2011": 14, "2012": 24, "2013": 24, "2014": 23, "2015": 14, "2016": 21, "2017": 14, "2018": 19, "2019": 13, "2020": 20, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
