Three brownstock pulp samples were chelated, acidified, or bleached. The low concentrations of residual Fe and Ca required that synchrotron-generated x-rays be used to analyze the metal ions. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis for the oxidation state of the intractable Fe suggested that it existed as a mixture of Fe (2+) and Fe (3+). Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis indicated that this iron was most likely bound to lignin structures via two oxygen bonds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3913144705294789077&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1enLcWBITjYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
