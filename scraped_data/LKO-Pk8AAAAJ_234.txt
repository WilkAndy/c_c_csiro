Funding organisation: USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)(United States)", "abstract": "Research ObjectiveCesium (137) is a major component of high level weapons waste. At Hanford, single shell tanks (SST's) with high level wastes (HLW) have leaked supernate containing over 106 Ci of 137Cs and other co-contaminants into the vadose zone. In select locations, 137Cs has migrated further than expected from retardation experiments and performance assessment calculations. Deep137Cs migration has been observed beneath the SX tank farm at Hanford with REDOX wastes as the carrier causing regulatory and stakeholder concern. The causes for\" expedited\" migration are unclear. This research is investigating how the sorption chemistry of Cs on Hanford vadose zone sediments changes after contact with solutions characteristic of HLW. Our central scientific hypothesis is that the high Na concentration of HLW will suppress surface-exchange reactions of Cs, except those to highly-selective frayed edge sites (FES) of the micaceous fraction. We further speculate that the concentrations, ion selectivity, and structural aspects of the FES will change after contact with HLW and that these changes will be manifest in the macroscopic sorption behavior of Cs. We believe that migration predictions of Cs can be improved substantially if such changes are understood and quantified."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:31003422", "cites_per_year": {}}
