Due to the many difficulties associated with obtaining high quality XAFS data on these systems, a custom-manufactured 5 mil thick Sc foil was used in conjunction with a Soller slit assembly to improve the XAFS signal to noise ratio by almost a factor of 6. XAFS analyses of the Cs-DI8C6 solution show the presence of a 1: 1 Cs-DI8C6 complex with the Br counter-ion still in contact with the Cs atom. These results are consistent with previous wet chemical studies.
