We have used the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) technique to investigate the local structure of {sup 133}Cs+-dibenzo-18-crown-6 ether complexes in non-aqueous solution and powder forms. Analyses of solution complexes indicates contact pairing as e compared to non-contact (i.e. solvent separated) pairing of the Cs-crown ether complexes with the halide anion to form ternary complexes. Recrystallization of the complexes to the solid form resulted in the redistribution of Cs-halide salt as a distinct phase from the crown ether. These data illustrate the importance of direct measurement of solution phase chemical speciation without sample modification."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/214980", "cites_per_year": {}}
