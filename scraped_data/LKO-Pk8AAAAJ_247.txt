A difficulty with studying and modeling this contaminant transport process has been in defining clearly whether the contaminants exist in the mobile-solid (colloidal) or mobile-aqueous phase. Traditionally, researchers have assumed that contaminants were in the colloidal fraction when differences in contaminant concentrations of ultrafiltrates were measured (2, 3). This technique is not entirely satisfactory because it provides only indirect evidence, is subject to a number of artifacts, and usually requires high analytical precision at very low contaminant concentrations (I, 2, 4, 5). The Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) microprobe at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, may provide a means for distinguishing between contaminants in the aqueous or solid phase. SXRF is a powerful, nondestructive analytical technique that has detection limits generally between 0.1 and 10 mg kg-*(6-8), The sensitivity of SXRF is generally poor for elements with atomic numbers less than 17 (< 3 keV) because of absorption by air and Be windows, low photoionization cross-sections, and high selfabsorption (7). The synchrotron-generated X-ray beam penetrates tens of micrometers through a sample and is highly collimated, having a typical diameter at the sample of about 10 pm.Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis is also a nondestructive analytical technique used to determine the chemical composition of solid surfaces, but instead of using a photon beam, as does SXRF \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=425727534897312274&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EjKo-O986AUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
