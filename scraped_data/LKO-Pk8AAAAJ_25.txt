The amount of Al13 polymer formed in solutions ranging in Al concentration from 3.34 \u00d7 10\u22124 to 3.34 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 was found to be highly dependent on OH/Al ratio (\u00f1), neutralization rate, mixing conditions, and initial Al concentration. For the 3.34 \u00d7 10\u22123 mol Al L\u22121 solution synthesized at 1.2 cm3 min\u22121, the Al13 polymer formed only when \u00f1 exceeded 1.5, whereas this polymer predominated in a solution 3.34 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 with respect to Al at \u00f1 \u22650.4. There was no evidence for Al13 polymer formation in solutions \u22643.34 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol Al L\u22121 with \u00f1 = 2.5 synthesized at the 1.2 cm3 min\u22121 base injection rate; however, the formation of this species could be induced in the 3.34 \u00d7 10\u22124 mol Al L\u22121 solution by increasing the base injection \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 212, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=498134431340152332", "cites_id": ["498134431340152332"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100030046x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DMZrRqC66QYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 6, "1990": 8, "1991": 5, "1992": 11, "1993": 7, "1994": 9, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 6, "1999": 8, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 9, "2004": 11, "2005": 9, "2006": 8, "2007": 17, "2008": 10, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 9, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
