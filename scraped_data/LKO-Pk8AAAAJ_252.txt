The authors' investigations have utilized high resolution multi-NMR spectroscopy to investigate the chemical speciation of cations on mineral and biological surfaces and to provide information on the dynamics of sorbed cations and nonionic organic contaminants (NOC) associated with a variety of mode exchanger, mineral, and humic phases (NOM). Direct measurements of the transverse and longitudinal relaxation components of the (ad) sorbed quadropolar nuclei (27 Al, 133 Cs, and 2 H) have allowed the estimation of both rotational correlation times (\u03c4c) and quadrupolar coupling constants (\u03c7), which provide information about the specificity of interaction and symmetry within the various surface environments"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:26004648", "cites_per_year": {}}
