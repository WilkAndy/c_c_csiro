To date, no power plants in Georgia have installed stack scrubbers for the removal of sulfur dioxide gas during coal combustion; however, beginning in 1995, the electrical utilities will have to reduce sulfur emissions under the Clean Air Act (Reisch, 1992). This will lead to the production of flue-gas desulfurization gypsum (FGJXi.) as an additional by-product. land application has been proposed as a disposal option for fly ash and flue-gas gypsum; however, there is some concern that heavy metals found in the ash may pollute surface water or leach into groundwater. High levels of soluble boron found in the fly ash have been shown to cause toxicity problems for plants under greenhouse conditions (Ciravolo and Adriano, 1979). In spite of the potential hazard associated with fly ash usage, alkaline ash has been shown to be an effective liming agent for increasing soil pH (Adriano et al., 1980). Additionally, gypsum has been shown to ameliorate chemical and physical limitations associated with the highly weathered soils of the southeast (Shainberg et al., 1989). Ultisols in Georgia display improved plant-water relations and a decrease in root penetration resistance following gypsum application. Gypsum also decreases exchangeable acidity and increases available calcium. The solubility of flue-gas gypsum is similar to or greater than that of phosphogypsum and thus may be a more effective soil amendment than phosphogypsum or mined gypsum.
