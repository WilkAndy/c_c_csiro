Knowledge of chemical bonding and of the atomic-level structure of crystalline and non-crystalline solids and of surface-sorbed and soluble species is essential for accurate prediction of the response of soils and natural aqueous systems to environmental perturbations such as fertilization, waste disposal, or treatment of contaminated soil and waters.X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), and anomalous scattering methods can provide element-specific information about bonding and structure in both homogeneous and heterogeneous samples. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) reveals the local atomic arrangement around each type of atom, including average coordination numbers, bond lengths, and bond angles. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) can provide information about symmetry, bonding, and oxidation state of an element (see Chapter 3, this report). X-ray emission spectroscopy may be used to elucidate the electron states that contribute to bonding in minerals or at mineral surfaces. Differential anomalous scattering (DAS), in which the difference between the scattering amplitudes at two energies is measured, yields medium-range, elementspecific structural information."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/6603566#page=47", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tlMUY4lUcVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
