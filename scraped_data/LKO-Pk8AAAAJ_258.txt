Traditionally, soils have been relied on to help produce food and fiber. More recently, environmental concerns have increased, and the importance of soils in controlling ground-water pollution, safe use of pesticides, and nuclear waste storage has become evident. Modification and control of soil physical behavior to improve streets, roads, and airports continues to be important.The behavior of soils is controlled, to a large extent, by constituent minerals that have special sets of properties developed in the soil weathering environment. Clay minerals in soils have adsorbed hydroxy-aluminum polymers that influence their chemical and physical properties. The oxides of iron and manganese in soils have foreign ions substituted in their structures that influence their behavior, influence crystal growth, and fingerprint the geochemical environment in which they formed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/22/002/22002947.pdf#page=77", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2PeMXdKgJAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
