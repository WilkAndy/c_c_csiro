Unless solution free of colloidal material is required, it is best to define DOM as the OM dissolved in soil solution which passes a 0.45\u2010\u03bcm filter. Water soluble OM (WSOM) is the fraction of soil OM extracted with water or a dilute salt solution that passes a 0.45 \u03bcm or other appropriate filter. WSOM is extracted with water or aqueous solution. When studying DOM biogeochemistry, it is useful to choose a fractionation technique based on important physiochemical properties related to the biogeochemical process of interest Solubility or OM in different extractants has often been used as the basis of fractionation. Three techniques have been used to fractionate soil derived DOM and WSOM \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 211, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1793627014076797571", "cites_id": ["1793627014076797571"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/1995.carbonforms.c5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g5KXKUQ-5BgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 6, "2001": 13, "2002": 9, "2003": 14, "2004": 10, "2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 10, "2008": 10, "2009": 10, "2010": 11, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 9, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
