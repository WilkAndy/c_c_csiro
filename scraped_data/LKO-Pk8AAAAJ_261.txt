DOE Report SRO--819-17(1986). p 38-42, 3 fig.", "abstract": "Total metal concentrations in the water column provide little predictive information concerning possible detrimental impacts on the environment, although current regulations for effluent discharge are based on these criteria. Rather, for many metals the chemical form of the dissolved constituent determines its relative toxicity. In addition, the partitioning of metals between solid and dissolved phases via adsorption and desorption processes also depends on metal speciation, and it is this partitioning that largely controls transport. In an attempt to provide predictive capabilities and better understand the transport of heavy metals and radionuclides in Savannah River Plant (SRP) aquatic systems, the chemical speciation-transport model MEXAMS (Metal Exposure Analysis Modeling System) has been implemented and is being tailored for site-specific application to SRP aquatic systems.
