The absence of well defined principles in this area has resulted from a lack of consensus on the nature of hydrolytic Al reactions in aqueous solution. The general objectives were to study the reactions of Al in various complex solutions employing a quantitative (''27) Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique and to further investigate the role of Al in the exchange equilibria of soils.Quantification of monomeric and polymeric Al species in aqueous solutions ranging in concentration from 3.34 x 10 (''-4) to 3.34 x 10 (''-2) M and in OH/Al ratios (n) of 0.25 to 2.50 was made by the NMR technique. The results indicate that single polymeric Al form predominates and is first detectable at n= 0.50 for the 3.34 x 10 (''-2) M solution.
