It is abundant in nature and occurs in considerable total amounts in most soils. Forms of potassium available for plant uptake, however, are often deficient in soils. This new book Potassium in Agriculture is a greatly expanded revision of The Role of Potassium in Agriculture published by ASA-CSSA-SSSA in 1968. The new book brings together technical authors from a wide range of disciplines and areas around the world to present a coherent and authoritative treatise. The book chapters are an example of both the depth and breadth of expertise available in modern science and how this can be focused on a single topic."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/1985.potassium", "cites_per_year": {}}
