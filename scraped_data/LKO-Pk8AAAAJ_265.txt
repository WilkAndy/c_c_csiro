Scientists from many disciplines use this knowledge in fundamental and adaptive research on soil erosion, weathering, classification, fertility, physics, chemistry, and biochemistry, as well as in the engineering aspects of soils. A critical new use is the application of this knowledge to waste-related environmental problems including toxic waste cleanup and landfill siting.The need for additional information on specific mineral groups, as well as the availability of additional significant research results led to a series of symposia sponsored by Division S-9 of SSSA in 1984 and 1985 and a complete revising of Minerals in Soil Environments. This revision has much new material and greatly expanded coverage of surface chemistry, mineral \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssabookser1.2ed", "cites_per_year": {}}
