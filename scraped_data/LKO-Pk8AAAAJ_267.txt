BERTSCH was born in Wilmington, DE, and grew up in Wilton, CT. In 1978 he graduated with honors from the Univ. of Connecticut with a BS in plant science. He then accepted a research fellowship from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. where he received the MS degree in soil science under the direction of Dr. MM Alley and LW Zelazny in 1980. Results from his MS research on lime\u2014aluminum interactions and phosphorus relations in Coastal Plain soils resulted in a change to the soil test P recommendations for newly cleared land in Virginia and also introduced him to the complex and elusive area of soil aluminum chemistry. He decided to pursue this area for his dissertation research and accepted a graduate research fellowship at the Univ. of Kentucky to work with Dr. GW Thomas and RI Barnhisel, recognized authorities in the areas of soil Al chemistry and mineralogy, respectively.In Jan \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14988952858602252988&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
