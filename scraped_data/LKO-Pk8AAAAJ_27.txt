Furthermore, the development of environmentally sound yet cost-effective remediation strategies requires an understanding of the chemical speciation of the contami-nants within the soil or sediment matrix in which they are contained. Owing to analytical difficulties, traditional methods for determining speciation of metals in soils and sediments have relied heavily on indirect chemical extrac-tion techniques, in which various phases within the matrix are operationally defined and inferences on chemical associations are generated (1-3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 192, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7787416296243596707", "cites_id": ["7787416296243596707"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00054a034", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ow2wp9x1EmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 7, "1996": 7, "1997": 9, "1998": 11, "1999": 16, "2000": 13, "2001": 10, "2002": 13, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 13, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
