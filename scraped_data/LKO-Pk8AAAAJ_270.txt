Tritium breakthrough illustrated the heterogeneous nature of the subsurface system, suggesting that despite the coarse texture of the Coastal Plain Sediments, groundwater flow rates varied dramatically within certain regions of the aquifer. In addition, tritium breakthrough in replicate studies using similar injection rates and tracer volumes was essentially identical and differed dramatically from the transport behavior observed for anionic tracers, such as bromide (Br) and chloride (Cl), often considered conservative (ie non-reactive) in groundwater transport studies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://gwri.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/files/docs/1997/SeamanJ-97.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_ODrTLSzyGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
