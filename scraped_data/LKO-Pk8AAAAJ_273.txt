Chapter 5 Silver sulfide nanoparticles eliminate the stimulative effects of earthworms on nutrient uptake by soybean in high organic matter soils", "citation": "Fate and behaviour of silver nanoparticles in terrestrial ecosystems, 172, 0", "author": "Jingtao Wu and Cui Li and Neal W Menzies and Paul M Bertsch and Peng Wang and Peter M Kopittke", "journal": "Fate and behaviour of silver nanoparticles in terrestrial ecosystems", "pages": "172", "abstract": "There is a gap of knowledge for the fate and behaviour of nanoparticles in soilearthworm-plant systems. Moreover, little is known about the effects of soil organic matter on the bioavailability of Ag2S-NPs (as the environmentally relevant form of Ag-NPs) to plants. In this study, the bioavailability of Ag2S-NPs in two soils with different organic matter content with and without earthworms was evaluated. Results demonstrate that Ag2S-NPs are readily to transform to Ag-NPs in the soil solution of high organic matter soil, leading to the higher bioaccessibility to soybean compared to the soil low in low organic matter. The interaction between earthworms and organic matter effectively increased the bioavailability of Ag. In addition, the stimulative effects of earthworms on plant nutrient uptake were eliminated by Ag2S-NPs. In the presence of earthworm, lower concentrations of plant tissue Cu, Fe, and P were found in the high organic matter soil amended with Ag2S-NPs compared to the soil without earthworms. Importantly, in the presence of earthworms, Ag2S-NPs decreased the relative abundance of the nutrient cycling-related phylum of Chloroflexi, while they increased relative abundance of the tolerant bacteria belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes. These results provide valuable information for understanding the biological and biochemical impacts of Ag2S-NP exposure on earthworm functions of plant nutrient acquisition."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13218603172488850930&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8q0M24zpcbcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
