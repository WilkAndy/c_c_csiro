On tuff and synthetic pyrolusite (Mn IV O2), Pu (IV) or Pu (V) was initially oxidized, but over time Pu (IV) became the predominant oxidation state of sorbed Pu. Reduction of Pu (V/VI), even on non-oxidizing surfaces, is proposed to result from a lower Gibbs free energy of the hydrolyzed Pu (IV) surface species versus that of the Pu (V) or Pu (VI) surface species. This work suggests that despite initial oxidation of sorbed Pu by oxidizing surfaces to more soluble forms, the less mobile form of Pu, Pu (IV), will dominate Pu solid phase speciation during long term geologic storage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/68172123/Plutonium_Oxidation_and_Subsequent_Reduc20210718-18665-5erc5e.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p2OyfUO2sBIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
