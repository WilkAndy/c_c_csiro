Most of these Ag NPs will be to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and ultimately will reside in the biosolids leaving the plant, half of which will be deposited to croplands. In order to compare the speciation behavior of Ag NPs and Ag+ both sources of Ag were exposed for 2 weeks to biosolid and analyzed for Ag-speciation using synchrotron extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) linear combination fitting (LCF). In the majority of cases the Ag NPs were completely sulfidized; any unsulfidized fraction was the original Ag. In contrast, added Ag-ion was only partially transformed to Ag2S, reacted with acetate and sulfhydryl groups, and a portion remained as unreacted Ag+. It is presumed that the Ag ion, which is much more readily available when added as AgNC> 3 than as Ag NPs had a deleterious effect on the sulfate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/09d654fccd650aa987e37e0bb103c1c3/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750#page=89", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jNBuCKO2Q6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
