The clay mineralogy of the surface soil consisted primarily of kaolinite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, and gibbsite, while the dominant clay mineralogy of the subsurface materials consisted of kaolinite, goethite, and mica (illite).Repacked columns of the four differing strata were leached with tritiated (= 200 pCi mLT\") Bromide solutions, either MgBr, or KBr, of varying ionic strengths (0.1-0.001 N). Pore-water velocities estimated by bulk density and mass flux were consistent with those estimated from tritium breakthrough. In contrast, BrT breakthrough differed drastically within the four materials and was altered by experimental conditions (sample drying, carrier \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/50027049/Physicochemical_Controls_on_Nonconservat20161101-13059-18314j1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uuJVgp3Po1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
