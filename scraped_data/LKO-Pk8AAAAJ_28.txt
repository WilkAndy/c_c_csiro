The result is that synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) has become a mainstream technique in a number of scientific disciplines and is providing molecular-level information not previously available using other techniques. The XAFS spectrum is typically separated into the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), also known as the near-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) region, and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region. The XANES or NEXAFS spectrum is represented by the energy region just below to\u223c 50 eV above the absorption edge and serves as a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3361362165858555176", "cites_id": ["3361362165858555176"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr990070s", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KNVvoRT1pS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 6, "2003": 12, "2004": 10, "2005": 9, "2006": 9, "2007": 10, "2008": 8, "2009": 11, "2010": 13, "2011": 15, "2012": 11, "2013": 15, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
