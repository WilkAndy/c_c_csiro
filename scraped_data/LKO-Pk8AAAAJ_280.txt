The emergence of new powerful tools for examining nanoscale materials over the past one and a half decades has also spawned great interest in the occurrence, distribution, and properties of nanoscale mineral phases in terrestrial and aquatic systems and their role in facilitating/directing coupled biogeochemical processes that are critical for elemental cycling and contaminant fate and behaviour."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/79383350/S1-01_20Bertsch.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IyjGAjNeTM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
