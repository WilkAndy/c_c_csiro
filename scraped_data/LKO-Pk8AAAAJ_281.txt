To examine Pu sorption on a natural surface at a microscopic scale, we measured the coordination and bonding environment of sorbed Pu on zeolitic tuff from Yucca Mountain (YM) with microprobe x-ray imaging and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Using a focused 4x7 mm2 beam, micro-EXAFS spectra were acquired at Mn-rich smectitic regions with high levels of sorbed Pu. Plutonium sorption was not observed at Fe-rich or zeolitic-rich regions. The YM tuff is predominantly zeolitic with approximately 2% smectite, according to characterization studies of the core material. 1 The smectite isolates were rich in the mineral rancieite (Ca, Mn2+)(Mn4 4+ O9\u2022 3H2O), which has a similar structure to birnessite, though is more rich in Mn (IV) than typical birnessite. Electron microprobe, microautoradiography, and petrographic studies indicate Pu sorbs more strongly to smectite and Mn-oxide fracture minerals than to Fe oxides or zeolites. 2 Previous studies demonstrated the Pu (V) added at two regions was present as Pu (V) or as Pu (VI), based on the energy at the half-height of the Pu XANES edge step. 1 Preliminary analyses of the micro-EXAFS spectra at these locations indicate the absence of a 1st shell splitting of axial and equatorial Pu-O bonds. 3 Absence of a\" split\" first shell in the EXAFS data for Pu does not conform to bonding environments that are traditionally associated with pentavalent and hexavalent or\" actinyl\" species. Additionally, micro-XAFS spectra indicate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www-stg.aps.anl.gov/sites/www.aps.anl.gov/files/APS-sync/activity_reports/apsar2000/duff1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h0vtbrKCxtUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
