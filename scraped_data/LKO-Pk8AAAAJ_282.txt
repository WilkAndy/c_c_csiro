At low levels, Se is an essential element, yet at higher concentrations, toxicity is often manifest in plants and animals. The essential nature of Se derives from the Se amino acid Se-cysteine, which is the active site in a number of enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and formate dehydrogenase [1]. By contrast, one proposed mechanism for the toxicity of Se is the indiscriminate substitution of the nonessential Se amino acid, Semethionine, for methionine during protein synthesis, which subsequently affects protein structure and function. Previous studies have implicated Se in the ecotoxicology of organisms inhabiting wetlands contaminated with coal combustion waste (CCW)[2, 3]. We are currently conducting synchrotron x-ray fluorescence (SXRF), x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies in Se-rich regions in organisms exposed to CCW to fully elucidate Se coordination environments [4]. The ability to examine tissues of organisms from different trophic levels in situ will allow us to test an emerging hypothesis that the biotransformation of Se into proteinaceous forms controls its biomagnification [5]. Furthermore, we hope to provide specific structural data to confirm the ex situ identification of a previously uncharacterized Se-S bridged selenoamino acid in Se-rich biological tissues [6]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.aps.anl.gov/sites/www.aps.anl.gov/files/APS-sync/activity_reports/apsar2002/JACKSON1.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FtKZdC4qtMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
