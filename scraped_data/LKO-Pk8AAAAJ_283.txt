However, the ability to probe elemental compositions at the m scale also demonstrated substantial heterogeneous partitioning of U and Ni in sediments. Similar results were reported previously for lower resolution mapping of intact soil particles with 50 to 300 m beam sizes [2, 3]. Frequently, U and Ni associations were mutually exclusive, ie, U was associated with organic matter while Ni was associated with non-organic Fe-rich regions (Fig. 1). In other cases, U and Ni hotspots were spatially correlated. Observations of intact organic structures not enriched in anthropogenic metals, presumably root cross-sections, suggest a strong link between the degradation of organic matter and contaminant partitioning.Acknowledgments: We thank A.
