Credible risk assessments are needed to define and manage the underlying human health and ecological risk, and scientific understanding is needed to develop and implement novel remediation strategies, as well as to gain regulator and stakeholder acceptance of these approaches. Experience at the Department of Energy\u2019s Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina has demonstrated that a strong scientific program can have significant consequences in terms of providing input to the remediation process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.wmsym.org/archives/2004/pdfs/4445.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9NdRGhOZO3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
