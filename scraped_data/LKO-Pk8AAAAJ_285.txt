To assess the environmental risks linked to the use of these materials, it is essential to study of the physico-chemical stability of these metals in hydrated hydraulic binders. Hydration of cements lead to the dissolution of the primary cement phases followed by the precipitation of new hydrated phases. Thus, the metals trapped in the anhydrous phases are also dissolved. Standard leaching tests performed on cements manufactured with hazardous waste have revealed low levels of soluble metals; however, the total metal release was dependent on cement and secondary hydrate phase composition [1]. Thus, to predict the long-term metal leaching behavior and associated environmental and human health risks associated with metal release, it is crucial to determine the crystallographic sites of the heavy metals in the clinker.Our recent studies [2-5] coupling different spectroscopic techniques (NMR, XAS) enabled us to determine the crystallographic site of Pb and Zn in cement during a separate hydration of each phase constituting a cement. Lead has a high affinity for calcium silicate and ferro-aluminate phases (hydrated C3S and hydrated C4AF). In the case of the hydration of C3S, lead is incorporated within the matrix of the new mineral (CSH for Calcium Silicate Hydrates) through Si-O-Pb linkages [2-4]. In the case of hydrated C4AF Pb is directly linked to the mineral and Fe-O-Pb linkages have been detected [2]. For these two phases and due to the low Pb \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/22165/rose9797.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v8hYxzvMcCwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
