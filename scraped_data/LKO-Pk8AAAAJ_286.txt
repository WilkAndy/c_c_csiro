X-ray microprobe based techniques, noted for minimal sample preparation and non-invasiveness, are no exception. Perturbation of analyte oxidation state is particularly problematic since this information is often the object of measurements via X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The linear relationship between the U LBIIIB absorption edge position and proportion of U (VI) to U (IV) and the 4 eV difference between U (VI) and U (IV) edge positions provide a useful and sensitive approach for quantitatively determining uranium redox status via XANES measurements [1, 2].In this work, we report observations from X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses on U in sediment thin-sections collected from the US Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Savannah River Site. An estimated 43,500 kg of U, along with large quantities of Ni and other heavy metals, was discharged to a riparianwetland system and accumulated in Steed Pond sediments, a farm pond pre-dating the SRS [3-5]. Long-term aging of U, Ni, and the other metals in organic-and Fe-rich sediments has resulted in significant redistribution into less labile forms [6]. Two-dimensional synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) mapping performed on these sediment thin-sections at National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beamline X26A suggests important and distinct roles for heterogeneous distributions (on 10\u2019s \u00b5m scale) of sediment organic matter and Fe-mixed oxide coatings in U and Ni sequestration.
