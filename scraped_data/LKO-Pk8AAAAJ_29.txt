Effects on growth, mortality, reproduction, and expression of a variety of genes associated with metal homeostasis, general stress, and oxidative stress were measured. We also used X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning X\u2010ray fluorescence microscopy to characterize changes in chemical speciation and spatial distribution of the NPs in soil media and earthworm tissues. Exposure concentrations of Cu NPs up to 65 mg kg\u22121 caused no adverse effects on ecologically relevant endpoints. Increases in metallothionein expression occurred at concentrations exceeding 20 mg kg\u22121 of Cu NPs and concentrations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 187, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12961741053727406096", "cites_id": ["12961741053727406096"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2009.0387", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EPgEatBa4bMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 14, "2012": 18, "2013": 17, "2014": 19, "2015": 18, "2016": 12, "2017": 17, "2018": 18, "2019": 8, "2020": 13, "2021": 14, "2022": 15}}
