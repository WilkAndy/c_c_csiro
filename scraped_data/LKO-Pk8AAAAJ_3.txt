Increasing evidence suggests that several classes of nanomaterials may accumulate in sludge derived from wastewater treatment and ultimately in soil following land application as biosolids. Little research has been conducted to evaluate the impact of nanoparticles on terrestrial ecosystems, despite the fact that land application of biosolids from wastewater treatment will be a major pathway for the introduction of manufactured nanomaterials to the environment. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, we used the model organisms Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi and Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) to investigate plant uptake and the potential for trophic transfer of 5, 10, and 15 nm diameter gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs). Samples were analyzed using both \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 408, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17213038386659525446", "cites_id": ["17213038386659525446"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es103031a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RgMBzjb_4O4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 25, "2013": 32, "2014": 40, "2015": 54, "2016": 44, "2017": 37, "2018": 36, "2019": 30, "2020": 26, "2021": 33, "2022": 27, "2023": 5}}
