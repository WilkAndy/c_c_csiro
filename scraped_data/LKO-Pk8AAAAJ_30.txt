The transport of Pu potentially released from spent nuclear fuel disposal and storage sites will be dependent on its interaction with mineral surfaces and speciation in the subsurface. The sorption of dissolved Pu(V) on a natural zeolitic tuff that was equilibrated with synthetic groundwater was examined using synchrotron-based microanalytical techniques. The tuff contained trace quantities of smectites and iron and manganese oxides, which are present as fracture fill and pore space materials. Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) showed that Pu is predominately associated with manganese oxides (rancieite) and smectites but not with iron oxides (hematite).
