Previous studies provide somewhat limited evidence for bioavailability of Au NPs in food webs, because the spatial distribution within tissues and the speciation of Au was not determined. In this study, we provide multiple lines of evidence, including orthogonal microspectroscopic techniques, as well as evidence from biological responses, that Au NPs are bioavailable from soil to a model detritivore (Eisenia fetida). We also present limited evidence that Au NPs may cause adverse effects on earthworm reproduction. This is perhaps the first study to demonstrate that Au NPs can be taken up by detritivores from soil and distributed among tissues. We found that primary particle size (20 or 55 nm) did not consistently influence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 183, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3641070704507911771", "cites_id": ["3641070704507911771"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es101885w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W35GuIOuhzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 6, "2012": 20, "2013": 16, "2014": 19, "2015": 19, "2016": 16, "2017": 18, "2018": 16, "2019": 11, "2020": 11, "2021": 17, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
