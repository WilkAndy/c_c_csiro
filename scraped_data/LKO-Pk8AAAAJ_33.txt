Much of our knowledge concerning contaminant-mineral  interactions at the molecular level, however, is derived from extensive  experimentation on model mineral systems. Although these investigations  have provided a foundation for understanding reactive surface  functional groups on individual mineral phases, the information cannot  be readily extrapolated to complex mineral assemblages in natural  systems. Recent studies have elucidated the role of less abundant  mineral and organic substrates as important surface chemical modifiers  and have demonstrated complex coupling of reactivity between  permanent-charge phyllosilicates and variable-charge Fe-oxohydroxide  phases.
