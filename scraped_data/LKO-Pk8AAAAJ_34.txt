Earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to Au NPs in artificial soil media and fed to juvenile bullfrogs (Rana catesbeina). Earthworm Au concentrations were continuously monitored so that the cumulative dose to bullfrogs could be accurately estimated throughout the experiment. We exposed a second group of bullfrogs to equivalent doses of Au NPs by oral gavage to compare the bioavailability of NPs through direct exposure to trophic exposure. We observed accumulation of Au in liver, kidney, spleen, muscle, stomach, and intestine in both treatment groups. Tissue concentrations decreased on average of approximately 100-fold with each trophic-step. The total assimilated dose averaged only 0.09% of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 168, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4753994403628847104", "cites_id": ["4753994403628847104"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3025325", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ABB-7LiU-UEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 19, "2015": 21, "2016": 21, "2017": 17, "2018": 14, "2019": 12, "2020": 14, "2021": 15, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
