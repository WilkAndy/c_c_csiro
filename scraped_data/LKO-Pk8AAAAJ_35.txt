Solutions ranging in Al concentration from 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 1.0 mol L\u22121 at OH/Al ratios (\u00f1) of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.25, and 2.50 prepared with base injection rates of 0.6 and 1.2 cm3 min\u22121 were investigated. For concentrated solutions (0.5 mol L\u22121), two polymeric species produced observable resonance peaks, the [AlO4Al12(OH)24(H2O)2]7+ polynuclear (i.e., \u201cAl13\u201d) species with a chemical shift (\u03b4) 63\u2010ppm downfield of the hexaaquaaluminum species, and the dimer Al2(OH)2(H2O)4+8, which displayed a broad resonance \u2245 3\u2010ppm downfield from the hexaaqua\u2010Al cation. In solutions of much lower Al concentration (3.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121), the Al13 polynuclear species was observed at \u00f1>0.25 and its concentration was found to increase linearly as a function of \u00f1.
