Silver exposure has long been known to cause toxic effects to a wide variety of organisms, making large scale production of silver nanoparticles a potential hazard to environmental systems. Here we describe the first evidence that an organism may be able to sense manufactured nanoparticles in a complex, environmentally relevant exposure and that the presence of nanoparticles alters the organism\u2019s behavior. We found that earthworms (Eisenia fetida) consistently avoid soils containing silver nanoparticles and AgNO3 at similar concentrations of Ag. However, avoidance of silver nanoparticles occurred over 48 h, while avoidance of AgNO3 was immediate. It was determined that avoidance of silver nanoparticles could not be explained by release of silver ions or any changes in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 159, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16422837337410439180", "cites_id": ["16422837337410439180"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10646-010-0590-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DAhf5Iuj6eMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 15, "2013": 13, "2014": 16, "2015": 19, "2016": 14, "2017": 23, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 10, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
