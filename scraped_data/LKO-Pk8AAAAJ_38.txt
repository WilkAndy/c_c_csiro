These microanalytical instruments are based on various forms of sample excitation and detection. They are complementary in terms of spatial resolution, element sensitivity, energy deposition and non-destructiveness.Several techniques fall in the class of methods employing charged particle excitation of X-ray fluorescence, including electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) and particleinduced X-ray emission (PIXE). EMPA is capable of \u00b5m-sized spots with minimum detection limits near 100 mg kg\u2212 1. PIXE is well suited for analyses of relatively light elements with 10 mg kg\u2212 1 sensitivity and \u00b5m \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12766574492011104961", "cites_id": ["12766574492011104961"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/rimg/article-abstract/49/1/429/140753", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wYriOtz7K7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 11, "2006": 13, "2007": 16, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 12, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 6}}
