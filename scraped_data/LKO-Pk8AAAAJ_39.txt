Currently, governments and transportation industries around the world are developing strategies to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with resuming activity. This study investigated the possible use of SARS-CoV-2 RNA wastewater surveillance from airline and cruise ship sanitation systems and its potential use as a COVID-19 public health management tool.Aircraft and cruise ship wastewater samples (n =\u200921) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using two virus concentration methods, adsorption\u2013extraction by electronegative membrane (n =\u200913) and ultrafiltration by Amicon (n =\u20098), and five assays using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12039039600895682444", "cites_id": ["12039039600895682444"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article-abstract/27/5/taaa116/5871228", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jGc_QLtCE6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 7, "2021": 57, "2022": 61, "2023": 28}}
