Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (A\u2013C) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (D\u2013E) centrifugal filter device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) precipitation, and (G) ultracentrifugation. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC", "num_citations": 374, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14911785485930965865", "cites_id": ["14911785485930965865"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972033480X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aau9t-RN8c4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 30, "2021": 157, "2022": 133, "2023": 54}}
