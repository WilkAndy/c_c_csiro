The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which each of these actinides was associated with groundwater colloids, a potential cause for the apparent enhanced transport. Contaminated groundwater was recovered along a 1.02 km transect at approximately the rate of groundwater flow, passed though an ultrafiltration system, and then chemically characterized. The filterable (> 500 molecular weight) fraction of nuclides increased with reported nuclide distribution coefficients (Kd values): Pu> Th> U> Am= Cm> Ra> tritium. The filterable fractions of the strongersorbing nuclides (Pu and Th) increased, whereas those of the weaker-sorbing nuclides (Am, Cm, and Ra) generally decreased with increasing pH (3.4 to 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14759766736027068071", "cites_id": ["14759766736027068071"], "pub_url": "https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1524/ract.1994.6667.s1.181/html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pyaFVKU51cwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 2, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 6, "2000": 6, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 10, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 12, "2008": 3, "2009": 12, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 11, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
