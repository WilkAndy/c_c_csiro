Models of colloidal transport conceptualize the vadose zone as a three-phase system where the contaminant partitions between the immobile solid matrix, the mobile aqueous phase, and the mobile colloids. Natural organic matter, present as dissolved macromolecules, or-ganic particulates, and coatings on inorganic colloids such as clay and iron oxide particles, comprises the most important material in soil solutions capable of facilitating the transport of NOC. The overall influence of these natural carriers on NOC transport is dependent on their concen-tration in soil solution, the degree of their interaction with the organic contaminant, their stability as suspensions, and their mobility \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 151, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6048701600322974402", "cites_id": ["6048701600322974402"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00039a021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wnKW3w5O8VMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 9, "1995": 6, "1996": 4, "1997": 15, "1998": 7, "1999": 8, "2000": 12, "2001": 9, "2002": 10, "2003": 7, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
