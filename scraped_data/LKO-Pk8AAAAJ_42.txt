We quantified organic C, a measure of organic matter, flowing from a blackwater stream draining a 12.6 km2 watershed on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain in South Carolina, and utilized a hydrologic approach to partition this outflow between its various pathways from upland and wetland forest sources. Results of this study indicate that 28.9 tonnes C yr\u22121 were exported in stream flow, which was estimated to be 0.5% of the annual C input from forest detritus to the watershed. Upland forest, which covers 94% of the watershed area, contributed only 2.0 tonnes C yr\u22121 to stream flow, which amounted to 0.04% of detritus annually produced by the upland forest. Organic matter was transported from uplands to the stream \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4505324167142141550", "cites_id": ["4505324167142141550"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00001304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bm59tHUghj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 5, "2000": 7, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 9, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
