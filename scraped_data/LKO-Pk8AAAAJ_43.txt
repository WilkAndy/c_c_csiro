Ag MNPs with citrate (CIT) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coatings were incubated with soil or municipal sewage sludge which was then amended to soil (1% or 3% sludge (w/w)). Pore waters were extracted after 1 week and 2 and 6 months and analyzed for chemical speciation, aggregation state and dissolution. Ag MNP coating had profound effects on aggregation state and partitioning to pore water in the absence of sewage sludge, but pre-incubation with sewage sludge negated these effects. This suggests that Ag MNP coating does not need to be taken into account to understand fate of AgMNPs applied to soil through biosolids amendment. Aging of soil also had profound effects that depended on Ag MNP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9214801590065518020", "cites_id": ["9214801590065518020"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749113003515", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xFWPWzmN4X8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 12, "2015": 20, "2016": 20, "2017": 29, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 7, "2021": 16, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
