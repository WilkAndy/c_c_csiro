Total As concentration in poultry litter can reach >40mg kg\u22121 and both roxarsone and its mineralization product As(V) have been identified in poultry litters (PL). To investigate the fate of these As species upon land application of PL we conducted two studies. In the first, an Orangeburg soil (Ultisol from the Atlantic Coastal Plain) was spiked with either 20mgkg\u22121 As(V) or roxarsone and incubated at 10% moisture content for 4 months. Exchangeable As was determined periodically by extraction with 0.1M PO4. Both As(V) and roxarsone displayed similar desorption; initially, approximately 70% of added As was ligand exchangeable and this decreased to 35% after 4 months incubation, presumably due to either slow sorption reactions or a change in solid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 143, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16529405134366943139", "cites_id": ["16529405134366943139"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653506008241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o6d1pmQ-ZOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 7, "2009": 11, "2010": 10, "2011": 10, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 20, "2015": 12, "2016": 11, "2017": 13, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
