We studied the dissolution, uptake, and toxicity of Ag-MNP and sulfidized Ag-MNPs (sAg-MNPs) to a model soil organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results show that reproduction was the most sensitive endpoint tested for both Ag-MNPs and sAg-MNPs. We also demonstrate that sulfidation not only decreases solubility of Ag-MNP, but also reduces the bioavailability of intact sAg-MNP. The relative contribution of released Ag+ compared to intact particles to toxicity was concentration dependent. At lower total Ag concentration, a greater proportion of the toxicity could be explained by dissolved Ag, whereas at higher total Ag concentration, the toxicity appeared to be dominated by particle specific effects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 135, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15394490554145969379", "cites_id": ["15394490554145969379"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749114004266", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4xT6cZg3pNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 7, "2016": 16, "2017": 19, "2018": 18, "2019": 19, "2020": 26, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
