Whereas many studies have investigated the wet chemistry of IP6, there is little information on the characterization of solid metal IP6 compounds. This information is essential for further understanding and assessing the chemical behavior of IP6 in diverse soil\u2013plant\u2013water ecosystems. As the first step in full characterization, we synthesized eight metal phytate compounds and investigated their structural features using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT\u2013IR). The absorption features from 900 to 1200 cm\u22121 in FT\u2013IR could be used to identify these phytates as: (i) light divalent metal (Ca and Mg) compounds with a sharp band and a broad band, (ii) heavy divalent metal (Cu and Mn) compounds with splitting broad bands, and (iii) trivalent metal (Al and Fe) compounds with a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13909472223339461105", "cites_id": ["13909472223339461105"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2006.0008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8blPpUpfCMEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
