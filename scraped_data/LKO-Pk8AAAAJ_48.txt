Fluro-, oxalato-, and cltratoalumlnum complexes were Identified by distinct peaks within chromatograms of Al solu-tions when the appropriate ligand was added. Excellent quantitative agreement between predicted species concen-trations (via the thermodynamic speciation model GEOCHEM) and those determined by ion chromatography was obtained for samples prepared In the eluent matrix. The predominantly outer sphere sulfatoalumlnum complexes were not observed to elute as singly charged species, but rather exhibited a retention time Indistinguishable from the AI (H20) e3+ species. It Is concluded that Inner sphere Al complexes (generally possessing relatively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6026102676879799821", "cites_id": ["6026102676879799821"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac00181a007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DXZz-3QEoVMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 4, "1990": 2, "1991": 7, "1992": 5, "1993": 4, "1994": 8, "1995": 6, "1996": 12, "1997": 5, "1998": 9, "1999": 7, "2000": 6, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
