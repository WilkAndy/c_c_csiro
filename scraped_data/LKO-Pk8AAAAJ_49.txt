Global genome expression for nematodes exposed to 4-nm citrate-coated Au-NPs at the LC10 level (5.9 mg\u00b7L\u20131) revealed significant differential expression of 797 genes. The levels of expression for five genes (apl-1, dyn-1, act-5, abu-11, and hsp-4) were confirmed independently with qRT-PCR. Seven common biological pathways associated with 38 of these genes were identified. Up-regulation of 26 pqn/abu genes from noncanonical unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and molecular chaperones (hsp-16.1, hsp-70, hsp-3, and hsp-4) were observed and are likely indicative of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Significant increase in sensitivity to Au-NPs in a mutant from noncanonical UPR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8128294712243904544", "cites_id": ["8128294712243904544"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es2033108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IOD7qPmAzXAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 13, "2016": 14, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 15, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
