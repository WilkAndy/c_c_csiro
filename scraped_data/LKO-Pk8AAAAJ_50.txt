Numerous detections of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been reported globally using various methods, demonstrating the technical feasibility of routine monitoring. However, to reliably interpret data produced from these efforts for informing public health interventions, additional quality control information and standardization in sampling design, sample processing, and data interpretation and reporting are needed. This review summarizes published studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater as well as available information regarding sample concentration, extraction, and detection methods.
