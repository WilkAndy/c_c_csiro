Surveillance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater can potentially provide an early warning signal of COVID-19 infections in a community. The capacity of the world's environmental microbiology and virology laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 RNA characterization in wastewater is increasing rapidly. However, there are no standardized protocols or harmonized quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance. This paper is a technical review of factors that can cause false-positive and false-negative errors in the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16750872396592326574", "cites_id": ["16750872396592326574"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721049524", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rifI3LENd-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 67, "2023": 41}}
