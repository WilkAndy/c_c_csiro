The monomeric Al concentrations (Ala) estimated by the ferron assay were consistently higher than the actual concentration determined by NMR spectroscopy. The differences between the methods indicate the presence of a small polymer which reacts rapidly with ferron and is erroneously assigned to the monomeric Al fraction. The polymeric Al component (Alb) estimated by the ferron method could be partitioned into a more rapidly reacting fraction (\u22641 h) and a slowly reacting fraction (>1 h). The amount of Al associated with the rapidly reacting polymeric fraction corresponded to the amount of [AlO4 Al12(OH)24(H2O)12]7+ polymer directly determined by NMR spectroscopy. The slower reacting component of the Alb \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10379241989204026569", "cites_id": ["10379241989204026569"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000060014x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ySRT_Jh5CpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 6, "1990": 10, "1991": 2, "1992": 7, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 6, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
