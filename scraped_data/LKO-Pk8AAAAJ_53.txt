However, it is also acknowledged that colloids <0.2 \u03bcm suspended in the aqueous phase can be important for determining contaminant availability and mobility. We have used flow field-flow fractionation (Fl FFF) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to UV-absorbance (UVA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to study the dissolved organic matter (DOM) and colloidal binding of U and Ni in water extracts of sediments collected from a contaminated area of the Savannah River Site, a U.S. Department of Energy former nuclear materials production and processing facility, near Aiken, SC. High-performance SEC\u2212UVA\u2212ICP-MS was well-suited to the separation of DOM over the molecular weight (MW) range of \u223c200\u22127000 Da.
