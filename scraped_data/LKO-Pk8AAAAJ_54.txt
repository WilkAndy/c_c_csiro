We hypothesized that metals with a higher stability constant for a metal-ferrihydrite surface complex would retard the transformation process to a greater extent. To test this hypothesis, we examined the influence of Ni or Pb sorption on the kinetics of ferrihydrite crystallization to goethite/hematite. Reported surface stability constants for Ni and Pb sorbed to ferrihydrite are logK1,int = 0.37 and 4.0, respectively (Dzombak and Morel, 1990). The structural evolution of nickel- and lead-ferrihydrite coprecipitates was studied for various metal loadings during aging at pH 6 or 11 and 70\u00b0C. Results of aging studies demonstrated that the influence on transformation kinetics was not related to the magnitude of the stability constant of the Ni- or Pb-ferrihydrite surface complex. At pH 11, crystallization was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8963373861196672716", "cites_id": ["8963373861196672716"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703799000101", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zC6maQlNZHwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 6, "2002": 7, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 8, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 7, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 12, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
