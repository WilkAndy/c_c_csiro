Within a small headwater catchment, concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a measure of DOM, were measured in soil solution at three depths (10, 30, and 90 cm) in sand A and E horizons of soil profiles, and in sand along the valley bottom at 198\u2010 to 264\u2010cm depth in shallow groundwater. Water samples were collected after every rainfall event for 21 mo using zero\u2010tension lysimeters, suction samplers, and piezometers. Mean concentration of DOC in soil water decreased from 25.5 mg C L\u20101 at 10\u2010cm depth to 13.7 mg C L\u20101 at 30 cm, and to 1.8 mg C L\u20101 at 76 to 99 cm, before \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3249074813198539315", "cites_id": ["3249074813198539315"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100030030x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MxpeCVQIFy0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 7, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 7, "2004": 8, "2005": 2, "2006": 8, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 11, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
