In this study, mobile colloids were collected after a rain from 13.5\u2010m3 lysimeters containing reconstructed pedons of two Ultisols. The mobile colloids were enriched with kaolinite, Fe oxides, and gibbsite and were more dilute in quartz and hydroxy\u2010interlayered vermiculite (HIV) relative to the total clay fractions of the originating pedons. The colloids were <1000 nm in diameter and had a bimodal size distribution: the larger colloids (\u2248760 nm) consisted primarily of quartz and HIV; the much more abundant smaller colloids (\u2248230 nm) consisted primarily of Fe oxides, kaolinite, and gibbsite. The colloids also had exceptionally high negative surface charges that probably originated from organic coatings (10 g kg\u22121). These organic coatings indicate that the majority of the colloids originated from the surface horizon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16474344059625708429", "cites_id": ["16474344059625708429"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100020038x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jZuOLaOgoOQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 5, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 11, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 9, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
