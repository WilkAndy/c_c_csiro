The past five years have seen a growing number of applications of synchrotron-based techniques to problems in the soil and environmental sciences. Synchtron-based techniques have applications in many other areas of agricultural research as well. The chapter highlights some of the major applications in soil, plant, and environmental research. Many of these applications represent the first use of synchrotron-based techniques in particular agricultural disciplines. The chapter describes the ways in which synchrotrons work, describe the properties of synchrotron radiation, and explain the terminology associated with synchrotron-based research. Synchrotrons vary in their capabilities, so a general \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17229625756224681818", "cites_id": ["17229625756224681818"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211308605374", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WnexvFbtG-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 10, "1999": 6, "2000": 2, "2001": 7, "2002": 9, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
