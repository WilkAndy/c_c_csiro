Plutonium sorbed to the tuff was preferentially associated with manganese oxides. For both Yucca Mountain tuff and synthetic pyrolusite, Pu(IV) or Pu(V) was initially oxidized to more mobile Pu(V/VI), but over time, the less mobile Pu(IV) became the predominant oxidation state of the sorbed Pu. The observed stability of Pu(IV) on oxidizing surfaces (e.g., pyrolusite), is proposed to be due to the formation of a stable hydrolyzed Pu(IV) surface species. These findings have important implications in estimating the risk associated with the geological burial of radiological waste in areas containing Mn-bearing minerals, such as at the Yucca Mountain or the Hanford Sites \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14490340151098917285", "cites_id": ["14490340151098917285"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es052353+", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pcHUJJgHGMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 8, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 7, "2011": 11, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 15, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
