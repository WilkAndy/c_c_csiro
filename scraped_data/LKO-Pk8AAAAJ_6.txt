To this end, a valence force field for aluminous, dioctahedral clay minerals was developed. Novel aspects of this development include the bending potential for octahedral O\u2212Al\u2212O angles, which uses a quartic polynomial to create a double-well potential with minima at both 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0. Also, atomic point charges were derived from comparisons of ab initio molecular electrostatic potentials with X-ray diffraction-based deformation electron densities. Isothermal\u2212isobaric molecular dynamics simulations of quartz, gibbsite, kaolinite, and pyrophyllite were used to refine the potential energy parameters. The resultant force field reproduced all the major structural parameters of these minerals to within 1% of their experimentally determined values.
