Treatments consisted of soils amended with biosolids generated with (1) Ag, ZnO, and TiO2 ENMs introduced into the influent wastewater (ENM biosolids), (2) AgNO3, Zn(SO4)2, and micron-sized TiO2 (dissolved/bulk metal biosolids) introduced into the influent wastewater stream, or (3) no metal added to influent wastewater (control). Soils were amended with biosolids to simulate 20 years of metal loading, which resulted in nominal metal concentrations of 1450, 100, and 2400 mg kg\u20131 of Zn, Ag, and Ti, respectively, in the dissolved/bulk and ENM treatments. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:9pM33mqn1YgC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1403698387933460402", "cites_id": ["1403698387933460402"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.5b01208", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:svePKD_wehMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 13, "2017": 14, "2018": 16, "2019": 17, "2020": 14, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
