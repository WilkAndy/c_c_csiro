On-route, the chemical properties of Ag may change, and further alterations are possible upon entry to soil. In the present study, we examined the long-term stability and (bio)availability of Ag along the \u201cwastewater\u2013sludge\u2013soil\u201d pathway. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that ca. 99% of Ag added to the sludge reactors as either Ag-NPs or AgNO3 was retained in sludge, with \u226579% of this being transformed to Ag2S, with the majority (\u226587%) remaining in this form even after introduction to soils at various pH values and Cl concentrations for up to 400 days. Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT), chemical extraction, and plant uptake experiments indicated that the potential (bio)availability of Ag in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5070563956582697257", "cites_id": ["5070563956582697257"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b01180", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KckCsw1DXkYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 19, "2018": 13, "2019": 15, "2020": 18, "2021": 16, "2022": 15, "2023": 2}}
