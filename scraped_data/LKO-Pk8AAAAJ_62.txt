Mobile colloids may act as a vector for the transport of adsorbed contaminants through soils and within aquifers (1) and can cause serious problems related to well monitoring and formation permeability in an injection well system (2, 3). Several studies have shown that colloids can increase the mobility of strongly sorbing contaminants such as radionuclides, transition metals, and hydrophobic organics [4-6), but approaches to predicting contaminant movement have often neglected the potential for colloid facilitated transport because little information is available on the occurrence or physicochemical characteristics of colloids in groundwater systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9120904108476230027", "cites_id": ["9120904108476230027"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00007a018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i2kgSPb1k34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 7, "1998": 9, "1999": 9, "2000": 7, "2001": 7, "2002": 5, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
