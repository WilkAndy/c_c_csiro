Amendment treatments ranging from 0 to 50 g kg\u22121 were added to the sediment and equilibrated in 0.001 M CaCl2 After equilibration, the treatment supernatants were analyzed for 137Cs+, U, PO4, and other metals. The residual sediments were then extracted overnight using one of the following: 1.0 M NH4Cl, 0.5 M CaCl2, or the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) extractant. Cesium was strongly sorbed to the contaminated sediments, presumably due to interlayer fixation within native illitic clays. In fact, 137Cs+ was below detection limits in the initial equilibration solutions, the CaCl2 extract, and the TCLP solution, regardless of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2549948753306940853", "cites_id": ["2549948753306940853"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2001.3041206x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tXVPhOE8YyMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 10, "2007": 6, "2008": 10, "2009": 8, "2010": 8, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
