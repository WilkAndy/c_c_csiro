A method of imbedding particles in a non-reactive Si polymer was developed  such that individual particles could be examined before and after extraction with a wide range of chemicals typically used  in sequential extraction techniques and others proposed for             ex situ             chemical intervention technologies. Using both the micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and micro-X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure  (XANES) techniques, both elemental and oxidation state distribution maps were generated on individual particles before and  following chemical extraction. XANES can determine the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4855220649959125239", "cites_id": ["4855220649959125239"], "pub_url": "https://akjournals.com/view/journals/10967/234/1-2/article-p237.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:93D0AnU1YUMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 8, "2004": 2, "2005": 8, "2006": 8, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
