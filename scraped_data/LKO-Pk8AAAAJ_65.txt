The objective of this study was to determine how soil pH (4.3\u20136.9), low total electrolyte concentration (TEC, 0.4\u20132.8 molc m\u20103), and low Na adsorption ratios (SAR, 0.3\u20131.8 [molc m\u20103]0.5) affected the concentration of mobile colloids released from 13.5\u2010m3 reconstructed Ultisol profiles. Critical flocculation concentration (CFC, the minimum TEC to induce flocculation of a clay suspension) tests were conducted using the water\u2010dispersible clay fraction of the Ap horizon of these profiles, which is the primary source for the mobile colloids. Surface soil pH, TEC, and SAR levels of the profiles that released high concentrations of colloids fell within the dispersion domain identified by the laboratory CFC tests. The effect of SAR on dispersion appears to be a continuum that approaches zero, and this \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1153590161159606624", "cites_id": ["1153590161159606624"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1996.03615995006000010041x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YNFNvCNgAhAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 5, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 6, "2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 9, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
