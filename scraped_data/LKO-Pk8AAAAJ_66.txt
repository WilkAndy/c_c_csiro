The objectives of this study were to localize Cr and determine the oxidation state and possible complexation mode of Cr in intact plant tissue by means of XANES, synchrotron XRF microprobe spectroscopy, and EPR spectroscopy. Subterranean clover (Trifolium brachycalycinum) was grown hydroponically with Cr(VI) (0.04\u22122.0 mmol L-1) and compared with plants grown without Cr and with inorganic Cr(III) and various Cr(III)\u2212organic sources. The uptake, translocation, and form of Cr in the plant were dependent on the form and concentration of supplied Cr. Chromium was found predominately in the +3 oxidation state, regardless of the Cr source supplied to the plant, though at high Cr(VI) treatment \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3650070477480425083", "cites_id": ["3650070477480425083"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es034156l", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:e3Zcp8KnpzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 11, "2006": 9, "2007": 2, "2008": 10, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
