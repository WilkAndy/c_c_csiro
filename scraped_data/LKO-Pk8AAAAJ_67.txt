Concentration-dependent uptake was measured in all treatments. Plants exposed to 100 mg kg\u22121 PVP-Ag ENMs and 100 mg kg\u22121 Ag+ exhibited reduced biomass and greatly reduced mycorrhizal colonization. Bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi were inhibited by all treatment classes, with the largest reductions measured in 100 mg kg\u22121 PVP-Ag ENMs and 100 mg kg\u22121 Ag+. Overall, Ag2S ENMs were less toxic to plants, less disruptive to plant-mycorrhizal symbiosis, and less inhibitory to the soil microbial community than PVP-Ag ENMs or Ag+. However, significant effects were observed at 1 mg kg\u22121 Ag2S ENMs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 93, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=222992957703257505", "cites_id": ["222992957703257505"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749115003358", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:of1Q3-k6GAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 10, "2017": 16, "2018": 8, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 18, "2022": 8, "2023": 7}}
