The relationship between the UV absorptivity at 272, 254, and 205 nm of six aquatic fulvic acids, eight soil fulvic acids, and four water soluble organic C (WSOC) fractions, and their aromatic C content, as determined by 13C cross\u2010polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy was evaluated. The percent aromatic C (determined by NMR) for the pooled soil and aquatic fulvic acids and WSOC fractions data was poorly correlated (r < 0.7) with the UV absorptivity measurements at all three wavelengths. When the soil fulvic acid was considered individually, however, a relatively high correlation (r = 0.80 to 0.85, P < 0.05) resulted for the prediction of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10746158992068559258", "cites_id": ["10746158992068559258"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100010022x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:msEd7qoGIpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 9, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
