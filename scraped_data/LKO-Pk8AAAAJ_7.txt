High concentrations are found in poultry litter (PL), which raises concerns regarding trace element loading of soils. Trace metal cation solubility from PL may be enhanced by complexation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Mineralization of organo\u2013As compounds may result in more toxic species such as As(III) and As(V). Speciation of these elements in PL leachates should assist in predicting their fate in soil. Elemental concentrations of 40 PL samples from the southeastern USA were determined. Water\u2010soluble extractions (WSE) were fractionated into hydrophobic, anionic, and cationic species with solid\u2010phase extraction columns. Arsenic speciation of seven As species, including the main As poultry feed additives, roxarsone (ROX; 3\u2010nitro\u20104\u2010hydroxyphenylarsonic acid) and p\u2010arsanilic acid (p\u2010ASA; 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 319, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16253393316661274807", "cites_id": ["16253393316661274807"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2003.5350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:t6hNehunj-EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 11, "2006": 14, "2007": 21, "2008": 23, "2009": 17, "2010": 22, "2011": 14, "2012": 26, "2013": 23, "2014": 27, "2015": 18, "2016": 21, "2017": 17, "2018": 14, "2019": 16, "2020": 6, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 2}}
