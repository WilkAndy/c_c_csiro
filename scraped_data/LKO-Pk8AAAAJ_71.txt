To address this knowledge gap, we examined the transformation of 30 nm ZnO MNMs in the presence of different concentrations of phosphate as a function of time and pH using a variety of orthogonal analytical techniques. The data reveal that ZnO MNMs react with phosphate at various concentrations and transform into two distinct morphological/structural phases: a micrometer scale crystalline zinc phosphate phase (hopeite-like) and a nanoscale phase that likely consists of a ZnO core with an amorphous Zn3(PO4)2 shell. The P species composition was also pH dependent, with 82% occurring as hopeite-like P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3889402215074241484", "cites_id": ["3889402215074241484"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es404544w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zBseKrXu-TUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 8, "2016": 10, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 14, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
