Growth, mortality, and ingestion rate were monitored. This experiment revealed (1) no evidence that caterpillars were affected by ingestion of ENM contaminated plant tissue; (2) low bioaccumulation factors (BAF = 0.16) compared to a previous study where hornworm caterpillars were fed plants that had previously bioaccumulated Au ENMs (BAF = 6.2\u201311.6); (3) inefficient elimination of accumulated Au ENMs not associated with hornworm gut contents; and (4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7729388376081947536", "cites_id": ["7729388376081947536"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es303333w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kNtlp8ZNRGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 9, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
