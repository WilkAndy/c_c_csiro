MNMs from these consumer products are being discharged into waste streams and subsequently entering terrestrial ecosystems, primarily via land application of biosolids. As a result, the concentrations of MNMs in terrestrial ecosystems are increasing exponentially. Despite this, the majority of research investigating the bioavailability, fate, and effects of MNMs has focused on aquatic ecosystems. We review the current state of the knowledge on the fate of MNMs in terrestrial ecosystems as well as their effects on critical terrestrial ecoreceptors, including plants, bacteria, fungi, and soil invertebrates. While research on the bioavailability, toxicity, and ultimate fate of MNMs in terrestrial ecosystems is in its infancy, we conclude that there are critical knowledge gaps and an incomplete picture is emerging \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4209341813507026581", "cites_id": ["4209341813507026581"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124202252000017", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:le5IzBOWajoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 17, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
