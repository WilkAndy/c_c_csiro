In repacked columns, the two sediments were leached (\u223c0.72 m d-1 Darcy velocity) with either 0.001 N NaCl or CaCl2 solutions for 10 pore volumes followed by 10 pore volumes of deionized water. Bulk clay mineralogy from the two samples and suspen sions generated in the column studies was characterized by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM results were confirmed by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and EDXA in a transmission electron microscope. In column experiments, the sample lower in Fe oxide displayed increased effluent turbidity that coincided with a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14323884712113097281", "cites_id": ["14323884712113097281"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es961075z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QUomJUGpyMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 9, "2004": 7, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
