To provide insight about the mechanism (s) responsible for the facilitated movement of several of these contaminant metals, ground\u2010water samples were recovered from the aquifer along a 1.02\u2010km transect at approximately the rate of ground\u2010water flow. Facilitated contaminant transport was attributed primarily to the poor cation\u2010sorbing capacity of the aquifer matrix and the soluble nature of the metals in the acidic plume. Based on chemical equilibrium calculations of ground\u2010water ultrafiltrates which agreed with results from cationic and anionic resin\u2010exchange experiments, over 90% of each contaminant metal (Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, and U) existed in cationic forms in the aquifer: either as soluble metals or as sorbates associated with positively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14751010333420123802", "cites_id": ["14751010333420123802"], "pub_url": "https://ngwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6584.1995.tb00016.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mnafeb4dtswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 8, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
