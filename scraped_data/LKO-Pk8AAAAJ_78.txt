In addition, U solid phase associations in suspended sediments were assessed by a sequential chemical extraction procedure to gauge U chemical lability. Mass flux estimates determined from base flow measurements potentially underestimate the amount of U transported from contaminated terrestrial sources to surface water systems. Erosional processes can effectively mobilize sediment\u2010associated contaminants during storms or flooding. During the various storm events measured, approximately 1500 to 2800% more U was exported to Upper Three Runs Creek (UTRC) relative to base flow measurements. Sequential extraction results suggest the suspended sediment load transports the bulk of U in labile forms \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10898029638501640654", "cites_id": ["10898029638501640654"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq1996.00472425002500050028x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zqmRSjeUPZcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 7, "2004": 2, "2005": 11, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
