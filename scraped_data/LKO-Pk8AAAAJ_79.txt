In sequential extractions of four sediments that ranged from 12.7 to 82.2 g kg\u22121 in organic carbon, U was found almost exclusively in moderately labile fractions (93% in acid\u2010soluble + organically bound). Nickel was distributed across all operationally defined fractions, including substantial amounts in the very labile fractions (4\u201315% in water\u2010soluble + exchangeable), noncrystalline and crystalline iron oxides (38\u201349%), and in the nonlabile residual fraction (25\u201334%). Aqueous U concentrations in 1:1 sediment\u2013water extracts were highly correlated to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (R2 = 0.96; p < 0.0001) and ranged from 29 to 410 \u03bcg L\u22121 Aqueous concentrations of Ni exceeded U by two to three orders of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15669514296471540804", "cites_id": ["15669514296471540804"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/jeq2003.8850", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RFQXZDtMddkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
