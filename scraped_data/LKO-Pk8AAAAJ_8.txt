Apatite additions lowered aqueous U to near proposed drinking water standards in batch equilibrations of two distinct sediment strata having total U concentrations of 1703 and 2100 mg kg-1, respectively. Apatite addition of 50 g kg-1 reduced the solubility of U to values less than would be expected if autunite (Ca(UO2)2(PO4)2\u00b710H2O) was the controlling solid phase. A comparison of the two sediment types suggests that aqueous phase U may be controlled by both the DOC content through complexation and the equilibrium pH for a given apatite application rate. Sequential chemical extractions demonstrated that apatite amendment transfers U from more chemically labile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 301, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4805946171776322555", "cites_id": ["4805946171776322555"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es980425+", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-0tgipQmskIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 10, "2001": 11, "2002": 13, "2003": 19, "2004": 15, "2005": 15, "2006": 25, "2007": 16, "2008": 19, "2009": 12, "2010": 11, "2011": 12, "2012": 9, "2013": 16, "2014": 14, "2015": 18, "2016": 11, "2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
