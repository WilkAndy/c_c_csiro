The ponds support euryhaline algae, which become incorporated in the sediments as depositional organic matter (OM) \u2013 facilitating reducing conditions. Our earlier studies have shown that U in one SJV sediment was primarily present as the highly soluble U(VI) species (as opposed to the less soluble U(IV) species), despite the presence of volatile sulfides. In this research, we investigated the effects of native pond algae (Chlorella) and potential reducing agents on U redox chemistry of SJV pond sediments. San Joaquin Valley pond sediments were equilibrated with natural and synthetic pond inlet waters containing approximately 10 mg U(VI) L-1 to which reducing agents (acetate, sucrose, and alfalfa shoot) were added \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15834205626031919150", "cites_id": ["15834205626031919150"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006185812588", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LtAfqB9mvtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
