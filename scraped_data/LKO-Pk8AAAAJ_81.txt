Nanomaterials are currently produced in metric tons per year, and this quantity is expected to increase rapidly over the next decade (2, 3, 7). At present, there are nearly 600 consumer products and other items that use nanotechnology according to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (httpzllwwwnanotechproj ect. org). There may be parallels between the nanotechnology revolution and past technological advances. For example, immediately following World War II, rapid progress in chemical synthesis led to the development of new, more efficacious pesticides and other persistent organic chemicals (8). These new materials were released to the environment under the assumption that the quantities involved would be diluted in the environment and pose little risk to humans. However, by the 1960s the caveat to this assumption became painfully clear. The new, more persistent organic chemicals were present in high concentrations in biota due to food chain accumulation and had caused widespread adverse effects on humans and wildlife (9-12). As was true for techno-logical advances in materials of the past, such as improvements in the synthesis of organic chemicals, the benefits of nanotechnology may have associated risks.
