The objective of this study was to investigate the response of six wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, having a demonstrated differential tolerance to Al under field conditions, to mononuclear and polynuclear Al when exposed in a solution culture bioassay system. The order of cultivar tolerance to mononuclear Al observed in this investigation was \u2018Yecora Rojo\u2019 > \u2018Titan\u2019> \u2018Caldwell\u2019> \u2018Wampum\u2019> \u2018Hart,\u2019 which is identical to that reported for these cultivars grown in acid soils. This observation demonstrates the utility of the hydroponic bioassay technique as a simple and effective means for screening genetically diverse plants for Al tolerance. Consistent with some previous reports, polynuclear Al was found to be much more toxic to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6914301652305537812", "cites_id": ["6914301652305537812"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700010022x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FGuRH7iI9F8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 7, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
