The SJV ponds are subjected to changes in redox chemistry with cycles of drying and flooding. Our past studies have shown that U in the SJV Pond 14 surface sediments is present as mostly the oxidized and soluble form, U(VI). However, we were uncertain whether the U in the soil was only present as a U oxide of mixed stoichiometry, such as U3O8(s) (pitchblende) or other species. Here we present characterization information, which includes wet chemical and in situ spectroscopic techniques (X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and low temperature time-resolved luminescence spectroscopies) for samples \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7241711294237429617", "cites_id": ["7241711294237429617"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001670379900410X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cc_0yg26f2QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 8, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 4}}
