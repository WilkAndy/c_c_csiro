This mobilization of Al is often episodic in nature, associated with pH depressions occurring during spring snowmelt or specific storm events (2-4). Coincident with these increases in [Al], Al speci-ation also varies, changing as a function of the ligand concentrations (ie, dissolved organic matter (DOM), F\", SO42\u2122, H4S1O4) and pH. Fluoro-Al complexes are particularly sensitive to pH changes, with the relative proportion of A1F2+ and AIF2\" 1\" increasing markedly in the pH range 4.5-5. S (5). Equilibrium calculations indicate that mixed ligand Al (OH) xFy complexes are important in slightly acidic waters (6). In addition, the concentration of organically bound Al has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12834950781060344207", "cites_id": ["12834950781060344207"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00043a012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j2m5nrvnHrIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3}}
