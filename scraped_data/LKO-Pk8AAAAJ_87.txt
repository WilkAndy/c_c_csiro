Isolation of four aerobic Ni-tolerant, Gram-positive heterotrophic bacteria indicated selection pressure from Ni. These isolates were identified as Arthrobacter oxydans NR-1, Streptomyces galbus NR-2, Streptomyces aureofaciens NR-3, and Kitasatospora cystarginea NR-4 based on partial 16S rDNA sequences. A functional gene microarray containing gene probes for functions associated with biogeochemical cycling, metal homeostasis, and organic contaminant degradation showed little overlap among the four isolates. Fifteen of the genes were detected in all four isolates with only two of these related to metal resistance, specifically to tellurium. Each of the four isolates also displayed resistance to at least one of six antibiotics tested, with resistance to kanamycin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7789928228416194991", "cites_id": ["7789928228416194991"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-006-9160-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rwmJcHNiG2wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 9, "2009": 10, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
