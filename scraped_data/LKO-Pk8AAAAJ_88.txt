Aluminum is, however, an element that is frequently analyzed in the study of geologic materials, sediments, sludges, and plant and/or animal tissues and in many industrial processes. For most of these analytical applications, the presence of interfering substances is ubiquitous, often resulting in the introduction of tedious, error-inducing pre-treatments that can complicate the analysis. In addition, the reagents commonly used to solubilize and/or extract Al in many of the aforementioned applications often cause matrix effects which make the analysis even more cumbersome. Many of the methods utilized for the quantitative deter-mination of soluble Al in different matrix solutions attempt to eliminate the various interferences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12472807355769675820", "cites_id": ["12472807355769675820"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac00125a052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LOCH0DRQGK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 6, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
