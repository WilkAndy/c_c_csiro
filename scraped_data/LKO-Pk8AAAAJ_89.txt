Over three days of sampling, the mean concentration of crAssphage gene copies (GC)/mL in 24-h composite samples did not differ significantly (p = 0.72-0.92), while for PMMoV GC/mL (p value range: 0.0002\u20130.0321) and HAdV GC/mL (p value range: 0.0028\u20130.0068) significant differences in concentrations were observed on one day of sampling compared to the other two. For all three viruses, the variation observed in 1-h composite samples was greater than the variation observed in 24-h composite samples. For crAssphage, in 54.1% of 1-h composite samples, the concentration was less than that observed in 24-h composite samples; whereas for PMMoV and HAdV \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15823175777294378068", "cites_id": ["15823175777294378068"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120314286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VGQy4Ig2l9sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 21, "2022": 28, "2023": 9}}
