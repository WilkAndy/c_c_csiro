The reversibility of metal partitioning to ferrihydrite can be significantly influenced by its transformation to more thermodynamically stable structures such as goethite or hematite. We studied changes in metal partitioning during aging of coprecipitates of ferrihydrite containing Cd(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), or Pb(II) at pH 6 and tem peratures of 40 or 70 \u00b0C and as a function of metal surface loading. Aqueous metal concentrations as well as the fraction extracted by 0.2 M ammonium oxalate were continuously monitored. At the end of aging, solids were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffraction. Prior to aging, the extent of metal sorption decreased in the order Pb(II) >> Ni(II) > Mn(II) \u2245 Cd(II). However, with ferrihydrite transformation, the extent of sorption increased and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 301, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15170784269533440559", "cites_id": ["15170784269533440559"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es960824+", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L-qfNepzidIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 5, "1999": 10, "2000": 6, "2001": 16, "2002": 12, "2003": 19, "2004": 9, "2005": 17, "2006": 16, "2007": 13, "2008": 19, "2009": 14, "2010": 9, "2011": 12, "2012": 15, "2013": 13, "2014": 14, "2015": 8, "2016": 14, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 10, "2020": 9, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
