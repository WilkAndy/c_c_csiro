We used synchrotron x\u2010ray microspectroscopy to analyze a range of samples that had been exposed to metal(loid) contamination. Microprobe x\u2010ray fluorescence elemental mapping (\u00b5SXRF) of decomposing rhizosphere microcosms consisting of Ni\u2010 and U\u2010contaminated soil planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum) showed the change in Ni and U distribution over a 27\u2010day period, with a progressive movement of U into decaying tissue. \u00b5SXRF maps showed the micrometer\u2010scale distribution of Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, and U in roots of willow (Salix nigra L.) growing on a former radiological settling pond, with U located outside of the epidermis and Ni inside the cortex.
