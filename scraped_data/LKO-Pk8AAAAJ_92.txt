The point of zero net charge (PZNC) values ranged from 4.1 to 8.4, increasing with the Al/Si molar ratio for the allophanes, and was highest for imogolite (Al/Si = 2.01). The PZNC values were significantly lower than the point of zero charge (PZC) values previously determined by microelectrophoresis for the same material, indicating that Na resided within the shear plane to a greater extent than Cl. The PZNC values of allophanes were lower than their PZSE values, indicating that permanent charge existed in allophanes, and increased as Al/Si decreased. Conversely, the PZNC of imogolite was higher than its point of zero salt effect (PZSE) determined by potentiometric titration.
