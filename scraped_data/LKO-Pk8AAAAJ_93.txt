We have employed synchrotron X-ray techniques to study Cu and Pb speciation and spatial distribution in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematodes were exposed to each metal ion singly or simultaneously in solution for 24 h and were then rinsed thoroughly and preserved in formalin for transportation to the National Synchrotron Light Source. Experiments were conducted at the microprobe beamline X26A employing a focused beam of approximately 10 \u03bcm in diameter. Nematodes were mounted in agar gel on Kapton tape. Two-dimensional elemental maps for Cu- and Pb-exposed nematodes were collected in fluorescence mode. Copper was homogeneously distributed throughout the body of the nematode, but Pb exhibited a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=624644650600387360", "cites_id": ["624644650600387360"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es050154k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IFPiDQAvqwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
