The magnitude and distribution of U, Ni, and other metals and the potential for trophic movement were studied to facilitate risk assessment and determine potential remedial action. Total and sequential extraction of TB soils demonstrated contaminant heterogeneity both spatially and between operationally defined fractions. Metal concentrations were elevated within riparian zone soils in contrast to stream sediments, suggesting off\u2010site transport. Leaf tissue from TB contained an order of magnitude more Ni than tissue from reference sites. Leaves from streamside trees contained no U but elevated Ni up to 75.4 (\u00b125) mg/kg dry weight (dry wt).
