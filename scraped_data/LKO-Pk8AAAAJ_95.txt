To investigate Pu sorption at a natural surface on a microscopic scale, we studied the bonding environment of sorbed Pu on zeolitic tuff with micro-XAS techniques. Using a focused 4 by 7 l. trn 2 beam, XAS spectra were taken at Mnsmectite regions where high levels of sorbed Pu were found. The Pu did not sorb to Fe-rich regions. XANES spectra show the presence of Pu (VI), based on edge energy. Preliminary analyses of the micro-EXAFS spectra indicate the absence of a first shell splitting of axial and equatorial Pu-O bonds--an environment unlike what is observed for most hexavalent actinides."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16538326691941109442", "cites_id": ["16538326691941109442"], "pub_url": "https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?s0909049598016811", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ws6CpIDwg-UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 8, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
