(Aiken, South Carolina) was used to determine the impact of ionic strength and solution composition on the determination of physical transport parameters using ionic tracers. The mineralogy of the clay fraction consisted primarily of kaolinite, goethite and mica. Repacked saturated columns (bulk density \u223c 1.5 g cm\u22123) were leached at a constant rate (\u223c 0.25 cm min\u22121) with a given tracer solution. For comparison, tritium (\u223c 200 pCi mL\u22121) was included in leachate of selected columns and several of the experiments were replicated in columns of acid-washed sand. Pore volume estimates based on tritium breakthrough were consistent with those calculated from the bulk density of the repacked matrix. In contrast, solute breakthrough for the sandy geologic material was dependent on concentration, as well as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2904954442694450236", "cites_id": ["2904954442694450236"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016977229500043U", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PNx-rax4UCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
