A difficulty with studying and modeling this contaminanttransport process has been in defining clearly whether the contaminants exist in the mobile-solid (colloidal) or mobile-aqueous phase. Tra-ditionally, researchers have assumed that contaminants were in the colloidal fraction when differences in con-taminant concentrations of ultrafiltrates were measured (2, 3). This technique is not entirely satisfactory because it provides only indirect evidence, is subject to a number of artifacts, and usually requires highanalytical precision at very low contaminant concentrations (1, 2, 4, 5). The Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) micro-probe at theNational Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, may provide a means for distinguishing between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16355894691325698323", "cites_id": ["16355894691325698323"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es00055a033", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E2EqhJDP--IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
