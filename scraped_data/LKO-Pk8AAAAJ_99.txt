Terrestrial environments are expected to be the largest repository for environmentally released ENMs. Because ENMs are enriched in biosolids during wastewater treatment, agriculturally applied biosolids facilitate ENM exposure of key soil micro-organisms, such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The ecological ramifications of increasing levels of ENM exposure of terrestrial micro-organisms are not clearly understood, but a growing body of research has investigated the toxicity of ENMs to various soil bacteria using a myriad of toxicity end-points and experimental procedures. This review explores what is known regarding ENM toxicity to important soil bacteria, with a focus on ENMs which are expected to accumulate in terrestrial ecosystems at the highest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "LKO-Pk8AAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9836230334488046945", "cites_id": ["9836230334488046945"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17435390.2018.1530391", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ye0U6F9PgYgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 12, "2021": 16, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
