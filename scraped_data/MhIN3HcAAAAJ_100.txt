Most of the components of the present observing array have been focused on the upper ocean, which is appropriate for climate studies on seasonal to interannual time-scales. Roughly half of the ocean is below 2000 m, however to date this large fraction of the ocean is seriously under-sampled. In the present observing system deep ocean observations are sparse in both space and time. This sparseness is not the result of a lack of effort or interest on the part of the community, but rather is due to both the technical challenges of deploying and maintaining instruments in the deep ocean and the high costs of ship time associated with collecting data and servicing instruments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6244147526379424749", "cites_id": ["6244147526379424749"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/41254712/Progressing_towards_global_sustained_dee20160115-19979-1xcg3y1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7cv6oherp1YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
