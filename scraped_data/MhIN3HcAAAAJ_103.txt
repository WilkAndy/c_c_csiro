The cross-stream coordinate is derived from current meter measurements of vertical shear of the horizontal velocity and is expressed in terms of specific volume anomaly at 780 dbar (             \u03b4 780             ). By averaging absolute and baroclinic velocity measurements in stream coordinates, the spatial smoothing that results from Eulerian averaging of measurements of a meandering current is avoided. The mean SAF velocity profile is composed of one central peak and several smaller peaks. In the central peak, the 2-yr mean absolute velocity from current meters reaches 52 cm s             \u22121             at 420 dbar; the mean baroclinic velocity from six CTD sections \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15621935128198112101", "cites_id": ["15621935128198112101"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/32/5/1520-0485_2002_032_1536_amsvot_2.0.co_2.xml?alreadyAuthRedirecting", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZeNxBDtDzNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
