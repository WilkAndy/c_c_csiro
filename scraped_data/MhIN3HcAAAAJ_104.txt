These data are assimilated within the framework of a steady state model that is based on hydrostatics, geostrophy, tracer, and potential vorticity conservation. Posterior variances of the major current systems are estimated via the implicit inversion of the Hessian matrix, associated with the assimilation scheme. Analysis of the residuals shows that averaged water mass properties are conserved and that most of the adjustment by the solution is through the uniform vertical displacement of density surfaces within the water column. The inclusion of the tracer and potential vorticity constraints allows parts of the large\u2010scale vertical and meridional circulation to be determined.
