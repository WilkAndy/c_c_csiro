We use direct velocity measurements, satellite altimetry, and an ocean state estimate to investigate the interaction of the ACC with the Macquarie Ridge. Satellite altimeter data show that the Subantarctic Front crosses the ridge through a gap immediately north of Macquarie Island. Yearlong current meter records reveal strong deep mean flow (>\u20090.2\u2009m\u2009s\u22121 at 3000\u2009m) and substantial transport (52 \u00b1 8 \u00d7 106\u2009m3\u2009s\u22121) in the 50\u2009km wide gap. The ACC becomes much more barotropic at the ridge. Acceleration of the deep jet is balanced by the ageostrophic along\u2010gap pressure gradient, convergence of zonal momentum by the mean vertical velocity, and dissipation. The study helps explain how the ACC negotiates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10849260678736471339", "cites_id": ["10849260678736471339"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014GL061880", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K2Wz_xpRkJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
