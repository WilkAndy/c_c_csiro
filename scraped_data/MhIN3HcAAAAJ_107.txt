A total of 140 quasi-synoptic CTD (Conductivity\u2013Temperature\u2013Depth) casts were analysed to map the spatial distribution of the summer hydrographic properties. Seven distinct hydrographic regimes were identified based on regional topographic features and the presence of specific water masses. These regimes are associated with spatial contrasts in the distribution of the High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) and the Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). In particular, the HSSW distribution confirms the unique character of Commonwealth Bay in terms of extreme bottom salinity and dissolved oxygen values. The bay appears to be a preferred region for both dense shelf water formation and storage.
