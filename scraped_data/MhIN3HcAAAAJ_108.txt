But, very recently, animal-borne instruments have also been designed and implemented that provide in situ hydrographic data from parts of the oceans where little or no other data are currently available (even from beneath the ice in polar regions). Ocean data is delivered from animal-borne instruments via satellites in near real-time, which would enrich the Global Ocean Observing System if animal-borne instruments were deployed systematically. In the last 10 years, studies involving more than 10 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Greenland, Norway, South Africa, UK, USA) have demonstrated how highly accurate oceanographic sensors, integrated into standard animal, biologging instruments, can provide data of equal or better quality than XBT/XCTD data. Here, we present some of the pioneering studies and demonstrate that we now have enough information for many marine species to predict where they will go\u2013within reasonable limits. Thus, we can direct sampling effort to particularly interesting and productive regions and maximize data return. In the future, biologging could certainly play an important part in the Global Ocean Observing System, by providing complementary data to more traditional sampling technologiesespecially in the high latitudes. This paper will make a core contribution to the Plenary Sessions 4A, 4B and 5A and will be relevant to 2A, 2B and 3A."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14751728489665250451", "cites_id": ["14751728489665250451"], "pub_url": "https://awi.eprints-hosting.org/id/eprint/21347/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k8SBQeequMwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
