The flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is largely zonal upstream of the Kerguelen Plateau. The southern branch of the Polar Front and the northern branch of the southern ACC front (SACCF) are deflected to the north by the topography and cross the plateau through the Fawn Trough. The southern branch of the SACCF and the southern boundary of the ACC pass to the south of Banzare Bank, through the Princess Elizabeth Trough. These fronts turn sharply to the north on the eastern flank of the plateau, then retroflect to the south before continuing eastward. Satellite altimetry and float trajectories suggest the ACC regime to the east of the plateau is eddy-rich and characterised by extensive meandering of the ACC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10514824986607854221", "cites_id": ["10514824986607854221"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064518300663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jaIpip0p7JEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 11, "2020": 10, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
