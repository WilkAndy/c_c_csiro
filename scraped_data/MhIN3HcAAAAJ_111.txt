Therefore, accurate parameterization of this process is needed to correctly represent the Southern Ocean ventilation in coarse-resolution models. We test a common approach to the parameterization of eddy fluxes (Gent and McWilliams, 1990) using output from the 1/6\u00b0 eddy-permitting Southern Ocean State Estimate, which assimilates a variety of ocean observations using an adjoint method. When a constant diffusion coefficient of conventional magnitude O(1000m2s\u22121) is used, the parameterized fluxes fail to reproduce the regional pattern and magnitude of eddy-driven subduction diagnosed from the model. However, when an appropriate choice is made for the diffusion coefficient, the parameterization does a good job of reproducing the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15756998135958824558", "cites_id": ["15756998135958824558"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500311000667", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bmZRDFIarNoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
