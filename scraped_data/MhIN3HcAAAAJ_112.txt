We confirm that the Polar Front (PF) is split into two branches over the Kerguelen Plateau, with the NPF crossing the north-eastern limits of our survey carrying 25Sv to the southeast. The SPF was associated with a strong eastward-flowing jet carrying 12Sv of baroclinic transport through the deepest part of Fawn Trough (relative to the bottom). As the section was terminated midway through the trough this estimate is very likely to be a lower bound for the total transport. We demonstrate that the SPF contributes to the Fawn Trough Current identified by previous studies. After exiting the Fawn Trough, the SPF crossed Chun \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9224922890767031931", "cites_id": ["9224922890767031931"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063710000439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e96JUH6CBYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
