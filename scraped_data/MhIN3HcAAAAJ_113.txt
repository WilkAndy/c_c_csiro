The distribution was also supported by in\u2010situ measurements. The eddy\u2010like structure was associated with changes in surface and subsurface water mass properties. Extremely high levels of chlorophyll in coastal areas were transported and redistributed horizontally offshore by these eddies, and a significant effect of the huge biomass on the biological processes in the investigated area was expected. The lateral exchange between coastal and offshore waters driven by these eddies, may be an essential factor in the observed patchy structures in this region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4337298970845498895", "cites_id": ["4337298970845498895"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003GL016996", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:D87pGW8uMTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2}}
