However, the nature, variability and continuity of the ACC fronts remain a topic of debate, in part because different methods provide different perspectives on this complex current system. The goal of this study is to identify a circumpolar coordinate system or reference frame that accounts for the multiple jets of the ACC and that would be suitable for future studies of cross-front fluxes. A new methodology is developed and tested using simulations from several ocean general circulation models (OGCMs). The method uses subsurface temperature criteria and transport maxima to identify five primary circumpolar fronts. The frontal structure derived using this approach is compared to the sea surface height (SSH) contour approach of Sokolov and Rintoul (2007) and a hybrid of the two methods is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4913861520953741613", "cites_id": ["4913861520953741613"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1463500311000837", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LZHovwSLMUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
