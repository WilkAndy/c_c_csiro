The subduction and export of SAMW from the Southern Ocean play an important role in global heat, freshwater, carbon, and nutrient budgets. However, the formation process and variability of SAMW remain poorly understood, largely because of a lack of observations. To determine the temporal variability of SAMW in the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean, we used a 15 year time series of repeat expendable bathythermograph sections from 1993 to 2007, seven repeat conductivity\u2010temperature\u2010depth sections from 1991 to 2001, and sea surface height maps. The mean temperature of the SAMW lies between 8.5\u00b0C and 9.5\u00b0C (mean of 8.8\u00b0C, standard deviation of 0.3\u00b0C), and there is no evidence of a trend over the 18 year record. However, the temperature, salinity, and pycnostad strength \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4436183531883925795", "cites_id": ["4436183531883925795"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008JC005146", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IxFhGGt9kD0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
