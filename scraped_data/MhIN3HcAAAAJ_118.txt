Comparison of the discontinuous XBT record with a continuous (weekly average) satellite\u2010based SST data set confirms that the XBT sampling is adequate to resolve interannual variability. Significant correlations are found between changes in surface and subsurface temperature along much of the section. In the Subantarctic zone, surface and subsurface changes are coherent because deep convection in winter homogenizes the upper 600 m, and the summer mixed layer temperature reflects the preconditioning of the previous winter. At other latitudes the regions of high correlation generally extend well beyond the depth of direct atmospheric influence (i.e., the depth of the winter mixed layer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14085259413152564598", "cites_id": ["14085259413152564598"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002JC001494", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:doUvMs_keMMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4}}
