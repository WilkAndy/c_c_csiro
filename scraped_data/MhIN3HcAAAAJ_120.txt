However, the physical mechanisms responsible for the transfer of Cant into the ocean interior remain poorly understood. Here, we use high resolution (1/10\u00b0) ocean simulations to investigate these mechanisms at the SAMW-AAIW subduction hotspots. Mesoscale Stationary Rossby Waves (SRWs), generated where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current interacts with topography, make the dominant contribution to the Cant transfer in SAMW-AAIW in the Indian and Pacific sectors (66% and 95% respectively). Eddy-resolving simulations reproduce the observed Cant sequestration in these layers, while lower spatial resolution models, that do not reproduce SRWs, underestimate the inventory of Cant in these layers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3333345395993592957", "cites_id": ["3333345395993592957"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-17292-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fcThEfprQi4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
