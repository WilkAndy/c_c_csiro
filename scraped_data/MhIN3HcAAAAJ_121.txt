Satellite ocean color images and altimetry clearly revealed a series of cyclonic eddies, with diameters of about 100\u2013150 km that were separated by about 150 km in the zonal direction. The eddies are found at almost the same locations and can be traced for at least two months in the spring\u2010summer period. Cold and fresh anomalies were found throughout the water column in the cores of the cyclonic eddies. The water properties in the core of the eddies are similar to water found over the continental slope, 150\u2013200 km to the south. The geopotential anomaly of the cold features was smaller than the sea level anomaly detected with satellite altimetry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10666280842052747513", "cites_id": ["10666280842052747513"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JC003712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-cAb2ek9BpQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
