Recent observations show that MCDW intrudes onto the continental shelf through a depression at the shelf break. Here we investigate such intrusions by combining (1) new oceanographic and bathymetric observations collected for two consecutive years by profiling floats in the depression south of the shelf break, (2) oceanographic measurements collected by conductivity\u2010temperature\u2010depth\u2010instrumented seals on continental slope, and (3) an ocean model. The depression provides a pathway for persistent inflow of warm (0\u20101\u00b0C) MCDW to the inner shelf. In austral autumn and early winter MCDW intrusions were up to 0.5\u00b0C warmer and were ~75 m thicker than in spring and summer.
