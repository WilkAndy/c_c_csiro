The largest net community production (NCP, based on O2/Ar), and air\u2013sea CO2 disequilibrium (\u0394DpCO2) were found in three regions: (1) between the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (63.6\u00b0S) and southern extent of the Polar Front (58.6\u00b0S, NCP = 30 mmol C m\u2212 2 d\u2212 1, \u0394pCO2 = 30 to 50 \u03bcatm); (2) between the northern extent of the Sub-Antarctic Front (45.5\u00b0S) and the Sub-Tropical Front (39.8\u00b0S, NCP = 50 mmol C m\u2212 2 d\u2212 1, \u0394pCO2 = 25 \u03bcatm); and (3) near 35\u00b0S (NCP = 50 mmol C m\u2212 2 d\u2212 1, \u0394pCO2 = 20 \u03bcatm).
