Northern Hemisphere summer refers to July\u2013September whereas Southern Hemisphere summer refers to January\u2013March. A recent worldwide synthesis of lake temperatures (O\u2019Reilly et al. 2015) found that LSSWTs rose by, on average, 0.034 C yr-1 between 1985 and 2009,~ 1.4 times that of the global surface air temperature (SAT) in general. Data from lakes in various regions collated here show that during 2009\u201315 lake temperatures continued to rise.During 2015, LSSWT of many lakes exceeded their 1991\u20132010 averages by 1 C or more (Online Fig. S2. 6; Plate 2.1 c). Strong warm anomalies in LSSWT were most prominent in central Europe [Austria, Switzerland, and Poland (data from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, Poland)], where anomalies above 1 C were recorded. The hot central European summer (JJA) of 2015 (sections 2b6 7f, and Sidebar 7.1) is reflected in relatively high mean LSSWTs in three Austrian lakes (Mondsee, Neusiedler See, W\u00f6rthersee; Fig. 2.6; Online Fig. 2.6) with anomalies up to+ 1.6 C. Similarly, satellite-based LSSWT anomalies of 25 European lakes in and near the Alps were in excess of 1.0 C in 2015 (Fig. 2.7 a), the second warmest anomaly year since the record summer of 2003 (Beniston 2004). High LSSWTs were also observed in other regions of the world (Plate 2.1 c; Online Fig. 2.6), with anomalies for lakes in Seattle [Washington (state), US], for example, up to+ 1 C in 2015."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12295427134053041559,5523076035579309017,291268780055461813", "cites_id": ["12295427134053041559", "5523076035579309017", "291268780055461813"], "pub_url": "https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/66480/1/Lake_surface_temperatures.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:l0XuntUhoqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 3}}
