This meridional heat flux is accomplished by both the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and by basin-wide horizontal gyre circulations. In the North Atlantic subtropical latitudes the AMOC dominates the meridional heat flux, while in subpolar latitudes and in the subtropical South Atlantic the gyre circulations are also important. Climate models suggest the AMOC will slow over the coming decades as the earth warms, causing widespread cooling in the Northern hemisphere and additional sea-level rise. Monitoring systems for selected components of the AMOC have been in place in some areas for decades, nevertheless the present observational network provides only a partial view of the AMOC, and does not unambiguously resolve the full variability of the circulation. Additional observations, building on existing measurements, are required to more completely quantify the Atlantic meridional heat transport. A basin-wide monitoring array along 26.5 N has been continuously measuring the strength and vertical structure of the AMOC and meridional heat transport since March 31, 2004. The array has demonstrated its ability to observe the AMOC variability at that latitude and also a variety of surprising variability that will require substantially longer time series to understand fully. Here we propose monitoring the Atlantic meridional heat transport throughout the Atlantic at selected critical latitudes that"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5328187701576902133", "cites_id": ["5328187701576902133"], "pub_url": "https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_993839/component/file_993838/content", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9aUYEXyG8UkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
