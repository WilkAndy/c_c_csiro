Changes in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrients were used to disentangle the effect of solubility, biology, circulation and anthropogenic carbon (CANT) uptake on the variability of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for eight water mass layers defined by neutral surfaces (\u03b3n). CANT was estimated using an improved back-calculation method. Warming (\u223c\u20090.0352\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0170\u202f\u00b0C\u202fyr\u22121) of Subtropical Central Water (STCW) and Antarctic Surface Water (AASW) layers decreased their gas solubility, and accordingly DIC concentrations increased less rapidly than expected from equilibration with rising atmospheric CO2 (\u223c\u202f0.86\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fyr\u22121 versus \u223c\u20091\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fyr\u22121). An increase in apparent oxygen utilisation (AOU) occurred in these layers due to either remineralisation of organic matter or intensification of upwelling. The range of estimates for the increases in CANT were 0.71\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08 to 0.93\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fyr\u22121 for STCW and 0.35\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14 to 0.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f 0.21\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fyr\u22121 for AASW, with the lower values in each water mass obtained by assigning all the AOU change to remineralisation. DIC increases in the Sub-Antarctic Mode Water (SAMW, 1.10\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fyr\u22121) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW, 0.40\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.15\u202f\u00b5mol\u202fkg\u22121\u202fyr\u22121) layers were similar to the calculated CANT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4169539241246496255", "cites_id": ["4169539241246496255"], "pub_url": "https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/14/5217/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_5WMR9kt3TkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
