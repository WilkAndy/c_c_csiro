Measurements every 10 min for \u03b418O and \u03b4D, 15 min for DIC yielded 2499 and 2289 discrete measurements respectively. High resolution data enabled the delineation of water mass boundaries as well as revealing insights into surface hydrological and biological processes. \u03b418O, \u03b4D, and \u03b413CDIC decreased southwards, dropping by approximately 1.0\u2030, 7.0\u2030, and 0.5\u2030, respectively. Though the decline in \u03b413CDIC with latitude was generally linear, the drop in \u03b418O and \u03b4D was punctuated by areas of rapid, significant change corresponding to the Sub-Tropical, Sub-Antarctic and Polar Fronts.
