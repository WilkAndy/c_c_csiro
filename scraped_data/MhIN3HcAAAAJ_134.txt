Nearly 500 specimens were sampled during the Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census expedition onboard the RV \u2018Aurora Australis\u2019(December 2007 to January 2008), from 50 of the 87 stations over a 400 km\u00b2 area. Abiotic environmental factors were measured and an ocean circulation model was used to generate near-bottom parameters. The ecological niche of A. adriani was described by using ecological-niche factor analysis and Mahalanobis distances factor analysis. An environmental suitability map (ESM) was developed to map the optimal habitat. A. adriani prefers moderately deep and relatively cold waters with moderate current velocity, and a substrate with low gravel content and biogenic carbonate. The ESM shows 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14431508558387277786", "cites_id": ["14431508558387277786"], "pub_url": "https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v441/p105-116/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2u-ui5IER8gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
