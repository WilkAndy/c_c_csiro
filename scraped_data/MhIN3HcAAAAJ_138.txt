Summer hydrographic observations, including stable oxygen isotope ratio (\u03b418O), in 2001/2008 and 2011/2015 and results of a numerical model are used. Along the western flank of the MGT, temperature decreased between 2001 and 2015 for most of the water column in the Ad\u00e9lie Depression. \u03b418O generally decreased, especially at the MGT draft depths on the northern side. West of the MGT, temperature, salinity, and \u03b418O decreased in the intermediate layer. East of the MGT, in contrast, temperature increased between 2001 and 2011 at intermediate depths, salinity increased in the intermediate and deep layers, and \u03b418O slightly decreased in the deep layer but did not change much \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3956199682528864983", "cites_id": ["3956199682528864983"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017JC012925", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:12qlgaY-5zYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
