The physical processes driving the shelf circulation and its seasonal and interannual variability remain poorly understood. We use a unique time series of repeat hydrographic observations from the Ad\u00e9lie Land continental shelf and a box inverse model to explore the relationship between surface forcing, shelf circulation, cross\u2010shelf exchange, and dense water formation. A wind\u2010driven northwestward coastal current, set up by onshore Ekman transport, dominates the summer circulation. During winter, strong buoyancy loss creates dense shelf water. This dense water flows off the shelf, with a compensating on\u2010shelf flow that is an order of magnitude larger in winter than in summer. The results demonstrate the importance of winter buoyancy loss in driving the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14430927693121044238", "cites_id": ["14430927693121044238"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016GL069479", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Dr_TT0f0RMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
