Antarctic Bottom Water has warmed, freshened, and contracted in recent decades, but the causes remain poorly understood. We use unique multiyear observations from the continental shelf and deep ocean near the Mertz Polynya to examine the sensitivity of this bottom water formation region to changes on the continental shelf, including the calving of a large iceberg. Postcalving, the seasonal cycle of Dense Shelf Water (DSW) density almost halved in amplitude and the volume of DSW available for export reduced. In the deep ocean, the density and volume of Ad\u00e9lie Land Bottom Water decreased sharply after calving, while oxygen concentrations remained high, indicating continued ventilation by DSW. This natural experiment illustrates how local changes in forcing over the Antarctic continental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1296469846436977442", "cites_id": ["1296469846436977442"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL076195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ipvh0nT8_REJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
