The ice tongue extended to the north more than 800 km from the surrounding ice edge and covered an area greater than 200,000 km2. Satellite measurements of ice extent and roughness characteristics demonstrate that the tongue persisted as a distinct feature throughout the winter. Remote sensing observations between 1978 and 2004 confirm that ice tongues occur frequently at this location, although the 2002 tongue was particularly pronounced. We show that ocean currents and winds conspire to favor the development of ice tongues at this location. Mean streamlines of the southern part of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current turn sharply to the north near 85\u00b0E after passing through the Princess Elisabeth Trough. The edge and northern limit of the ice tongue correspond well with the pattern of mean streamlines \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2890331090515857300", "cites_id": ["2890331090515857300"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007JC004541", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lA93LdCEHCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
