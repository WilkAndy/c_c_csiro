Here we present post-calving observations that suggest that this reconfiguration and subsequent grounding of B09B have driven the development of a new polynya and associated HSSW production off Commonwealth Bay. Supported by satellite observations and modelling, our findings demonstrate how local icescape changes may impact the formation of HSSW, with potential implications for large-scale ocean circulation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5834613134395447824", "cites_id": ["5834613134395447824"], "pub_url": "https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2016-19/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:EBp4jbu1-FAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
