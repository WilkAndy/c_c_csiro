The high spatial and temporal resolution allows the location, structure and variability of the fronts to be investigated in detail. A large number of criteria are examined in an effort to identify reliable indicators of the fronts (e.g. lateral gradients along isobars and isopycnals, transport maxima, and the latitude where a property isoline crosses a particular isobar). The location of the Subtropical Front (STF) varies by less than 1\u00b0 from its mean latitude of 45.2\u00b0S between the Tasmanian continental slope and the South Tasman Rise. The high resolution sections resolve multiple branches or filaments of each of the main fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) south of Australia: the Subantarctic Front (SAF) has two cores at mean latitudes of 50 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 321, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12582207197412288435", "cites_id": ["12582207197412288435"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924796302002002", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s2cfXMj6nK4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 10, "2005": 12, "2006": 18, "2007": 17, "2008": 23, "2009": 8, "2010": 13, "2011": 30, "2012": 17, "2013": 25, "2014": 15, "2015": 12, "2016": 16, "2017": 24, "2018": 14, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 20, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
