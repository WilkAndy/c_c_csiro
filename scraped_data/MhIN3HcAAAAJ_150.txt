Cross validation shows this relationship can be used to infer baroclinic transport (above and relative to 2500 m) from expendable bathythermograph (XBT) temperature measurements with an error of a few per cent. Transport errors of less than 2 Sv are obtained if temperature at depths between 600 and 1600 m is used to define the relationship. Temperature at depths above 300 m provides an unreliable index of transport because of variability in temperature\u2010salinity (T\u2010S) properties produced by air\u2010sea interaction. The scatter in the relationship between temperature and stream function from repeat observations along a single line is similar in magnitude to the scatter observed when data from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10407794481914296770", "cites_id": ["10407794481914296770"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003JC002010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wrnFPfDpb5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
