Koblinsky and N \u2026, 2001", "author": "SR Rintoul and J Church and Eberhard Fahrbach and M Garcia and A Gordon and B King and R Morrow and AH Orsi and K Speer", "abstract": "The Southern Ocean influences regional and global climate in profound ways, and several unique features of the Southern Ocean contribute to this influence: the zonally unbounded nature of the circumpolar ocean, the fact that deep and intermediate layers in the ocean interior are exposed to direct atmospheric forcing there, and the presence of a vast extent of seasonally varying sea ice. The Southern Ocean environment is also remote and hostile. As a consequence, historical data are scarce and hypotheses regarding the climate impact of Southern Ocean processes have been difficult to formulate and test. Design and implementation of an observing system for the Southern Ocean is therefore a formidable challenge. By building on recent scientific and technological advances, however, we can now define and obtain the sustained observations needed to understand the role of the Southern Ocean in climate change and variability.A program of coordinated Southern Ocean climate studies is proposed. These experiments will focus on the shallow and deep overturning cells, interbasin exchange, and low-frequency variability of the coupled system. Sustained observations are essential to describe the variability of each of these phenomena, as well as to understand the physical mechanisms driving the variability and to assess sensitivity to future change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3482867020352252592", "cites_id": ["3482867020352252592"], "pub_url": "https://awi.eprints-hosting.org/id/eprint/4225/1/Rin2001a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sOoEHBqhVTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
