These anomalies were consistent with the positive SAM index registered in all months except October. February had a record high SAM index value of+ 4.92 (13% higher than the previous high value recorded over 1981\u20132010).\u2022 There was an abrupt but short-lived switch in the mean surface temperature anomaly for the continent (from cold to warm) and a weakening of the negative surface pressure anomaly in October 2015. These atmospheric circulation changes coincided with the emerging high-latitude response to El Ni\u00f1o, the ozone hole, and a shift in the SAM index from positive to negative.\u2022 The 2015 Antarctic ozone hole was amongst the largest in areal coverage and most persistent, based on the record of ground and satellite observations starting in the 1970s. This very large ozone hole was caused by unusually weak stratospheric wave dynamics, resulting in a colder-and stronger-than-normal stratospheric polar vortex. The persistently below-normal temperatures enabled larger ozone depletion by human-produced chlorine and bromine compounds, which are still at fairly high levels despite their continuing decline resulting from the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10532208272306703146,11682243710364011909", "cites_id": ["10532208272306703146", "11682243710364011909"], "pub_url": "https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/514622/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KotFI5_rKZIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 8}}
