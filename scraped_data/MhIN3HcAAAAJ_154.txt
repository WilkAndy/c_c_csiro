Cross-validation shows this relationship can be used to infer baroclinic transport (above and relative to 2500 dbar) from XBT temperature measurements with an error of a few per cent. The mean transport distribution derived from 31 austral summer XBT sections over a six year period consists of westward ow immediately south of Tasmania, a broad band of strong eastward ow between 50 S and 55 S, and three cores of eastward ow south of 55 S. The mean net transport in each austral summer varies smoothly over the six year record, with a minimum in 1993-1994 and a maximum in 1996-1997.
