Section of temperature along the WOCE SR3 line in March, 1993, truncated in latitude and depth to emphasise the SAF (isotherms in C). The locations of the horizontal electrometers (the middle row of instruments in Fig. 1) are shown to indicate the positioning of the SAFDE array relative to the SAF.SAFDE has achieved multi-year observations of currents and temperatures in both a small current meter mooring array with a diameter of~ 70 km, and along a SSW-NNE section perpendicular to the expected mean axis of the ACC at the Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF). The experiment lasted two years, from April 1995, through March 1997. The measured variables are coherent horizontally and vertically in broad, sub-inertial frequency bands. The rarity of such horizontally coherent observations, required for estimating momentum budgets, etc., is revealed by noting that when SAFDE was proposed six years ago only three locations in the ACC had been sampled with moored current meters for as long as one year, and only one location for as long as two years, with the horizontally coherent records all being no more than about a year long."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2978120997138474757", "cites_id": ["2978120997138474757"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11035256.pdf#page=31", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BSeSpERpVCkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
