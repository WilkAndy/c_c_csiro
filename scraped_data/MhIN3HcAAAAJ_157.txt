The cross\u2010slope density field, calculated from profiles collected by conductivity\u2010temperature\u2010depth\u2010tagged marine mammals on the East Antarctic slope (0\u2013160\u00b0E, above 1,000\u2010 to 3,000\u2010m isobaths), indicates eddy\u2010driven overturning: onshore transport of CDW and offshore transport of shallower Antarctic Surface Water. Enhanced eddy activity, determined by a spice standard deviation threshold in the CDW layer, is present over about a third of the East Antarctic slope analyzed. Significantly stronger CDW transport in regions of elevated spice variability produces subsurface temperature anomalies of 0.2\u20130.25 \u00b0C relative to the East Antarctic average. Estimating eddy diffusivity from the hydrography yields about 0.8 m2/s of warm CDW transport to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9374509438524148939", "cites_id": ["9374509438524148939"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL082999", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y0zHgqryGIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
