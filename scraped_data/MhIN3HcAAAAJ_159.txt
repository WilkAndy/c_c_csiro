The cruise commenced with the K-AXIS project, the major marine science component of the cruise. This was the Australian component (PI\u2019s Andrew Constable, Steve Rintoul and others) of a combined biological and oceanographic study in the vicinity of the Kerguelen Axis. After conclusion of marine science work the ship went to Mawson for a resupply. During a storm on 24th February the ship broke free of its mooring lines and ran aground on the rocks at West Arm in Horseshoe Harbour, thus ending the cruise. Expeditioners were eventually taken to Casey on the Shirase, then flown home. Meanwhile the Aurora Australis was refloated and sailed to Fremantle, then on to Singapore for repairs.This report discusses the oceanographic data from CTD operations on the cruise. A total of 47 CTD vertical profile stations were taken on the cruise (Table 1). Over 850 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+ nitrite and silicate), dissolved inorganic carbon (ie TCO2), alkalinity, POC and PN, and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. A UVP particle counter/camera system was attached to the CTD package (PI Emmanuel Laurenceau). A separate trace metal rosette system was deployed from the trawl deck (PI Andrew Bowie). Upper water column current profile data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP, and meteorological and water property data were collected by the array of ship's underway sensors \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12563555842603871794", "cites_id": ["12563555842603871794"], "pub_url": "https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/12452/a1603.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mu4vanm3Wq4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3}}
