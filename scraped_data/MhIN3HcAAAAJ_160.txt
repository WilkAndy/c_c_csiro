We summarize here the main results that have been published in both science components since 2003/2004. Instrumented southern elephant seals visit different regions within the Southern Ocean (frontal zones, continental shelf, and/or ice covered areas) and forage in a variety of different water masses (eg Circumpolar Deep Water upwelling regions, High Salinity Shelf Water), depending on their geographic distribution. Adult females and juvenile males from Kerguelen Is. forage pelagically in frontal zones of the Southern Indian Ocean, while adult males forage benthically over the Kerguelen Plateau and the Antarctic Continental Shelf, with the two groups feeding at different trophic levels as shown by stable isotopes analysis. Oceanographic studies using the data collected from the seals have, to date, concentrated on circumpolar and regional studies of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) circulation. The temperature and salinity profiles documented by elephant seals at high latitudes, including below sea ice, have permitted quasi-circumpolar mapping of the southernmost fronts of the ACC. By merging conventional data and the high temporal and spatial resolution data collected by seal-borne SRDLs, it has been possible to describe precisely \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2552958655929783825", "cites_id": ["2552958655929783825"], "pub_url": "https://awi.eprints-hosting.org/id/eprint/21346/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ERb0FF_ubSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
