We analysed 47 still-image and video transects sampled during the Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census (CEAMARC) expedition in 2007\u20132008. We recorded the inferred current direction from 1537 comatulid observations and interpolated these data across the shelf using the Natural Neighbour Interpolation (NNI) method. Results revealed a mode current directionality at each station and a close local agreement between the observed and interpolated NBC directions. The interpolated NBC directions show a coherent counter-clockwise gyre in the deep George V Basin, with a northward and westward flow over the northern flank of the basin and eastward flow near the coast, consistent with the distribution of bottom salinity.
