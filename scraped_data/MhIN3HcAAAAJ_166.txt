The strong eastward flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the ocean basins, allowing the existence of a global-scale overturning circulation that carries most of the ocean heat transport. The tilting of density surfaces associated with the geostrophic flow of the ACC brings dense water to the surface at high latitudes. Water mass transformations where these layers outcrop link the upper and lower limbs of the overturning circulation. Water masses exported from the Southern Ocean ventilate the deep and intermediate layers of the ocean and play an important part in global budgets of heat, freshwater, carbon and nutrients. Recent progress in understanding the circulation of the Southern Ocean and its role in climate variability and change is reviewed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14982949150383581355", "cites_id": ["14982949150383581355"], "pub_url": "http://bibdigital.sid.inpe.br/rep-/cptec.inpe.br/adm_conf/2005/10.30.23.10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:q6hahN4g7s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
