The observed and simulated surface temperature shows a similar pattern between the Atlantic and Pacific: warming to the north of the Subantarctic/Subtropical Fronts in the Atlantic and of the Subtropical Front in the Pacific and cooling to the south of those fronts. The subsurface temperature trend, again from both observation and model, reveals an asymmetric pattern between the Atlantic and Pacific: subsurface warming is dominant over the whole ACC region in the Atlantic, while both warming and cooling are significant in the Pacific, the former located to the north of the Subantarctic Front and the latter to the south. The model reveals that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5249844428980352269", "cites_id": ["5249844428980352269"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-56053-1_9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DfVve7Ex20gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
