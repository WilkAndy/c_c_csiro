Yet, it remains one of the most difficult water masses to observe. An array of 12 Deep Argo floats, capable of profiling from the surface to the seafloor and under sea ice, provides a new perspective on AABW in the Australian\u2010Antarctic Basin. Over 2 years of data from the floats illuminate AABW properties with unprecedented detail, simultaneously sampling AABW at multiple locations, year\u2010round, throughout the basin. Calibrating each float individually with nearby, quasi\u2010simultaneous shipboard profiles ensures the highest quality salinity data, with estimated accuracy of \u00b10.005 or better.
