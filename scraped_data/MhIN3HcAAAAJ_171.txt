Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) originates in the sSO and supplies the lower limb of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), occupying 36% of ocean volume. Climate models struggle to represent continental shelf processes that form AABW. We explore sources of persistent model biases by examining response of the sSO to perturbations in surface forcing in a global ocean\u2013sea ice model (ACCESS-OM2) that forms AABW both on shelf and in open ocean. The sSO response to individual and combined perturbations of surface heat, freshwater, and momentum fluxes follows the WCRP CMIP6 FAFMIP-protocol. Wind perturbation (i.e., a poleward shift and intensification of the westerlies) is dominant, enhancing AABW formation and accelerating the global MOC. This occurs through upwelling of warm waters and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:FiDNX6EVdGUC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18247102466475306053", "cites_id": ["18247102466475306053"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/34/21/JCLI-D-21-0161.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RSxqFgS7Ov0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
