While the Weddell and Ross Seas are recognized as key sites for AABW production, additional sources have been discovered in coastal polynya regions around East Antarctica, most recently at Vincennes Bay. Vincennes Bay, despite encompassing two distinct polynya regions, is considered the weakest source, producing Dense Shelf Water (DSW) only just dense enough to contribute to the lighter density classes of AABW found offshore. Here we provide the first detailed oceanographic observations of the continental shelf in Vincennes Bay (104\u2010111\u00b0E), using CTD data from instrumented elephant seals spanning from February to November of 2012. We find that Vincennes Bay has East Antarctica\u2019s warmest recorded intrusions of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13948716407200785438", "cites_id": ["13948716407200785438"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020jc016998", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HqTdO6vLk8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
