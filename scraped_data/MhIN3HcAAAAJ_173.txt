Cruise au0803 focused on the Antarctic continental margin in the region of the Ad\u00e9lie Depression and on the southern end of the CLIVAR/WOCE meridional repeat section SR3, as part of the CASO oceanographic and CEAMARC biological programs. Cruise au0806 completed the CASO oceanographic program, with a full occupation of the SR3 transect between Antarctica and Tasmania, and included GEOTRACES program trace metal work. This report discusses only the CASO oceanographic data from these cruises."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11897967473137459843", "cites_id": ["11897967473137459843"], "pub_url": "https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/8285/a0803_a0806.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:g6KC8WASHqUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
