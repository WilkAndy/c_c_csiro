This necessitates expanding the current system to include biogeochemical and ecosystem observations. There was also an unambiguous message that various gaps in the system need to be closed\u2013in terms of technology, sampling, and geographical coverage. Closer integration is needed to exploit synergies between platforms and communities, and to provide seamless data access across all components. Capacity building and training the next generation of ocean observers is another area requiring work and funding. This paper argues that an efficient way forward is to (1) maintain the existing system,(2) close gaps, especially geographic ones, and (3) enhance Argo, OceanSITES (OCEAN Sustained Interdisciplinary Time series Environment Observation System) and VOS (Volunteer Observing Ship) to serve and be jointly operated with the biogeochemistry and ecosystem communities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11315175051690111822", "cites_id": ["11315175051690111822"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/44336820/Towards_an_integrated_Global_Observing_S20160402-29970-wlwci5.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TvNZV8KTB50J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1}}
