Sea-ice growth was estimated and found to vary from 4.8\u00b11. 7, 4.1\u00b11.5, 8.4\u00b11.7 cm day-1 respectively over a three week period. The average growth rate of sea-ice in the Mertz Glacier polynya is 5.8 cm day-1. Near the Mertz Glacier polynya the ocean heat flux is between 15\u00b16 and 43\u00b111 W m-2, with an average of 30 W m- 2 and the latent heat budget is between 125\u00b145 to 254\u00b152 W m-2, with an average of 174 W m-2. These estimates agree with ship-based measurements of sea-ice observed during the experiment. It is concluded that during winter the Mertz polynya is primarily a latent heat polynya."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7384844667993750097", "cites_id": ["7384844667993750097"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.utas.edu.au/22347/1/whole_WilliamsGuyDarvill2004_thesis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UXo0VRk9fGYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
