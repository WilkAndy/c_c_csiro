The primary purpose of the WOCE repeat section SR3 is to measure the exchange between the Indian and Pacific Oceans south of Australia. This paper describes the fronts, water masses and transport observed on the first occupation of the repeat section. The Subantarctic Front (SAF) is located between 50\u00b0S and 51\u00b0S and is the most striking feature of the vertical sections. Two additional fronts at 53\u00b0S and 59\u00b0S are associated with the Polar Front (PF), part of which turns northward to flow along the section before turning back to the east near 53\u00b0S. Very deep (>500m) mixed layers are found north of the SAF, confirming that Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) is formed in this region by deep convection in winter. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 268, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2879091188098663873", "cites_id": ["2879091188098663873"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063799000138", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wQWUdi6W9CcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 13, "2001": 32, "2002": 22, "2003": 11, "2004": 18, "2005": 12, "2006": 11, "2007": 13, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 13, "2012": 12, "2013": 13, "2014": 16, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 2}}
