As a main heat store for the world it has shown rapid and accelerating change in sea temperatures over the last few decades and has buffered many of the changes seen on land attributed to climate warming. It is the main store of carbon dioxide (CO 2), each year taking in about 2 petagram (2 x 10 15 g) from the atmosphere and exporting carbon via physical and biological processes to the deep ocean reservoir. Increases in sea temperature and changing planktonic systems and ocean currents may lead to a reduction in the uptake of CO 2 by the ocean; some evidence suggests the suppression of parts of the marine carbon sink are already underway. While the oceans have buffered climate change through the uptake of nearly 50% of CO 2 produced by fossil fuel burning this has already had an impact on ocean chemistry and will continue to do so. Feedbacks to climate change from ocean acidification may result from the expected impacts on marine organisms, ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. These and other topics were discussed at a workshop of international experts held in London in March 2008. The meeting, sponsored by WWF, addressed key feedback processes from the ocean to the climate and included discussions on ocean acidification, ocean fertilization and the role of changes in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans and globally. This document focuses on processes specifically relevant to the OSPAR region and does not include commentary on changes of a more global nature, such as the Monsoons \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8565266828102042033", "cites_id": ["8565266828102042033"], "pub_url": "http://charlie-gibbs.org/charlie/NEA_Website/Publication/Submissions/OSPAR2008/WWF_OSPAR08_climate_change_Annex2.doc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sYF1p8zw3XYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
