Cent., Hobart, Australia", "abstract": "Oceanographic measurements were collected aboard Aurora Australis cruise au1402, voyage 2 2014/2015, from 5th December 2014 to 25th January 2015. The cruise commenced with a Casey resupply, followed by work around the Dalton Polynya/Moscow University Iceshelf/Totten Glacier system, and then around the Mertz Glacier region. A total of 141 CTD vertical profile stations were taken on the cruise, most to within 11 metres of the bottom (Table 1.1). Over 1000 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate+ nitrite and silicate), dissolved inorganic carbon (ie TCO2), alkalinity, helium, 18O, and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Full depth current profiles were collected by an LADCP attached to the CTD package, and bottom video footage was collected by a camera system (also mounted to the CTD package) for most casts. Upper water column current profile data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP. An underway CTD system (PI Alex Orsi, Texas A&M University) was used to collected measurements from the aft of the ship along several small transects around the Dalton Polynya. Meteorological and water property data were collected by the array of ship's underway sensors. 10 \u2018Argo equivalent\u2019floats were also deployed in both the Totten and Mertz regions (Table 1.12), for an ice float pilot study."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2484549474277125708", "cites_id": ["2484549474277125708"], "pub_url": "https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/16417/09AR20141205_do.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TO4rSZXkeiIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1}}
