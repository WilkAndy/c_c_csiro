The workshops were held jointly between CSIRO Marine Research and CSIRO Atmospheric Research to examine observed and predicted climate change scenarios, climate variability studies and marine biological impacts in the south-east region.The workshops were motivated by growing evidence for changes in both physical and biological distributions in south-east Australia. The unique 50-year record from Maria Island shows that temperature and salinity increased significantly in recent decades, with the largest changes occurring in autumn and spring, and trends for all months except July being well above global rates. The Maria Island record also shows significant decadal variability. The temperature and salinity changes are consistent with a seasonally-modulated strengthening of the poleward extension of the East Australian Current (EAC). A preliminary analysis of the ocean response to changes in wind forcing over the same time period indicates that the observed changes in ocean temperatures are driven by a poleward shift and strengthening of the Westerly Winds. Recent analyses of deepwater corals suggest that the poleward extension of the EAC has been increasing over the last few centuries, causing warming near the sea surface and cooling at depths of the counter current."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12755052308862222519", "cites_id": ["12755052308862222519"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vincent-Lyne/publication/364305107_Regional_impacts_of_climate_change_and_variability_in_southeast_Australia_Report_of_a_joint_review_by_CSIRO_Marine_Research_and_CSIRO_Atmospheric_Research/links/6344ae9eff870c55ce166214/Regional-impacts-of-climate-change-and-variability-in-southeast-Australia-Report-of-a-joint-review-by-CSIRO-Marine-Research-and-CSIRO-Atmospheric-Research.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:t0BC6X4MA7EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2}}
