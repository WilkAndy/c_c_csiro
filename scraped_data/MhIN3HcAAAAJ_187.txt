The suite of instruments deployed incorporates both well established ideas of oceanographic experimentation, as well as novel approaches. The former is represented by a seven element mooring array, where each sub-surface mooring supported 1-5 current meters and up to 2 additional temperature sensors from 300 m to as deep as 3200 m. Straddling this local dynamics array, and extending approximately 450 km along a NNE-SSW line, is an array of 13 horizontal electrometers (HEMs) and 18 inverted echo sounders (IESs). These seafloor instruments are well suited for observing currents at mid-to high latitudes where large vertical scales dominate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8125827203981197634", "cites_id": ["8125827203981197634"], "pub_url": "http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/dluther/SAFDE/WOCE_SAFDE_poster.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QkGBH8q8xHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
