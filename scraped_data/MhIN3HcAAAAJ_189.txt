While recent research has advanced understanding of CDW heat transport onto the continental shelf, the fate of CDW on the shelf is less understood. Here, we use Lagrangian particle tracking in an ocean\u2010sea ice model without ice shelf cavities to map the residence time of CDW on the Antarctic continental shelf. Mean residence times vary from 1 month in the East Antarctic to 1 year in the West Antarctic. In regions of dense water formation, transformation of CDW on the shelf limits access of CDW to ice shelves, despite strong onshore CDW heat transport. Elsewhere transformation of CDW on the shelf is weak, implying that temperature on the shelf is limited by heat transport onto the shelf or the offshore heat reservoir."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12033192536390704841", "cites_id": ["12033192536390704841"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL096092", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yR5zddt8_qYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
