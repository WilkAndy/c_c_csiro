The IDP2017 includes data from the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, Southern and Indian oceans, with about twice the data volume of the previous IDP2014. For the first time, the IDP2017 contains data for a large suite of biogeochemical parameters as well as aerosol and rain data characterising atmospheric trace element and isotope (TEI) sources. The TEI data in the IDP2017 are quality controlled by careful assessment of intercalibration results and multi-laboratory data comparisons at crossover stations. The IDP2017 consists of two parts: (1) a compilation of digital data for more than 450 TEIs as well as standard hydrographic parameters, and (2) the eGEOTRACES Electronic Atlas providing an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 263, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17144876675016724604", "cites_id": ["17144876675016724604"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254118302961", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fJBAnH_W7u0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 10, "2019": 52, "2020": 77, "2021": 61, "2022": 51, "2023": 12}}
