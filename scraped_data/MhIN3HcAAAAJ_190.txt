At Mauna Loa, Hawaii, the annual CO2 concentration increased by a record 3.1 ppm, exceeding 400 ppm for the first time on record. The 2015 global CO2 average neared this threshold, at 399.4 ppm. Additionally, one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o events since at least 1950 developed in spring 2015 and continued to evolve through the year. The phenomenon was far reaching, impacting many regions across the globe and affecting most aspects of the climate system. Owing to the combination of El Ni\u00f1o and a long-term upward trend, Earth observed record warmth for the second consecutive year, with the 2015 annual global surface temperature surpassing the previous record by more than 0.1\u00b0C and exceeding the average for the mid- to late 19th century\u2014commonly considered representative of preindustrial conditions\u2014by more than 1\u00b0C for the first time. Above Earth\u2019s surface, lower troposphere temperatures were near-record high. Across land surfaces, record to near-record warmth was reported across every inhabited continent. Twelve countries, including Russia and China, reported record high annual temperatures. In June, one of the most severe heat waves since 1980 affected Karachi, Pakistan, claiming over 1000 lives. On 27 October, Vredendal, South Africa, reached 48.4\u00b0C, a new global high temperature record for this month. In the Arctic, the 2015 land surface temperature was 1.2\u00b0C above the 1981\u20132010 average, tying 2007 and 2011 for the highest annual temperature and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14985426767783802951", "cites_id": ["14985426767783802951"], "pub_url": "https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:research.vu.nl:publications%2Fc967bd3a-41ec-4c38-8f4b-bc03b797cf7b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RzhixT_u9s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
