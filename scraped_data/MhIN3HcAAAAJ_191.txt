Changes have already been observed in the Southern Ocean, but we are only beginning to describe and understand the extent and consequences of these changes. Supporting a strong, focused scientific effort on Southern Ocean change and maintaining the capacity for continued integrated observations and strategic research is vital to understanding global climate change and its impacts on Australia.  The latest research shows:      The Southern Ocean is warming faster than the average for the global ocean.       The warming extends to greater depth in the Southern Ocean than it does in low latitudesbecause of the unique ocean currents there that carry heat deep in the ocean. The large amount of heat stored in the ocean makes it expand, raising sea levels.       These currents also carry large amounts of carbon dioxide into the deep ocean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4081548204313075675", "cites_id": ["4081548204313075675"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4081548204313075675&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:29-2g3eSpDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
