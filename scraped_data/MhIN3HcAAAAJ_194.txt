The strongest historical trend observed in the abyssal ocean is warming at high southern latitudes 2, 3, 4, yet it is unclear what processes have driven this warming, and whether this warming is linked to a slowdown in the ocean\u2019s overturning circulation. Furthermore, attributing change to specific drivers is difficult owing to limited measurements, and because coupled climate models exhibit biases in the region 5, 6, 7. In addition, future change remains uncertain, with the latest coordinated climate model projections not accounting for dynamic ice-sheet melt. Here we use a transient forced high-resolution coupled ocean\u2013sea-ice model to show that under a high-emissions scenario, abyssal warming is set to accelerate over the next 30 years.
