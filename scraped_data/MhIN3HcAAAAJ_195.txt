Previous modeling studies show that the vorticity balance characterizing standing meanders in the upper ocean is dominated by advection of relative vorticity and stretching. Through the adjustment of this vorticity balance, standing meanders have been suggested to provide a pathway for the transfer of the momentum input by the wind from the surface to the bottom, leading to stronger bottom flows and energy dissipation. However, the dynamics governing the meander formation and its adjustment to wind remain unclear. Here we develop a quasigeostrophic theory and combine it with a regional model of the Macquarie Ridge region and an idealized channel model to explore the dynamics and vertical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9867839886981447764", "cites_id": ["9867839886981447764"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/53/1/JPO-D-22-0086.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VMD1Wxic8YgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 3}}
