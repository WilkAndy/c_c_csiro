However, few studies have used observations to diagnose the dynamics of ACC standing meanders. We use a synoptic hydrographic survey and satellite altimetry to explore the momentum and vorticity balance of a Subantarctic Front standing meander, downstream of the Southeast Indian Ridge. Along-stream anomalies of temperature in the upper ocean (150\u2013600 m) show along-stream cooling entering the surface trough and along-stream warming entering the surface crest, while warming is observed from trough to crest in the deeper ocean (600\u20131500 m). Advection of relative vorticity is balanced by vortex stretching, as found in model studies of meandering currents.
