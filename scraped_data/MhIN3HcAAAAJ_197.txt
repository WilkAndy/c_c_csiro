For this purpose, observations of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) from two summer hydrographic surveys in 2015 and 2017 were paired with DSW volume transport estimates derived from a coupled ocean\u2010sea ice\u2010ice shelf model to examine the fate of inorganic carbon in DSW from Ad\u00e9lie Land. Transports indicate a net outflow of 227 \u00b1 115 Tg C yr\u22121 with DSW in the postglacial calving configuration of the Mertz Polynya. The greatest outflow of inorganic carbon from the shelf region was delivered through the northern boundary across the Ad\u00e9lie and Mertz Sills, with an additional transport westward from the Mertz Polynya. Inorganic carbon in DSW is derived primarily from inflowing TCO2\u2010rich modified \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13449143987181198461", "cites_id": ["13449143987181198461"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JC016302", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fRwEITP1pLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3}}
