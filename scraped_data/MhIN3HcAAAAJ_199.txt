The word conjures up images of mountains draped with glaciers, ferocious seas dotted with icebergs and iconic species found nowhere else. The continent includes about one-tenth of the planet's land surface, nearly 90% of Earth's ice and about 70% of its fresh water. Its encircling ocean supports Patagonian toothfish and krill fisheries, and is crucial for regulating climate and the uptake of carbon dioxide by sea water."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1240041770317233945", "cites_id": ["1240041770317233945"], "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/polar-research-six-priorities-for-antarctic-science", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Gb9nimuDNREJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3}}
