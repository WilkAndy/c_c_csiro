In Part 2 we have used maps of SSH to examine the variability of the ACC fronts between 1992 and 2007. The SSH label associated with each frontal branch is nearly constant around the circumpolar belt. The front labels are also nearly constant in time: the bands of enhanced SSH gradient (i.e., fronts) occur along the same streamlines throughout the 15 year period of observations. Both short\u2010 and long\u2010period changes of the SSH frontal labels of the ACC are small. Based on a tight relationship between dynamic height and cumulative baroclinic transport of the ACC, the baroclinic transport variability of the individual branches of the ACC is also expected to be small.
