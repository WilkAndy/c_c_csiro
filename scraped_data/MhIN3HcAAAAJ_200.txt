Strong cooling and freshening is observed on isopycnals for layers denser than \u03b3 n= 28. 30. Changes in aver-5 age salinity and potential temperature below this isopycnal correspond to basin-wide warming of 1300\u00b1200 TW and freshening of 24\u00b13 Gt yr\u2212 1. While freshening can be explained by freshening of major source waters, ie, the High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) of the Ross Sea and the dense shelf water formed in the Ad\u00e9lie and George V Land (AGVL) region, extensive warming of the AABW cannot be explained by warm-10 ing of the source waters. A possible cause of warming of the AABW is a decrease in supply of the Ross Sea Bottom Water (RSBW). Hydrographic profiles between the Drygalski Trough of the Western Ross Sea and 150\u25e6 E were analyzed in the context of a simple advective-diffusive model to assess the causes of the observed changes. The RSBW has also warmed by a larger amount than its source water (the HSSW). 15 The model suggests that the warming of the RSBW observed between the 1970s and 2000s can be explained by a 21\u00b123% reduction in transport of the RSBW and an enhancement of the vertical diffusion of heat as a result of a 30\u00b17% weakening of the abyssal stratification. Freshening of the HSSW reduced the salinity and density stratification between the bottom water layer and overlying ambient water. Hence, freshening 20 of the HSSW both directly freshened and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=822458823566602301", "cites_id": ["822458823566602301"], "pub_url": "https://os.copernicus.org/preprints/8/2197/2011/osd-8-2197-2011.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PbASRfH1aQsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
