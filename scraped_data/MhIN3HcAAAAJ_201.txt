The cruise commenced with a full north to south occupation of the CLIVAR/WOCE meridional repeat section SR3, followed by work around the Antarctic continental margin in the region of the Ad\u00e9lie Depression and the former Mertz Glacier ice tongue (Figure 1). Bottom imaging camera work was conducted during the Antarctic phase, as part of the CEAMARC biological program. This report discusses the oceanographic data from the cruise."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13761208744999552563", "cites_id": ["13761208744999552563"], "pub_url": "https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/3763/a1121.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M4ayjXGi-b4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
