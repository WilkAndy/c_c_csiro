The research is organized in five themes: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in the global water cycle; Southern hemisphere teleconnections; Climate processes at the Antarctic continental margin; Climate \u2013 ecosystem \u2013 biogeochemistry interactions in the Southern Ocean; and Records of past Antarctic climate variability and change. To address these themes, an integrated IPY Southern Ocean observing system is needed. The observing system will include synoptic, multidisciplinary ocean transects; time series measurements; enhanced atmospheric measurements; and new paleoclimate data sets. The Southern Ocean IPY will leave a legacy of a targeted, affordable, sustained observing system and a circumpolar snap-shot to serve as a benchmark for the assessment of past and future change. The observations will inform development of models capable of improved projections of future change."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1921104573858794723", "cites_id": ["1921104573858794723"], "pub_url": "http://nopr.niscpr.res.in/handle/123456789/3350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:40w7dW4iqRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
