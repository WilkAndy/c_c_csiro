However, not all polynyas form DSW. We examine how the physiographic setting, water\u2010mass distribution and transformation, water column stratification, and sea\u2010ice production regulate DSW formation in four East Antarctic coastal polynyas. We use a salt budget to estimate the relative contribution of sea\u2010ice production and lateral advection to the monthly change in salinity in each polynya. DSW forms in Mackenzie polynya due to a combination of physical features (shallow water depth and a broad continental shelf) and high sea\u2010ice production. Sea\u2010ice formation begins early (March) in Mackenzie polynya, counteracting fresh advection and establishing a salty mixed layer in autumn that preconditions the water column for deep convection in winter. Sea\u2010ice production is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5489821498540162459", "cites_id": ["5489821498540162459"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JC018804", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m_3JDJHDL0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
