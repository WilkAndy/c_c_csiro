Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation in MP shows large spatial variability that is related to the (a) local bathymetry, (b) water column preconditioning from the presence/absence of different water masses, and (c) proximity to the Amery Ice Shelf meltwater outflow. MP exhibits sustained sea ice production and brine rejection (thus, salinity increase) from April to October. However, new DSW is only formed from June onward, when the mixed layer deepens and convection is strong enough to break the stratification set by Antarctic Surface Water above and Ice Shelf Water below. We found no evidence of DSW export from MP to Darnley polynya, as previously suggested. Rather, our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14386421028247164126", "cites_id": ["14386421028247164126"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021jc017748", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3tTh4bPVpscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
