The maps reveal that the ACC consists of multiple filaments or jets. By averaging surface chlorophyll measurements along streamlines, we show that the fronts define the limits of zones with similar concentrations and seasonality of surface chlorophyll. The overall pattern of surface chlorophyll is consistent with strongest upwelling of nutrient\u2010rich deep water south of the Polar Front (PF). However, the distribution of chlorophyll in the Southern Ocean is concentrated in a number of persistent blooms, observed downstream of islands and bathymetric features. In contrast to previous studies, we find little evidence that the fronts of the ACC are associated with enhanced productivity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4953402923574056843", "cites_id": ["4953402923574056843"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006jc004072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:i1cD-bYFvkQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 12, "2009": 6, "2010": 12, "2011": 15, "2012": 17, "2013": 9, "2014": 27, "2015": 27, "2016": 21, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 15, "2020": 19, "2021": 15, "2022": 17, "2023": 7}}
