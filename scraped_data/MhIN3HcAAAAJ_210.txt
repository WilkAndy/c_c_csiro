The calving of the 2500 km2 ice tongue also changed the geography of the region, with unknown consequences for the global ocean overturning circulation and climate. But within a year of the calving the Australian Antarctic Division assembled a team of scientists to make the first observations of the new environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16820486646983855568", "cites_id": ["16820486646983855568"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.143953631364739", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0I2slnxfbukJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
