The original design of the Argomission specified nominal 3 x 3 degree spacing, with 10 daysampling interval, of the oceans between 60 \u00b0N and 60 \u00b0S,excluding the high latitudes and marginal seas. The exclusionof the high latitudes was due to the inability of early floats tosample under sea-ice. Technological advances in float designin recent years now give us this capability. Advancements havecome through re-design of hardware (i.e. armoured ice floats),software (ice-avoidance algorithm and open-water test) andcommunications (Iridium), allowing the transmission of storedwinter profiles. Observing circulation in seasonally ice-coveredseas is challenging. To date, most observations have beenmade during ice-free summer periods and consequently thewinter circulation beneath the sea-ice is not well understood.Despite this, Argo has already made a significant contribution tohigh latitude research with successful deployments of floats inthe polar oceans of both hemispheres. As of December 2008,over 100 floats had been deployed above 60 \u00b0N and over 200below 60 \u00b0S. Approximately 60% of these floats are still active(the failure rate of early floats was high as the ice-capabletechnology was being developed and tested). Mortality rates ofnewer ice floats are now equivalent to those deployed in lessdemanding conditions. In fact, a number of floats deployed inthe Weddell Sea have survived for 7 years (surpassing 225profiles) equal to some \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6828697675565126018", "cites_id": ["6828697675565126018"], "pub_url": "https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/21402/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:glGYHltoxF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2}}
