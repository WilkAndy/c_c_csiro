The depth of this layer is determined by wind forcing and heating from the atmosphere. Variations in mixed-layer depth affect the rate of exchange between the atmosphere and deeper ocean, the capacity of the ocean to store heat and carbon and the availability of light and nutrients to support the growth of phytoplankton. However, the response of the Southern Ocean mixed layer to changes in the atmosphere is not well known. Here we analyse temperature and salinity data from Argo profiling floats to show that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), the dominant mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere, leads to large-scale anomalies in mixed-layer depth that are zonally asymmetric. From a simple heat budget of the mixed layer we conclude that meridional winds associated with departures of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 246, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3818309509095325094", "cites_id": ["3818309509095325094"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pn0frERc_TQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 7, "2011": 12, "2012": 15, "2013": 16, "2014": 23, "2015": 24, "2016": 20, "2017": 23, "2018": 21, "2019": 15, "2020": 15, "2021": 22, "2022": 19, "2023": 12}}
