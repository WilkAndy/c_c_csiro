Data are recorded on magnetic tape and real time is calculated. Time averaging is required to remove effects of ship motion. An intercomparison is made with a moored vector measuring current meter (VMCM). The mean difference in hourly averaged APOC and VMCM currents over the four hour intercomparison is a few mm s minus including: two Gulf Stream crossings, a warm core ring survey, and shallow water in a frontal zone to the east of Nantucket Shoals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3602848126815369014", "cites_id": ["3602848126815369014"], "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19830005500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NveCWkjj_zEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1}}
