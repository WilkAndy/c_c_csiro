AABW forms on the Antarctic continental shelf, sinks down the continental slope and partially fills the ocean\u2019s abyss, accounting for about 36% of the global ocean\u2019s volume (Johnson, 2008) and representing a primary ventilation pathway of the deep ocean (Purkey and Johnson, 2013; Newsom et al., 2016). AABW has become warmer and fresher in recent decades (Rintoul, 2007; Jacobs and Giulivi, 2010; Schmidtko et al., 2014; van Wijk and Rintoul, 2014), therefore contracting in volume and contributing to sea-level changes (Church et al., 2011; Purkey and Johnson, 2013). However, the mechanisms driving change in AABW are not yet fully understood (Silvano, 2020).Processes on the Antarctic shelf influence present and future climate largely through water mass transformations occurring on the continental shelf and under the ice shelves. Dense Shelf Water (DSW) forms in coastal polynyas (Orsi et al., 1999; Tamura et al., 2011), where strong buoyancy loss (due to cooling and brine rejection during sea-ice formation) produces the dense water that ultimately is exported from the shelf to form AABW. Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), a relatively warm and salty water with origins in the subpolar North Atlantic, upwells around the Antarctic continent and in some locations reaches ice shelf cavities; being relatively warm, CDW drives strong ice shelf basal melting and mass loss (Jacobs et al., 1992; Pritchard et al., 2012; Schmidtko et al., 2014; Rignot et al., 2019)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7284207680408290550", "cites_id": ["7284207680408290550"], "pub_url": "https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/357114/fmars_10_1027704.pdf?sequence=1", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
