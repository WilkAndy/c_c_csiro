Despite its pivotal role in organizing ocean circulation, the processes governing the formation of the internal pycnocline remain little understood. Classical theories on pycnocline formation have been couched in terms of temperature and it is not clear how the theory applies in the high\u2010latitude Southern Ocean, where stratification is dominated by salinity. Here we assess the mechanisms generating the internal pycnocline at southern high latitudes through the analysis of a high\u2010resolution, realistic, global sea ice\u2013ocean model. We show evidence suggesting that the internal pycnocline's formation is associated with sea ice\u2010ocean interactions in two distinct ice\u2010covered regions, fringing the Antarctic continental slope and the winter sea\u2010ice edge. In both areas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14004940924574118210", "cites_id": ["14004940924574118210"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JC019113", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
