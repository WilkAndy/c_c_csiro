Despite its pivotal role in organizing ocean circulation, the processes governing the formation of the permanent pycnocline remain little understood. Two factors in particular are generally overlooked: the presence of a zonal channel in the Southern Ocean, and the nonlinear interplay between temperature and salinity distributions. Here we assess the mechanism generating the Southern Ocean\u2019s permanent pycnocline through the analysis of a high-resolution, realistic, global sea ice-ocean model. We show that the permanent pycnocline is formed by seasonal sea ice-ocean interactions in two distinct ice-covered regions, fringing the Antarctic continental slope and the winter sea ice edge. In both areas, persistent sea ice melt leads to the formation of strong \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16075404216326580563", "cites_id": ["16075404216326580563"], "pub_url": "https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10510516.1", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
