Measurements of INPs active in the immersion freezing mode were made in real time with a Continuous Flow Diffusion Chamber (CFDC) at temperatures below-25, and via offline analyses of aerosol filter and seawater samples using the Colorado State University Ice Spectrometers (IS) from-10 to-28. An identical CFDC and aerosol filters were on-board the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft during the concurrent Southern Ocean Cloud Radiation Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES), which collected INP measurements in the MBL, below and above cloud, and in the free troposphere in the same region as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:LPtt_HFRSbwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3932211379596804504", "cites_id": ["3932211379596804504"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMA054...03M/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mMGdfmoFkjYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
