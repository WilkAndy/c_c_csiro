However, the impact of localized injection of heat by hydrothermal vents where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current interacts with mid\u2010ocean ridges remains poorly understood. Here a circumpolar compilation of helium and physical measurements are used to show that while geothermal heat is transferred to the ocean over a broad area by conduction, heat transfer by convection dominates near hydrothermal vents. Buoyant hydrothermal plumes decrease stratification above the vent source and increase stratification to the south, altering the local vertical diffusivity and diapycnal upwelling within 500 m of the sea floor by an order of magnitude. Both the helium tracer and stratification signals \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=243564080823005812", "cites_id": ["243564080823005812"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL080410", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dPJ_tT1QYQMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
