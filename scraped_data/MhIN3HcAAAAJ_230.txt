Reducing the uncertainty of ice sheet behaviour is important since the two great parts of Antarctica \u2013 the East and West Antarctic ice sheets \u2013 hold around 70 per cent of the world\u2019s fresh water and more than 90 per cent of its ice. If the ice sheet melted completely, global mean sea level would rise by about 60 metres, although the likelihood of this occurring over the next two centuries is low."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7300857171032457873", "cites_id": ["7300857171032457873"], "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/124749/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kcJAW-raUWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
