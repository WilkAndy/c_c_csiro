Basal melt driven by ocean heat flux has been linked to ice shelf thinning elsewhere in Antarctica, but no oceanographic measurements had been made near the Totten. In January 2015 the RSV Aurora Australis was the first ship to reach the Totten calving front. Observations from ship-board CTD, moorings and profiling floats provide direct confirmation that warm water reaches the ice shelf cavity. Warm water is present near the sea floor at every station deeper than 300 m depth, with maximum temperatures at mid-shelf> 0.5 C. Mooring data confirm that the warm water is present year-round. A deep (> 1100 m) channel at the calving front allows warm water (-0.4 C,> 2 C above the local freezing point) to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13850971282268062336", "cites_id": ["13850971282268062336"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.C11D..08O/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gIK54f6IOMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
