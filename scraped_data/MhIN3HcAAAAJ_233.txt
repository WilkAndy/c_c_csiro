Combining this trend with a time evolving satellite GEM (satGEM) projection of the temperature and salinity fields resolves the change in Southern Ocean heat and freshwater content into an adiabatic component driven by frontal movement, and a diabatic part driven by fluxes of heat and freshwater. The southward trend of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) fronts drives a net adiabatic warming equivalent to 0.056\u00b10.004 PW over most of the ACC and over all depths in the satGEM. This is strongest at the SubAntarctic Front (SAF). The deep water masses tend to freshen, while SubAntarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) increase in salinity for a net trend of 0.009\u00b10.001 Sv.
