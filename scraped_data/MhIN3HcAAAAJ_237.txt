While the past decade has seen a rapidly growing appreciation of the role of the Southern Ocean and Antarctica in the global climate system, a lack of observations continues to hinder attempts to understand how the region drives and responds to climate change and variability. The International Polar Year (IPY) presents an opportunity to fill this gap. The Climate of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (CASO) programme, led through the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, aims to obtain the first circumpolar snapshot of the physical environment of the Southern Ocean, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1979978695034195888", "cites_id": ["1979978695034195888"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.020918547745989", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sM9a_CFMehsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
