In general, the interannual temperature variations in the upper 700 m result from the meridional shifts in the position of the main fronts rather than from downward propagation of temperature anomalies generated at the sea surface. The latter is predominant in the region of Subantarctic Mode Water formation and possibly near Antarctic continental margin. The subsurface temperature changes include variations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) frequency band (with periods of 2 {7 years) and longer period signals. Sea surface temperature data show the variability is of comparable magnitude in these two frequency bands (meridional mean standard deviation of 0.25 C and 0.19 C respectively). The low frequency variability strongly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17019967872396790626", "cites_id": ["17019967872396790626"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17019967872396790626&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YovFspoSM-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1}}
