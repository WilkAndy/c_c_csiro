Ventilation resulting from Ekman pumping is estimated from satellite winds, the geostrophic mean component is assessed from a climatology strengthened with Argo data, and the eddy-induced advection is included via the parameterization of Gent and McWilliams, together with eddy mixing estimates. All three components contribute significantly to ventilation. Finally, the seasonal cycle of the upper ocean is resolved using Argo data.The circumpolar-averaged circulation shows an upwelling in the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) density classes, which is carried north into a zone of dense Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) subduction. Although no consistent net production is found \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 237, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11883109537620307194", "cites_id": ["11883109537620307194"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/40/3/2009jpo4291.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-izqQCpJ6aQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 10, "2011": 16, "2012": 16, "2013": 22, "2014": 15, "2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 19, "2019": 21, "2020": 17, "2021": 26, "2022": 29, "2023": 13}}
