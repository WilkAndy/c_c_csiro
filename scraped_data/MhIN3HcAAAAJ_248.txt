Understanding of the processes driving change in SAMW is therefore needed to assess the ocean\u2019s capacity to store heat and carbon. An analysis of Argo data reveals that the SAMW thickness increased in the eastern subduction area of the South Indian Ocean (SIO) during 2005\u2212 2020, and decreased in the central SIO outside the subduction area. The increasing and decreasing trends of SAMW thickness are driven by enhanced subduction and by erosion through mixing with warmer overlying waters, respectively. The changes in SAMW subduction re ect changes in air-sea exchange. Trends in winter sea level pressure associated with an ampli cation of the winter atmospheric zonal wave 3 pattern caused increased equatorward ow and marine cold air outbreaks in the eastern SIO, driving larger ocean heat loss, deeper mixed layers, and stronger subduction by lateral induction. SAMW subducts beneath lighter waters that warmed during the 2005\u2212 2020 period. Mixing with the warmer overlying water eroded the upper part of the SAMW layer, causing deepening of the SAMW low potential vorticity core, and thinning of the SAMW in the central SIO. These results demonstrate that both anomalous meridional atmospheric circulation and erosion by interior mixing in uence the thickness, and hence heat and carbon storage capacity, of the SAMW."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2010099/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nM3kAgs3PCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
