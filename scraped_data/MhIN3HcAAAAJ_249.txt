However, not all polynyas form DSW. In this study, we analyse the main drivers of DSW formation in four East Antarctic polynyas: Mackenzie, Barrier, Shackelton and Vincennes Bay from west to east. Mackenzie and Barrier (in lesser extent) were the only two polynyas where DSW formation was observed while it is absent in Shackelton and Vincennes Bay in the particular years when they were best sampled. We analysed the role of Bathymetry, water-mass distribution and transformation, stratification of the water column, sea-ice production rate and associated salt advection. We found that sea ice production was highest in Mackenzie, particularly in early winter, which likely contributed to reach higher salinity than the other polynyas at the beginning of the sea ice formation season \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EGUGA..24.1558P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
