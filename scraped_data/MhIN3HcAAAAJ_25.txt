The mean top\u2010to\u2010bottom volume transport is 147\u00b110 Sv (mean \u00b11 standard deviation), relative to a deep reference level consistent with water mass properties and float trajectories. The location and transport of the main fronts of the ACC are relatively steady: the Subantarctic Front carries 105\u00b17 Sv at a mean latitude between 51\u00b0 and 52\u00b0S; the northern branch of the Polar Front carries 5\u00b15 Sv to the east between 53\u00b0 and 54\u00b0S; the southern Polar Front carries 24\u00b13 Sv eastward at 59\u00b0S; and two cores of the southern ACC front at 62\u00b0 and 64\u00b0S carry 18\u00b13 and 11\u00b13 Sv, respectively. The variability in net property transports is largely due to variability of currents north of the ACC, in particular, an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 233, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12555696150466816787", "cites_id": ["12555696150466816787"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000JC900107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E2tQPCDLPq4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 13, "2002": 13, "2003": 12, "2004": 17, "2005": 11, "2006": 9, "2007": 14, "2008": 11, "2009": 5, "2010": 12, "2011": 9, "2012": 16, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 8, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 4, "2019": 10, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
