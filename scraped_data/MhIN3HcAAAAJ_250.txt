The formation of AABW includes mixing of distinct water masses, such as High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), Ice Shelf Water (ISW) and Circumpolar Deep Water on the continental shelf. Despite its climatic importance, the mechanisms of AABW formation are poorly known due to the lack of observations and the inability of climate models to simulate those mechanisms. We applied the Water Mass Transformation (WMT) framework in density space to simulations from a circumpolar ocean-ice shelf model (WAOM, with horizontal resolution ranging from 10 to 2 km) to understand the role of surface fluxes and oceanic processes to water mass formation and mixing on the Antarctic continental shelf, including the ice shelf cavities. The salt budget dominates the water mass transformation rates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EGUGA..2411231B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
