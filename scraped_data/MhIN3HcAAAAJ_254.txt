The relatively recent increases in deployments of biogeochemical floats (Claustre et al. 2020), Saildrone Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs; Sutton et al. 2021), and Deep Argo (Roemmich et al. 2019) have provided novel insights into seasonal and interannual variability in SO properties and fluxes. Here, we present 2020 anomalies of SO air\u2013sea heat and CO2 fluxes and show recent changes in mixed layer (ML) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) properties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:5bg8sr1QxYwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/147555/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5ZqiglRlkBAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
