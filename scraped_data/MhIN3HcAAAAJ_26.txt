In addition, in order to explore the role of sea ice in Hg cycling, a study of mercury speciation in the \u201csnow\u2013sea ice\u2013seawater\u201d continuum was conducted at a coastal site, near the Australian Casey station (66.40\u00b0S; 101.14\u00b0E). In the open ocean waters, total Hg (HgT) concentrations varied from 0.63 to 2.76 pmol L\u22121 with \u201ctransient-type\u201d vertical profiles and a latitudinal distribution suggesting an atmospheric mercury source south of the Southern Polar Front (SPF) and a surface removal north of the Subantartic Front (SAF). Slightly higher mean HgT concentrations (1.35 \u00b1 0.39 pmol L\u22121) were measured in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC", "num_citations": 231, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4766930007773609210", "cites_id": ["4766930007773609210"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703711002614", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-vx-9pWJJ0IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 16, "2013": 18, "2014": 24, "2015": 27, "2016": 15, "2017": 19, "2018": 14, "2019": 15, "2020": 28, "2021": 19, "2022": 28, "2023": 6}}
