When the current interacts with strong topography standing meanders, or stationary Rossby waves, can occur. Standing meanders steepen in response to a stronger current as a result of increasing wind stress upstream that steepen the isopycnals. This leads to instabilities in the flow generating more eddies, that flatten the isopycnals, slow down the ACC and lead to stronger poleward heat fluxes. This has implications for warming of the waters around Antarctica, leading to melting of sea ice and basal melt of ice shelves. We surveyed a standing meander in the Subantarctic Front downstream of the Southeast Indian Ridge with 11 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:1taIhTC69MYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140494280&h=bsMlMoW0MO3v5if3mc2Hbgzx3Wimr2s1RXt3PNNvkWPwnvoC8INm7X%2B7LR1UArxAYpLv%2Bm9RRApui8bNUqDEgg%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
