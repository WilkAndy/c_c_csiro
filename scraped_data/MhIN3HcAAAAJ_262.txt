Recent observations show that MCDW accesses the continental shelf through a depression at the shelf break. Here we show new oceanographic and bathymetric observations in the depression south of the shelf break that were collected for two consecutive years by profiling floats capable of drifting under sea ice. The depression provides a pathway for persistent inflow of warm (0-1 C) MCDW to the inner shelf. In Austral autumn and early winter MCDW intrusions are up to 0.5 C warmer and are~ 75 m thicker than in spring and summer. Using a combination of offshore observations and an ocean model, we propose that seasonality of the flow on the continental slope explains the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140486975&h=lIQAHBtEoQy6cBZAfrkRo8ruew00GLBL8YDwG%2Fk5pkKkk2Xol1s8TQfG3GkBoPdVEpdAVaKHU8Mlc4KqKD8eoQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
