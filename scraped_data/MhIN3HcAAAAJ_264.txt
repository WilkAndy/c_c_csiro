Previous observations of low ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations and recent modeling work support the idea that the SO INP population is dominated by SSA. These marine INPs are hypothesized to strongly influence the lifetime, formation, and optical properties of the supercooled and mixed phase clouds that are common in the region. Measurements of ice nucleating entities (INEs) in seawater and INPs and aerosols in the marine boundary layer were made during the Southern Ocean Cloud Radiation Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) and the associated Clouds, Aerosols, Precipitation Radiation and atmospherIc Composition Over the southeRN ocean (CAPRICORN \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.A13G2523M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
