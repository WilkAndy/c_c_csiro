We present the first dissolved neodymium (Nd) isotope and concentration measurements for ALBW. The summertime signature of ALBW is characterized by epsilon(Nd) = -8.9, distinct from Ross Sea Bottom Water, and similar to Weddell Sea Bottom Water. Adelie Land Shelf Water, the precursor water mass for wintertime ALBW, features the least radiogenic Nd fingerprint observed around Antarctica to date (epsilon(Nd) = -9.9). Local geology around Antarctica is important in setting the chemical signature of individual varieties of Antarctic Bottom Water, evident from the shelf water signature, which should be considered in the absence of direct wintertime observations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4177148974990734612&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
