We analysed 128 surface marine metagenomes, including 37 new Antarctic metagenomes. The large size of the data set enabled internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions to be obtained from the Southern polar region, enabling the first global characterization of the distribution of SAR11, from waters spanning temperatures \u22122 to 30\u00b0C. Our data show a stable co\u2010occurrence of phylotypes within both \u2018tropical\u2019 (>20\u00b0C) and \u2018polar\u2019 (<10\u00b0C) biomes, highlighting ecological niche differentiation between major SAR11 subgroups. All phylotypes display transitions in abundance that are strongly correlated with temperature and latitude. By assembling SAR11 genomes from Antarctic metagenome data, we identified specific genes, biases in gene functions and signatures of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 228, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2323735142299132722", "cites_id": ["2323735142299132722"], "pub_url": "https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2012.28", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MuPU3MyQPyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 18, "2014": 17, "2015": 14, "2016": 32, "2017": 22, "2018": 12, "2019": 30, "2020": 19, "2021": 27, "2022": 26, "2023": 7}}
