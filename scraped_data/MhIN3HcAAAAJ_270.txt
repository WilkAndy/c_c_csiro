It consists of two parts: (1) a compilation of digital data for more than 200 trace elements and isotopes (TEls) as well as classical hydrographic parameters, and (2) the eGEOTRACES Electronic Atlas providing a strongly inter-linked on-line atlas including more than 300 section plots and 90 animated 3D scenes. The IDP2014 covers the Atlantic, Arctic, and Indian oceans, exhibiting highest data density in the Atlantic. The TEI data in the IDP2014 are quality controlled by careful assessment of intercalibration results and multi-laboratory data comparisons at cross-over stations. The digital data are provided in several formats, including ASCII spreadsheet, Excel spreadsheet, netCDF, and Ocean \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9053744904154965650&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
