Key questions for understanding the consequences of change in the region include:(i) Will southward movement of the ocean fronts, as well as the extent of winter sea ice, give rise to a contraction in the northern range of polar species such as Antarctic krill?(ii) How will productivity of the region change as a result of changing attributes of physical habitats in areas of iron supply?(iii) What factors might give rise to a shift from a krill-based food web to a food web based on copepods and fish? These questions are central to management of fisheries and conservation in the region. Important to managers is the question on how to most efficiently monitor the ecosystem to determine whether such changes are arising or may arise in the near future. This last question is central to developing biological capability within the Southern Ocean Observing System.Drivers of food webs in the Southern Ocean include bottom topography, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), its associated fronts including its southern boundary, coastal currents and gyres, seasonal extent of sea ice, and locations of primary production, which are often associated with hot spots of iron supply. Our ability to answer the questions above will be determined, in part, by our ability to assess the relative importance of these drivers in Southern Ocean ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/14nm-sMY9wEn2P4HjxuvIcg3wtFdJ2gww/view", "cites_per_year": {}}
