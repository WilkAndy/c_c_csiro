The majority of AABW forms in three discrete locations around the Antarctic continent, the Weddell Sea (Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean), the Ross Sea (Pacific sector), and the Ad\u00e9lie Depression (~ 142-145 E,~ 66-67 S; Indian sector). Ad\u00e9lie Land Bottom Water (ALBW) is formed as dense shelf waters beneath coastal polynyas, and periodically overspills and is exported to the abyssal ocean. Previous work suggested that this particular water mass not only carries characteristic hydrographic properties, but that it may also carry a distinct radiogenic isotope composition, which would allow tracing local bottom water formation back in time. We here present new results for the Nd isotope composition and concentration of seawater collected during the GIPY6 voyage from Tasmania (Australia) to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMOS21G..07V/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
