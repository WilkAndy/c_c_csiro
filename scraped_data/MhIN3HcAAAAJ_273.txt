This talk addresses the main climate-related changes observed in ocean and the cryosphere, as well as their roles in the climate system. The ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the energy increase in the climate system in the last 40 years, with warming detected even in the abyss over the last few decades. The ocean has also taken up about 30% of the carbon released by fossil fuel burning and land use change since 1750, lowering the pH of (acidifying) near-surface waters. Relatively saline near-surface ocean waters, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline, and relatively fresh regions, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher; providing indirect evidence of change in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014EGUGA..16.2460R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
