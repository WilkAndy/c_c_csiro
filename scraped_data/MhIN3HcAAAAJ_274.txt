Measurements every 10 min for \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O and \u03b4D, 15 min for DIC yielded 2499 and 2289 discrete measurements respectively. High resolution data enabled the delineation of water mass boundaries as well as revealing insights into surface hydrological and biological processes. \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O, \u03b4D, and \u03b4\u00b9\u00b3CDIC decreased southwards, dropping by approximately 1.0\u2030, 7.0\u2030, and 0.5\u2030, respectively. Though the decline in \u03b4\u00b9\u00b3CDIC with latitude was generally linear, the drop in \u03b4\u00b9\u2078O and \u03b4D was punctuated by areas of rapid, significant change corresponding to the Sub-Tropical, Sub-Antarctic and Polar Fronts. North of the Sub-Antarctic Front (approx. 54.5\u00b0S) the dominant control on water and DIC isotopes was the precipitation\u2013evaporation balance and the contribution of upwelling waters, respectively. Further south, in close proximity to the sea ice and on the Antarctic shelf, water isotope values were more variable and predominantly influenced by the melting/freezing of sea-ice coupled to inputs from glacial/snow melt water. Local increases in \u03b4\u00b9\u00b3CDIC were likely due to photosynthetic enrichment of the DIC pool. Using this new instrumentation has provided one of the most comprehensive oceanic transect data sets yet achieved and illustrates the potential of these methods to delineate discrete water masses and advance our knowledge of both water and inorganic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/123379", "cites_per_year": {}}
