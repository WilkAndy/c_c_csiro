Measurements every 10 minutes for \u03b418O and \u03b4D, 15 minutes for DIC yielded 2,499 and 2,289 discrete measurements respectively. High resolution data enabled the delineation of water mass boundaries as well as revealing insights into surface hydrological and biological processes. \u03b418O, \u03b4D, and \u03b413CDIC decreased southwards, dropping by approximately 1.0\u2030, 7.0\u2030, and 0.5\u2030, respectively. Though the decline in \u03b413CDIC with latitude was generally linear, the drop in \u03b418O and \u03b4D was punctuated by areas of rapid, significant change corresponding to the Sub-Tropical, Sub-Antarctic and Polar Fronts. North of the Sub-Antarctic Front (approx. 54.5 S) the dominant control on water and DIC isotopes was the precipitation-evaporation balance and the contribution of upwelling waters, respectively. Further south, in close proximity to the sea ice and on the Antarctic shelf, water isotope values were more variable and predominantly influenced by the melting/freezing of sea-ice coupled to inputs from glacial/snow melt water. Local increases in \u03b413CDIC were likely due to photosynthetic enrichment of the DIC pool. Using this new instrumentation has provided one of the most comprehensive oceanic transect data sets yet achieved and illustrates the potential of these methods to delineate discrete water masses and advance our knowledge of both water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46616414/Continuous_shipboard_measurements_of_oce20160619-20845-e0gmgq.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ux34yxA-VNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
