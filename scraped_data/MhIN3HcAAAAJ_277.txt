The Mertz polynya is formed in East Antarctica by persistent katabatic winds and an ice barrier created by the Mertz Glacier Tongue. The region plays a significant role in the formation of dense shelf water (DSW) primarily due to salt rejection during intense sea-ice formation. Physical and biogeochemical observations indicate that primary production over the shelf in spring/summer preconditions the dense water outflows, supplying both organic material, and water depleted in CO2, to coral and sponge communities on the continental slope. The formation and export of DSW also plays a role in the transfer of anthropogenic CO2 to the deep ocean. In February 2010 a large piece of ice (~70 km long and ~35 km wide) calved from the Mertz Glacier Tongue, dramatically changing the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/96903/", "cites_per_year": {}}
