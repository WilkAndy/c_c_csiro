A standard instrument on these moorings is an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), which provides information on the direction and magnitude of ocean currents in the water column. These instruments use an integrated magnetic compass to alight current vector readings with compass points. Unfortunately, at high latitudes - such as those near the magnetic South Pole - those internal compasses are not able to produce a reliable heading. A system was needed to supplement the internal ADCP compass in order to properly align the current heading. A system using a fiber optic gyroscope was developed to provide corrected heading information for the instrument packages. This paper discusses the challenges of correcting for compass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6741100/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wxBSw0a7EawJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
