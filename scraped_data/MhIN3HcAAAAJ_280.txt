The international World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program collected a global high-quality baseline of full-depth, accurate oceanographic transects in the 1980s and 1990s. Since the 2000s, some of these transects are being reoccupied, again through international collaboration, as part of GO-SHIP (The Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Program). The average dates of the first and last data used to estimate these trends are circa 1991 and 2008. Temperature analyses reveal a nearly global-scale signature of warming in the abyssal ocean ventilated from the Antarctic. In the deep basins around Antarctica, AABW warmed at a rate of 0.02 to 0.05 C per decade below 4000 m. In addition, the waters between 1000 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.1640J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
