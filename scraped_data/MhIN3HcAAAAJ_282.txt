The Southern Ocean makes a substantial contribution to this oceanic sink: more than 40% of the global oceanic inventory of anthropogenic CO2 has entered the ocean south of 40S. The rate-limiting step in ocean sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 is the transfer of carbon across the base of the surface mixed layer into the ocean interior. However, the physical mechanisms responsible for the subduction of anthropogenic CO2 are poorly known. Here we use observations to show that the subduction occurs in specific locations where wind-driven Ekman transport, eddy fluxes and variations in mixed layer depth along mean streamlines drive anthropogenic carbon across the mixed-layer base. The net subduction is 0.42+/-0.2 Pg C/y between 35S and the marginal sea-ice zone.
