The cycles of these two elements differ because different players are controlling their water column distributions-biogenic Ba-barite being associated with undefined plankton detritus while the silicon distribution is mainly determined by diatoms. In the Southern Ocean the combination of an intermediate and a deep water re-circulation cell (Toggweiler et al., 2006) favors diatom predominance and an efficient retention of Si (Sarmiento et al., 2007). It is not known to what extent these conditions also control the distribution of Ba in the Southern Ocean. Here we investigate the variability of Si and Ba between the major Southern Ocean basins and along water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.vliz.be/en/maps-library?module=ref&refid=217411", "cites_per_year": {}}
