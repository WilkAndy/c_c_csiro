The Southern Ocean connects the ocean basins and links the shallow and deep limbs of the overturning circulation, a global-scale system of ocean currents that influences how much heat and carbon the ocean can store (Rintoul et al., 2001). The upwelling of deep waters returns carbon (e.g. le Quer\u00e9 et al., 2007) and nutrients (e.g. Sarmiento et al., 2004) to the surface ocean; the compensating sinking of surface waters into the ocean interior sequesters carbon and heat and renews oxygen levels. The capacity of the ocean to moderate the pace of climate change is controlled strongly by the circulation of the Southern Ocean. The future of the Antarctic ice sheet, and therefore sealevel rise, is increasingly understood to be determined by the rate at which the relatively warm ocean can melt floating glacial ice around the margin of Antarctica (Rignot and Jacobs, 2002). The expansion and contraction of Antarctic sea ice influences surface albedo, air-sea exchange of heat and of gases, such as carbon dioxide and oxygen, and the habitat for a variety of marine organisms (Thomas and Dieckmann, 2002). The Southern Ocean is also home to unique and productive ecosystems and rich biodiversity. Given the significance of the Southern Ocean to the Earth system, any change in the region would have impacts that extend well beyond the high southern latitudes. Recent studies suggest change is underway: the Southern Ocean is warming and freshening throughout most of the ocean depth (Gille, 2008 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://ecite.utas.edu.au/76088/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cZJPzge2pQ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
