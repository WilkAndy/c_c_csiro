Since the atmospheric CFC-12 concentrations increased during most of this 17-year interval while CFC-11 atmospheric concentrations peaked in the mid-1990s and were lower in 2008 than in 1991, we focus on pCFC-12. The pCFC-12 concentrations below the surface layer, in general, have increased along the section. However there have been large changes of pCFC-12 within the lower thermocline between the individual re-occupations. pCFC-12 changes of 30-120 ppt (15-50% of the measured pCFC-12) located over depth ranges of 100-500 m and 5 degrees of latitude can be identified between subsequent re-occupations. These changes appear to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFMOS53B1390W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
