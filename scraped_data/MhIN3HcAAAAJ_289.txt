The Austral summertime survey shows low oxygen, warm and relatively fresh modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) intruding southward across the shelf at the eastern edge of the Ad\u00e9lie Sill below the summer mixed layer. This MCDW intrusion extends southward along the eastern edge of the Ad\u00e9lie Depression and over the shelf, almost to the edge of the Mertz Glacier Tongue, deepening and becoming cooler and more saline as it does so. This overlies dense shelf water (SW) which fills the depression and is exported off-shelf through the western edge of the Ad\u00e9lie Sill, as well as Ice Shelf Water (ISW) which is largely found on the eastern slopes of the depression, below the maximum depth of the sill.
