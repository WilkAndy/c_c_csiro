The SAF was found to be an energetic, meandering jet with vertically coherent fluctuations varying on a timescale of 20 days with typical amplitude 30 cm s             \u22121             at 1150 dbar. A daily varying coordinate frame that follows the direction of flow allowed mesoscale variability of the SAF to be isolated from variability due to meandering of the front and proved very successful for examining eddy fluxes. Vertically averaged cross-stream eddy heat flux was 11.3 kW m             \u22122             poleward and significantly different from zero at 95% for fluctuations in the 2\u201390 day band.
