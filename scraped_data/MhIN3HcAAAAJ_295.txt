Australia (3) Department of Oceanography, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA Because of its unique geography, an annular ocean circumnavigating a continent sitting on the pole, the Southern Ocean has a profound influence on the global ocean circulation and the earth\u2019s climate. Indeed, ocean circulation transfers water properties between different ocean basins and between different regimes of climate regimes variability. This transport is essentially coupled to winds and convective overturning, which links the full ocean volume to climate change at long decade-to-century time-scales and short time scales.
