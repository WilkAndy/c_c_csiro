Argo data provide a new view of the Southern Ocean interior and allow for the first time to resolve the seasonal cycle of the upper ocean. This new dataset is used to revisit the role of the mean flow in subducting water masses in the vicinity of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. New eddy diffusivity estimates are also used to revise the main balances of the 2-d overturning cell, and it is found that horizontal buoyancy mixing plays an important role near the main fronts of the ACC. The new estimate of kappa allows us to also revisit the estimate of the eddy induced advection through the parameterization of Gent and McWilliam (1990). Eddy diffusivity in the Southern Ocean has been estimated from several approaches in order \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFMOS13B1178S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
