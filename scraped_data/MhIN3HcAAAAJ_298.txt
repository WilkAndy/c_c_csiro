Over 80 CTD stations were occupied on the shelf or adjacent slope in the region between 139 13'E and 145 E. In addition to hydrographic parameters, dissolved oxygen and nutrients, CFCs, dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity were measured at nearly all of these stations. Several features of the CFC distributions stand out in this formation region of Adelie Land Bottom Water (ALBW) and appear to be related to the bathymetry of the shelf. There are two depressions in this region, both deeper than 800 m-one on the western edge of the study region and the other adjacent to the Mertz Glacial Tongue \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFMOS12A..05W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
