Processes that act on local and regional scales, which are often mediated by the interaction of the flow with topography, are fundamental in shaping the large-scale, three-dimensional circulation of the Southern Ocean. Recent advances provide insight into the response of the Southern Ocean to future change and the implications for climate, the carbon cycle and sea-level rise."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6093095788196630528", "cites_id": ["6093095788196630528"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0182-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AJDjNVYGj1QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 38, "2020": 31, "2021": 36, "2022": 56, "2023": 26}}
