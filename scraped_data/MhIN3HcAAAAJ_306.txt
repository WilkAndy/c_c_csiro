We analyse the ocean's response to changes in surface forcing using two different methods and across ten models from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. We compare the 1950's 20th century mean climate and the 2090s A2 scenario, where CO2 concentration reaches 860 ppm by the year 2100. Subduction rates are analysed on density surfaces (which evolve with time) and on surfaces that are fixed in time, defined by the position of density surfaces in the 1950s. We diagnose the subduction and entrainment rates of mode and intermediate water masses on both surfaces. The model means show a decrease in the subduction rates resulting from warming and freshening at the ocean's surface in the South-east Indian and Pacific \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFMGC43A0951D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
