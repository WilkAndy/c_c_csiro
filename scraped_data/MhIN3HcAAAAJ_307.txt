The original plan was to carry out the transect from south to north, however following a stop at Macquarie Island the ship had to return to Tasmania for major CTD winch repairs. The transect was then commenced from north to south, skipping some stations due to bad weather. These stations were occupied on the return passage north."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/oceans/PACIFICA/09AR19910925/sr03_ado.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r3ej4c8HgjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
