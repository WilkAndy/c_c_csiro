The potential for new knowledge to be gained from future Antarctic science is substantial. Therefore, the international Antarctic community came together to \u2018scan the horizon\u2019 to identify the highest priority scientific questions that researchers should aspire to answer in the next two decades and beyond. Wide consultation was a fundamental principle for the development of a collective, international view of the most important future directions in Antarctic science. From the many possibilities, the horizon scan identified 80 key scientific questions through structured debate, discussion, revision and voting. Questions were clustered into seven topics: i) Antarctic atmosphere and global connections, ii) Southern Ocean and sea ice in a warming \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8749076183058616192", "cites_id": ["8749076183058616192"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/roadmap-for-antarctic-and-southern-ocean-science-for-the-next-two-decades-and-beyond/0AC6CADDCCD84DD4394015D13DB8F576", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gA8KFG_2ankJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 4, "2015": 12, "2016": 15, "2017": 30, "2018": 28, "2019": 28, "2020": 25, "2021": 25, "2022": 23, "2023": 9}}
