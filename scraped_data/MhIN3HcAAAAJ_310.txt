The CFCs were measured along this section previously in 1991 and 1995, providing an opportunity for determining the penetration of these transient tracers into the water column in this region of the Southern Ocean. The largest changes in CFC concentrations are in the Adelie Land Bottom Water and in the waters with neutral density less than 27.7. The CFC concentrations within Circumpolar Deep Waters are only slightly changed over the 10 years except adjacent to the Antarctic continental slope. When pCFC values are compared on isopycnal surfaces, the waters within the pycnocline between the Subantarctic Front and the southern expression of the Polar Front are less ventilated in 2001 than in previous occupations.
