We find SLH and SST anomalies in the ACW overlying one another (figure 1), acting to constrain the oceanic physics of the climate change phenomenon. The SLH anomalies derive from two components; pycnocline depth anomalies and diabatic heat storage in the layer above the main pycnocline, the former conserving vorticity and the latter conserving heat.
