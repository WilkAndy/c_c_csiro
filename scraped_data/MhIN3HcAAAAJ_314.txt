Three techniques have been used to estimate ocean heat flux: direct calculations using oceanographic observations, integration of surface fluxes determined using bulk formulae, and the residual method, where ocean fluxes are inferred from the difference between top-of-atmosphere energy fluxes and atmospheric transport estimates (see Bryden and Imawaki (2001) for a discussion). Until recently, estimates using different techniques have varied widely. Even \u201cdirect\u201d estimates using the same data and different assumptions have produced results which differ significantly (eg, at 30S in the Indian Ocean). In recent years, the various estimates have begun to converge and provide a more consistent view of the global ocean heat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:DrR-2ekChdkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://woceatlas.tamu.edu/orsi/ftp/inventory/transport_wkshop.pdf#page=29", "cites_per_year": {}}
