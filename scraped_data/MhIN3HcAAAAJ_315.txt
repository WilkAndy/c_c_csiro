In the Southern Ocean, climate variability is evident on time-scales of days to centuries. A dominant mode of variability is, however, interannual to decadal. In this talk I examine what controls the variability of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW), a water-mass formed on the equatorward side of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. South of Australia, observed SAMW temperature and salinity anomalies seem to occur in phase and are thus unlikely to be controlled by variations in air-sea heat/freshwater exchange. Experiments with a coupled climate model suggest the observations south of Australia are typical of the Subantarctic Zone. In particular, we find that SAMW TS variability is controlled by ocean transport changes, mainly variations in the equatorward Ekman transport of cool, fresh water across the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AGUSM..OS22A08E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
