For this reason, it is important to understand the response of pelagic biota to increased iron supply. Here we report the results of a mesoscale iron fertilization experiment in the polar Southern Ocean, where the potential to sequester iron-elevated algal carbon is probably greatest. Increased iron supply led to elevated phytoplankton biomass and rates of photosynthesis in surface waters, causing a large drawdown of carbon dioxide and macronutrients, and elevated dimethyl sulphide levels after 13 days. This drawdown was mostly due to the proliferation of diatom stocks. But downward export of biogenic carbon was not increased. Moreover, satellite observations of this massive bloom 30 days later \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=877158841263143223&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NzkVmVFLLAwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
