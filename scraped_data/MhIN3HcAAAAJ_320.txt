It is the coldest, densest water found in the deep ocean. This water is found in all of the deep basins around the Antarctic continent, broken only by the relatively shallow sill through Drake Passage. Estimates of the volume of AABW (defined by water denser than neutral density\u2014Jackett & McDougall 1997 [y\"> 28.27 kg. m-?]) show it to occupy 3.5% of the volume of the ocean (Orsi et al. 1999) and affect, through mixing and advection, more than 41% of the global oceanic volume (Worthington 1981). Estimates of the production rate of bottom water vary but range from 8\u201312 Sv (Orsi et al. 1999 (1 Sv= 10\u00ba m\u00ba. s-']), giving a renewal time (defined here as the volume occupied by AABW divided by production rate) of 180\u2013120 years, respectively. This renewal time is quite long, reflecting the fact that the production rate is small compared with the volume of the ocean occupied by AABW. Yet it is this production rate combined with the relatively low mixing rates which creates the strong density gradients that define the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The main formation of AABW is thought to occur in three distinct regions, on the continental shelves of the western Weddell Sea, western Ross Sea and Ad\u00e9lie Land, south of Tasmania. The Ad\u00e9lie Land source of bottom water has always been considered to be negligible (Carmack 1977) compared with the Weddell and Ross Sea sources."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10277684243245646679&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:V0NJoF2roY4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
