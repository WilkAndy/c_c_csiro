The input rate of CO2 to the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning and deforestation has continued to increase over the last century. To balance the global carbon budget, a sink is required whose magnitude is changing on similar time scales. We have sought to identify aspects of the ocean system that are capable of responding on decadal time scales, to examine our present ability to model such changes, and to pinpoint ways in which this ability could be improved. Many other important aspects of the ocean's role in global change are not addressed, including the importance of oceanic heat transport and thermal inertia to the climate system, biogeochemical cycling of elements other than carbon, and the importance of the ocean as a source or sink of trace gases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19940026118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HA09zPBqlFgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
