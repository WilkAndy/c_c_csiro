In the first scenario, greenhouse gas emissions remained unchecked, the climate continued to warm, and the policy response was ineffective; this had large ramifications in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, with worldwide impacts. In the second scenario, ambitious action was taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to establish policies that reduced anthropogenic pressure on the environment, slowing the rate of change in Antarctica. Choices made in the next decade will determine what trajectory is realized."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14956530394031010141,1008843282802650260", "cites_id": ["14956530394031010141", "1008843282802650260"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0173-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XTGNeCZFkM8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 7, "2019": 35, "2020": 54, "2021": 35, "2022": 44, "2023": 15}}
