Persistent wind-driven sea ice export 66 and winter heat loss in coastal polynyas results in continuous sea ice formation and brine 67 rejection. In some polynyas, the buoyancy loss due to cooling and salinification is sufficient 68 to drive deep convection and formation of Dense Shelf Water (DSW). 69The cold and salty DSW that cascades down the Antarctic continental slope is the 70 precursor of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), the densest water mass in the ocean. The 71 down-slope transport of DSW and AABW formation play a crucial role in Earth\u2019s climate 72 system, global deep-ocean circulation (Orsi et al., 1999; Jacobs, 2004), and biogeochemical 73 cycles (Shapiro et al., 2003). They connect the surface waters, imprinted with the signal of 74 exchange with the atmosphere, with the deep ocean and transport dense water and tracers 75"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Esther-Portela-2/publication/360561651_Controls_on_Dense_Shelf_Water_formation_in_four_East_Antarctic_polynyas/links/627e236fb1ad9f66c8baca20/Controls-on-Dense-Shelf-Water-formation-in-four-East-Antarctic-polynyas.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RXWEMBP4kNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
