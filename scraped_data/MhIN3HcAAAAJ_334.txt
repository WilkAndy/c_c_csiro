We found that the distribution of maxima in\u2207 SSH was sharply peaked at particular values of SSH, demonstrating that each frontal jet was associated with a narrow range of SSH values over the 12 year period. Ten SSH contours are sufficient to account for 92% of all enhanced\u2207 SSH values (Figure 2)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/fileadmin/documents/OSTST/2007/sokolov.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KNk9Z47rC2EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
