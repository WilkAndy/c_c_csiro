This global density driven circulation implies the existence of water mass inter-basin exchange, its precise magnitude yet to be determined. Most of the previous studies have focused on two primary pathways, the cold route through Drake Passage and the warm route following the Indonesian Throughflow and the Agulhas Current, and less has been said about a third route called the Tasman Leakage, its existence suggested by numerical models since 2001. In this study we use the velocity field at 1000 m depth, as inferred from Argo drifters, to confirm the existence of water transfer from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean through the Tasman Leakage. This transference appears to originate at the Eastern Australia Current (EAC), with an estimate of 4 Sv travelling from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean in the stratum comprised between 27.6 kg/m3 and 27.125 kg/m3, situated around 1000m depth, and closes a circulation pattern around the Southern Hemisphere that has been called the Southern Ocean Supergyre. Here we discuss the mean flow patterns as well as their seasonal variations. The EAC seasonal variation shows a different pattern at surface and in depth: while there is a strong seasonal variation at surface, with a larger southern current during the austral summer; the deep EAC is more persistent due to the water provided from deep zonal jets developed in New Caledonia, sustaining a deep current that turns around the southernmost tip of Tasmania \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miquel-Rosell-Fieschi-2/publication/297756920_Tasman_Leakage_and_EAC_from_Argo_drifters_A_confirmation_of_the_Southern_Ocean_Supergyre/links/56e2c23f08ae67e4bbe7cf92/Tasman-Leakage-and-EAC-from-Argo-drifters-A-confirmation-of-the-Southern-Ocean-Supergyre.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
