This paper reviews current and expected changes in ASO physical habitats in response to climate change. It then reviews how these changes may impact the autecology of marine biota of this polar region: microbes, zooplankton, salps, Antarctic krill, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and benthos. The general prognosis for ASO marine habitats is for an overall warming and freshening, strengthening of westerly winds, with a potential pole-ward movement of those winds and the frontal systems, and an increase in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17549252426408516906&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Kt29FRp4i_MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
