Since the IPCC report, nature continues to provide evidence that it is under duress with impacts affecting people and animals. Increasing rates of carbon dioxide emissions raise the specter that future climate changes could be much larger and come much quicker than IPCC suggests (eg, Raupach et al. 2007).The AR4 found that warming of the climate system is unequivocal based on an increasing body of evidence showing discernible physically consistent changes. These include increases in global average surface air temperature; atmospheric temperatures above the surface, surface and sub-surface ocean water temperature; widespread melting of snow; decreases in Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness; decreases in glacier and small ice cap extent and mass; and rising global mean sea level. The observed surface warming at global and continental scales is also consistent with reduced duration of freeze seasons; increased heat waves; increased atmospheric water vapor content and heavier precipitation events; changes in patterns of precipitation; increased drought; increases in intensity of hurricane activity, and changes in atmospheric winds. This wide variety of observations gives a very high degree of confidence to the overall findings. Because these changes are now simulated in climate models for the past 100 years to a reasonable degree, there is added confidence in future projections for more warming and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.oceanobs09.net/plenary/files/Trenberth_IPCC_PLENARY_Paper.doc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_BbTdsoGnO8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
