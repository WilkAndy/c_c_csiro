By considering a balance between frictional and Coriolis forces and assuming a constant vertical eddy viscosity, Ekman (1905) devised equations for the latitudinal and longitudinal velocity components as a function of depth. For steady winds the resulting solution is the Ekman spiral which has a characteristic exponential velocity amplitude decay and anticyclonic (anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) rotation with increasing depth. The net transport arising from Ekman currents is of significance in meridional overturning circulation, driving the upwelling of deep waters (Speer et al. 2000) and transporting them northward. It may also be significant in the formation of Mode Waters (Sall\u00e9e et al. 2006).Previous studies have established the validity of the relationship between wind stress and net Ekman transport and observed Ekman-like spirals in data averaged over long time periods in a coordinate frame relative to the wind. However, details of the vertical structure of net transport are still not fully resolved and the detection of Ekman"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/53098229/.7_OBSERVATIONS_OF_EKMAN_SPIRALS_AND_EKM20170512-17335-1jmauzp.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UTHLX8M9UGIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
