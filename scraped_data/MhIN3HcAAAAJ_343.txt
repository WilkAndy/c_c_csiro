Southern Ocean processes operate at a wide range of space and time scales to influence regional and global climate. The region is remote, and the environment is hostile. Historical data is scarce, and as a result hypotheses regarding the climate influence of Southern Ocean processes have been difficult to formulate and test. However, recent advances in both measuring and modelling the Southern Ocean are providing substantial insights into the region\u2019s impacts on climate. These new results provide the foundation for development of a feasible, cost-effective observing system for the Southern Ocean. The purpose of this article is to highlight a few recent advances of particular relevance to CLIVAR, and to demonstrate that the objectives of CLIVAR are unlikely to be met without sustained observations of the mid-and high-latitude \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15571895803739847601&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sTtP5bp8GtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
