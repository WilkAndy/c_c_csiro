A CTD transect up the northeastern flank of the Kerguelen Plateau, south across the Princess Elizabeth Trough and onward to the Antarctic continenl shelf was occupied on both cruises. Additional CTD stations were occupied around an experimental krill survey area in the vicinity of Mawson on the first cruise. A full occupation of CLIVAR meridional section I9S was completed on the second cruise. A total of 179 CTD vertical profile stations were taken over the two cruises, most to within 30 m of the bottom. Over 3500 Niskin bottle water samples were collected for the measurement of salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, CFC's, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, 18O, methane, selenium and biological parameters, using a 24 bottle rosette sampler. Full depth current profiles were collected by an LADCP attached to the CTD package, while near surface current data were collected by a ship mounted ADCP. An array of 8 moorings comprising current meters and thermosalinographs were deployed up the northeastern slope of the Kerguelen Plateau in February 2003 during the first cruise, and retrieved on the second cruise in January 2005. A summary of all data and data quality is presented in this report."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/ftp/oceans/CLIVAR/I09S_2004/i09s_09AR20041223do.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7d8UzoUF-oYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
