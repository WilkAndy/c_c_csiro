The cruise commenced with work around the former Mertz Glacier ice tongue, followed by a south to north occupation of the CLIVAR/WOCE meridional section I9S ( Figure 1). Five oceanographic moorings were recovered from the southern end of I9S. Some bottom imaging camera work was conducted during the Antarctic phase, as part of the ongoing CEAMARC biological program. This report discusses the oceanographic data from CTD operations on the cruise."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data/8878/09AR20120105_do.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FyxiKRdUwI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
