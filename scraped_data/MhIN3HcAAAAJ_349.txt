Vertical sections 5 and bottom layer water mass properties sampled during two RVIB Nathaniel 6 B Palmer hydrographic surveys (NBP00\u201308, Dec. 2000/Jan. 2001 and NBP04\u20137 08, Oct. 2004) describe the spreading of cold, dense shelf water on the con-8 tinental slope and rise from two independent source regions. The primary 9 source region is the Ad\u00e9lie Depression, exporting high salinity shelf water 10 through the Ad\u00e9lie Sill at 143\u25e6 E. An additional eastern source region of lower 11 salinity dense shelf water from the Mertz Depression is identified for the first 12 time from bottom layer properties north-west of the Mertz Sill and Mertz 13 Bank (146\u2013148\u25e6 E) that extend as far as the Buffon Channel (144.75\u25e6 E) in 14 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14493782357392612598&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9tw1QENCJMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
