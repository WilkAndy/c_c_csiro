The Southern Ocean makes a substantial contribution to this oceanic carbon sink: more than 40% of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ocean has entered south of 40\u00b0\u2009S. The rate-limiting step in the oceanic sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide is the transfer of carbon across the base of the surface mixed layer into the ocean interior, a process known as subduction. However, the physical mechanisms responsible for the subduction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide are poorly understood. Here we use observationally based estimates of subduction and anthropogenic carbon concentrations in the Southern Ocean to determine the mechanisms responsible for carbon sequestration. We estimate that net subduction amounts to 0.42\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009Pg\u2009C yr\u22121 between 35\u00b0\u2009S and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9147942347821867942", "cites_id": ["9147942347821867942"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1523", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:puOs8xgF9H4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 11, "2014": 10, "2015": 19, "2016": 25, "2017": 22, "2018": 19, "2019": 17, "2020": 16, "2021": 18, "2022": 18, "2023": 9}}
