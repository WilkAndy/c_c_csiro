This is a critical and under-observed region for physical processes determining global climate. SASSI will be coordinated by the International Antarctic Zone (iAnZone) programme, a SCOR-and SCAR-Affiliated organisation. iAnZone\u2019s goal is to advance our understanding of climate-relevant processes within that region of the Southern Ocean poleward of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We maintain close cooperation with the CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Region Panel. The iAnZone website http://www. ldeo. columbia. edu/res/fac/physocean/ianzone/provides further information. SASSI was initiated at a three-day iAnZone open workshop in August 2004. An Expression of Interest (EoI) was submitted to the International Polar Year (IPY) in December 2004. SASSI was chosen to lead a cluster of 10 EoIs in preparation of a full bid, which was submitted in June 2005. The other EoIs enhanced the original project by adding other disciplines and techniques. A workshop to further develop SASSI was held at the iAnZone biennial meeting on 9th October 2005 in Venice, just prior to the Ross Sea conference (http://www. ross-sea. org/)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/19316/1/Exchanges35_web.pdf#page=63", "cites_per_year": {}}
