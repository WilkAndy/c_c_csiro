The Southern Ocean connects the global ocean basins and regulates the meridional overturning circulation. The exposed Arctic Ocean will affect ocean and atmospheric circulation, moisture and heat fluxes. Therefore, both polar regions play a critical role in setting the rate and nature of global climate variability through their moderation of the earth\u2019s heat, freshwater and carbon budgets.Recent studies suggest that some of the strongest climate change signals are already underway in the high latitudes. The Southern Ocean is warming more rapidly than the global average (Gille 2008, Boning et al., 2008). Increased precipitation and ice melt is linked to widespread freshening of the upper and deep layers of the Southern Ocean (Aoki et al., 2005, Rintoul 2007). Small increases in sea ice extent in the Ross Sea are partially offset by large decreases near the Antarctic Peninsula (Meredith and King, 2005, Stammerjohn et al., 2008). In the Arctic, widespread warming and changes in water mass properties and convection are observed (Polyakov et al., 2005, Yashayaev et al. 2008). The rapid loss in Arctic summer sea ice extent as demonstrated by the recent extreme 2007 sea ice minimum (Turner and Overland, 2009) is projected to increase the seasonal ice zone and albedo under future climate scenarios (Lee et al., 2009). Routine, sustained observations are required in order to detect, interpret and understand global climate change (Rintoul et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2009)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.oceanobs09.net/proceedings/ac/FCXNL-09A02-1765626-1-New_Summary_Doc.doc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DltRU_Fp-bsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
