Blue and green circles denote CTD stations during the recovery cruise in 2005 and the WOCE I8S in 1994-1995, respectively.Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) affects the global climate since it drives the global thermohaline circulation. The region off Adelie Land (around 145oE) located at the eastern edge of the Australian Antarctic Basin is considered to be an important source of AABW in addition to the Weddell and Ross Seas (Rintoul, 1998). Over the eastern flank of the Kerguelen Plateau (65-85oE) located at the western edge of this basin (Figure 1), there is a deep western boundary current (DWBC), which is a part of the basin-scale cyclonic circulation. Since this DWBC plays an important role in transporting AABW originating from the region off the Adelie Land toward the north, there have been several studies to estimate its volume transport (Speer and Forbes, 1994; Donohue et al., 1999; Aoki et al., 2008). However, these studies are based on snapshot measurement by CTD and ADCP and temporal variability of the transport has not been well understood."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2f3ad992aedaddecd33dd9cfa5e20eb1a9fba88d", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oT8roaBtLT4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
