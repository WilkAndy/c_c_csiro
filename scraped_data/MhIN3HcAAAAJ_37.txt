This region of the southern Antarctic Zone (AZ-S), between the southern branch of the Polar Front (PF) and the southern front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SAACF), is characterized by weak currents and is remote from the influence of sea-ice or coastal waters. The SOIREE site exhibits high nutrient concentrations year-round (phosphate, nitrate and silicate remain above 10\u03bcM), low chlorophyll accumulations (<0.5\u03bcg/l), and moderate summer mixed-layer depths (50\u201370m). The SOIREE iron fertilization led to a large increase in algal biomass, particularly large diatoms, and persisted into March well after normal seasonal production is complete. No increase in carbon export occurred during the SOIREE 13-day observation period.
