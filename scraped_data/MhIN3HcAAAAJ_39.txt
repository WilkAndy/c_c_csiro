Here we synthesize the results of nine voyages over 8 years to describe the seasonal variation in mixed layer properties in the SAZ south of Australia for comparison with biogeochemical process studies carried out in late summer (March 1998) as part of the SAZ Project. Winter mixing extends to depths >400 m, resulting in the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water. In summer the mixed layer shoals to 75\u2013100 m, depths which are still sufficiently deep that phytoplankton growth may be light limited. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations are reduced in summer (e.g., nitrate decreases from >15 to <5 \u03bcmol kg\u22121) but remain well above limiting levels. Silicate, in contrast, is low throughout the year (4 \u03bcmol kg\u22121 in winter and <2 \u03bcmol kg\u22121 in summer).
