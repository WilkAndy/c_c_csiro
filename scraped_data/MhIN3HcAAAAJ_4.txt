A continuation of this intensification trend is projected by climate scenarios for the twenty-first century. The response of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the carbon sink in the Southern Ocean to changes in wind stress and surface buoyancy fluxes is under debate. Here we analyse the Argo network of profiling floats and historical oceanographic data to detect coherent hemispheric-scale warming and freshening trends that extend to depths of more than 1,000\u2009m. The warming and freshening is partly related to changes in the properties of the water masses that make up the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which are consistent with the anthropogenic changes in heat and freshwater fluxes suggested by climate models. However, we detect no \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 649, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3051671836145056892", "cites_id": ["3051671836145056892"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo362", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fHx91F23WSoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 28, "2010": 55, "2011": 59, "2012": 56, "2013": 64, "2014": 58, "2015": 50, "2016": 43, "2017": 47, "2018": 51, "2019": 19, "2020": 25, "2021": 39, "2022": 27, "2023": 15}}
