Nutrients carry significant information independent of temperature and salinity, with silicate being particularly useful. Accurate estimates of nutrient fluxes are found to require very detailed estimates of the circulation. The zonally integrated meridional cell carries a poleward heat flux of 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 1015 W and an equatorward oxygen flux of 2900 \u00b0 180 kmol s-1 across both latitudes. The net flux of silicate is 138 \u00b0 38 kmol s-1 and 152 \u00b0 56 kmol s-1 equatorward at 36\u00b0 and 24\u00b0N, respectively, and is sensitive to the details of the horizontal circulation as well as the strength of the overturning cell. The nitrate flux is 119 \u00b0 35 kmol s-1 to the north across 36\u00b0N and is indistinguishable from zero at 24\u00b0N, leading to a net divergence of nitrate between these two latitudes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1927608544898108649", "cites_id": ["1927608544898108649"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198014912800173", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6cyoOMI9wBoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 5, "1992": 2, "1993": 5, "1994": 6, "1995": 10, "1996": 8, "1997": 7, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 6, "2001": 10, "2002": 5, "2003": 14, "2004": 9, "2005": 7, "2006": 9, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
