The Totten Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, which buttresses a marine-based ice sheet with a volume equivalent to at least 3.5 m of global sea-level rise, also experiences rapid basal melt, but the role of ocean forcing was not known because of a lack of observations near the ice shelf. Observations from the Totten calving front confirm that (0.22 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 106 m3 s\u22121 of warm water enters the cavity through a newly discovered deep channel. The ocean heat transport into the cavity is sufficient to support the large basal melt rates inferred from glaciological observations. Change in ocean heat flux is a plausible physical mechanism to explain past and projected changes in this sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea level."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15419702495698831103", "cites_id": ["15419702495698831103"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.1601610", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_0ZVBrnJ_dUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 14, "2018": 27, "2019": 23, "2020": 23, "2021": 22, "2022": 21, "2023": 13}}
