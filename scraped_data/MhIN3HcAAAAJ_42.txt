We present time series (April 1998 to May 1999 and August 1999 to February 2000) of data from temperature\u2010salinity sensors, in both the Ad\u00e9lie Depression and the known outflow region of the Ad\u00e9lie Sill, to describe the annual cycle of shelf water densities. From April through September, salinification beneath the polynya produces dense shelf waters. During September\u2013October, shelf water densities in the depression peak at 27.94 kg m\u22123, and the cooling and freshening signature of Ice Shelf Water is observed north of Buchanan Bay. In November\u2013December, shelf water densities decrease as intrusions of warm and relatively fresh modified Circumpolar Deep Water enter east of the Ad\u00e9lie Sill. From January\u2013March the surface layer is conditioned by the cooling of the atmosphere, which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 148, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13694912833220785650", "cites_id": ["13694912833220785650"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007JC004346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8jUQvqkaDr4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 11, "2011": 10, "2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 10, "2017": 15, "2018": 12, "2019": 10, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 10}}
