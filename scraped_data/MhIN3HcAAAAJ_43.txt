The section was occupied in winter 1993 as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE, Section P11S). The primary objective of P11 was to quantify the zonal flows entering and leaving the western boundary of the basin. The primary inflow to the Tasman and Coral seas is supplied by the South Equatorial Current (SEC), which crosses the P11 section as a wide band of westward flow between 14 and 18S with a total geostrophic transport of 55 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3/s) relative to the bottom. The SEC bifurcates at the Australian coast near 18S: 29 Sv turns south to feed the East Australian Current (EAC), and 26 Sv recirculates in the Gulf of Papua New Guinea as a low-latitude \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7364221886788851967", "cites_id": ["7364221886788851967"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jmr/jmr/2000/00000058/00000002/art00003", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_9g06cn4MmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 8, "2008": 8, "2009": 3, "2010": 6, "2011": 13, "2012": 8, "2013": 16, "2014": 13, "2015": 3, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
