Water on the 28.35 kg\u00b7m\u22123 neutral density surface cooled by 0.2\u00b0C and freshened by 0.03 psu between 1994 and 2002. By re\u2010occupying the same stations in the same season, the effects of seasonal variability and spatial variability were minimised allowing the signal of water mass changes to be clearly identified. Comparison of the recent data to high quality historical observations shows that the ALBW also freshened between the late 1960s and the mid\u20101990s. Although there is insufficient data to construct a continuous time series, the simplest explanation of the observed changes is that there has been a long\u2010term (>30 year) and continuing freshening of the source waters supplying bottom water to the Australian \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13790703525163015822", "cites_id": ["13790703525163015822"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005GL024246", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jp4RNMprYr8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 6, "2009": 10, "2010": 9, "2011": 15, "2012": 9, "2013": 18, "2014": 10, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
