Vertical sections and bottom layer water mass properties sampled during two RVIB Nathaniel B Palmer hydrographic surveys (NBP00\u201308, December 2000/January 2001 and NBP04\u201308, October 2004) describe the spreading of cold, dense shelf water on the continental slope and rise from two independent source regions. The primary source region is the Ad\u00e9lie Depression, exporting high\u2010salinity dense shelf water through the Ad\u00e9lie Sill at 143\u00b0E. An additional eastern source region of lower\u2010salinity dense shelf water from the Mertz Depression is identified for the first time from bottom layer properties northwest of the Mertz Sill and Mertz Bank (146\u00b0E\u2013148\u00b0E) that extend as far as the Buffon Channel (144.75\u00b0E) in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8924856738785038254", "cites_id": ["8924856738785038254"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009JC005812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ro-IAut123sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 9, "2015": 7, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 4, "2020": 13, "2021": 9, "2022": 14, "2023": 9}}
