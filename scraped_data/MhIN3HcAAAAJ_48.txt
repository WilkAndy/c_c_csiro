Polynya activity thus both limits the ocean heat flux to the Antarctic Ice Sheet and promotes formation of Dense Shelf Water (DSW), the precursor to Antarctic Bottom Water. However, despite the presence of strong polynyas, DSW is not formed on the Sabrina Coast in East Antarctica and in the Amundsen Sea in West Antarctica. Using a simple ocean model driven by observed forcing, we show that freshwater input from basal melt of ice shelves partially offsets the salt flux by sea ice formation in polynyas found in both regions, preventing full-depth convection and formation of DSW. In the absence of deep convection, warm water that reaches the continental shelf in the bottom layer does not lose much heat to the atmosphere and is thus available to drive the rapid basal melt \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6361926279951683028", "cites_id": ["6361926279951683028"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.aap9467", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1A2-oz4aSlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 17, "2020": 29, "2021": 26, "2022": 34, "2023": 12}}
