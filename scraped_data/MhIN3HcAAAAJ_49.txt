The volume of AABW with neutral density (\u03b3n)\u2009>\u200928.30\u2009kg\u2009m\u22123 decreased by \u226550% between 1969\u20131971 and 2008\u20132012, thinning at a rate of >100\u2009m per decade. Contraction of dense AABW was balanced primarily by expansion of water lighter than \u03b3n\u2009=\u200928.15\u2009kg\u2009m\u22123 prior to 1995 and by inflation of less dense classes of AABW after 1995. Oxygen concentrations remained unchanged in the densest AABW and increased on neutral surfaces for AABW with \u03b3n\u2009>\u200928.31\u2009kg\u2009m\u22123, between 1995 and 2011\u20132012, consistent with continued ventilation over this time period. The observed changes in potential temperature, salinity, density, volume, and oxygen of AABW can be accounted for by freshening of the source waters but cannot \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6092016383234936250", "cites_id": ["6092016383234936250"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013GL058921", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ug2UqJ8wi1QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 16, "2017": 10, "2018": 17, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 18, "2022": 13, "2023": 13}}
