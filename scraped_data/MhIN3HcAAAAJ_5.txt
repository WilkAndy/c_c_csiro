It illustrates the recent observations of the structure and transport of the ACC. Numerical and analytical models have led to substantial advances with regard to the theory and dynamics of the ACC, and its links to the meridional circulation. Also, new observations and analysis techniques have allowed the circulation, formation, and modification of Southern Ocean water masses to be quantified for the first time. The chapter also presents the observations, which have led to new insights into the meridional circulation of the southern ocean and its link to the global overturning circulation. The momentum, vorticity and buoyancy budgets\u2013and as a consequence, the zonal and meridional circulations\u2013are intimately linked. The dynamics of the ACC differ in character from those of strong currents in other ocean basins that are zonally \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 585, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7666959139091698693", "cites_id": ["7666959139091698693"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0074614201801248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BdT-OLeCZmoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 5, "2001": 6, "2002": 20, "2003": 16, "2004": 16, "2005": 17, "2006": 25, "2007": 33, "2008": 25, "2009": 15, "2010": 27, "2011": 35, "2012": 44, "2013": 33, "2014": 43, "2015": 25, "2016": 38, "2017": 27, "2018": 26, "2019": 30, "2020": 23, "2021": 26, "2022": 17, "2023": 8}}
