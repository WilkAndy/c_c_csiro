A 62 year record on the Tasmanian continental shelf shows decadal variations of temperature and salinity, as well as a long\u2010term trend, which has been related to wind\u2010driven variations in the poleward extension of the EAC. Repeat expendable bathythermograph lines spanning the last 15 years suggest that low\u2010frequency variations in the transport of the EAC extension and Tasman Front are anticorrelated, but the time series are too short to draw firm conclusions. Here we use two ocean state estimates spanning the past 50 years to diagnose the physical mechanisms and spatial structure of the decadal variability of the South Pacific subtropical gyre. The observations and state estimates paint a consistent picture of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8148159823099055138", "cites_id": ["8148159823099055138"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009jc005926", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IsztNDAUFHEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 5, "2013": 13, "2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 12, "2018": 7, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
