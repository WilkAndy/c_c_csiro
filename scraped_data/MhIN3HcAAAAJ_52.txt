This region lies in a zone of weak northward flow, between two branches of the Polar Front (hence the Interpolar Frontal Zone (IPFZ)). In the IPFZ, mixed layer nitrate concentrations are high (>24 \u03bcM) year\u2010round, while mixed layer silicic acid is intermediate (about 15 \u03bcM) in winter but is depleted to 2 \u03bcM or less in late summer. Dissolved Fe concentrations, only available for summer, are low (<0.2 nM). Mixed layer chlorophyll concentrations are generally <0.3 \u03bcg L\u22121 and surface waters thus fit the high\u2010nitrate low\u2010chlorophyll (HNLC) definition. In spring and early summer, the SCM is relatively shallow (about 60 m), intense (up to 1.5 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6213220542611862369", "cites_id": ["6213220542611862369"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000JC000322", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YTOKGSrLOVYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 7, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 11, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 5, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
