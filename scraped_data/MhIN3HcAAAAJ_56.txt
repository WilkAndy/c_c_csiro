Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the SAR11 and SAR116 clades and the cyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were strongly overrepresented north of the Polar Front (PF). Conversely, OTUs of the Gammaproteobacterial Sulfur Oxidizer\u2010EOSA\u20101 (GSO\u2010EOSA\u20101) complex, the phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia and order Rhodobacterales were characteristic of waters south of the PF. Functions enriched south of the PF included a range of transporters, sulfur reduction and histidine degradation to glutamate, while branched\u2010chain amino acid transport, nucleic acid biosynthesis and methionine \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16892133042649236041", "cites_id": ["16892133042649236041"], "pub_url": "https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.12035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SQK_AYHpbOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 13, "2022": 8, "2023": 6}}
