This cooling appears to reflect shoaling of isotherms along the continental shelf, that can be related statistically, observationally and by modeling to increasing coastal sea\u2010surface temperatures, that in turn reflect a poleward extension of the SW Pacific boundary current (the East Australian Current). The oceanographic changes implied by the coral record suggest climate change in temperate Australia starting about the time of European settlement. Correlations between temperate Australian and Antarctic indices suggest these long\u2010term changes might also be relevant to Antarctic climate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6666940229795939716", "cites_id": ["6666940229795939716"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003GL018869", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hIW_59C6hVwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 2, "2009": 13, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
