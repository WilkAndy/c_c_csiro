The diapycnal fluxes are found to be significant terms in the isopycnal budgets of mass, heat, and salt. Dense water entering the subtropical Indian and Pacific basins from the south is returned below the thermocline as less dense deep water. In the Southern Ocean deep water is converted to denser deep and bottom water. Water properties at intermediate depth are substantially modified by diapycnal fluxes of heat and salt, but the modification of intermediate water is not solely driven by interior mixing. The inferred fluxes help explain the changes in temperature\u2013salinity curves observed across each basin, and they are consistent with our understanding of the overall three-dimensional circulation of the Southern Ocean.The fact that area-averaged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7007766723107468492", "cites_id": ["7007766723107468492"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/30/9/1520-0485_2000_030_2320_eoaadf_2.0.co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zLSft7SWQGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 11, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 7, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
