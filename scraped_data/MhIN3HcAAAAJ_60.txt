Optimal interpolation of historical hydrography, including Argo floats, is used to produce GEM projections of the circumpolar temperature and salinity fields. Parameterizing these fields by dynamic height allows the use of altimetric SSH values from 1992\u20132006 to create synoptic temperature and salinity fields at weekly intervals on a \u2153 grid at 36 depth levels. The satellite-derived temperature and salinity fields generally capture over 90% of the property variance below the thermocline, with RMS residuals of 1.16 C and 0.132 in salinity at the surface, decreasing to less than 0.45 C and 0.05 below 500 dbar.
