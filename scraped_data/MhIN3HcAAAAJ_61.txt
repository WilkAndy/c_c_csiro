This focus was motivated by glaciological and oceanographic observations that showed ocean warming was driving loss of ice mass from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Paleoclimate studies confirmed that ice discharge from West Antarctica contributed several meters to sea level during past warm periods. On the other hand, the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) was generally considered to be relatively stable because of being largely grounded above sea level and therefore protected from ocean heat flux. However, recent studies suggest that a large part of the EAIS is grounded well below sea level and that the EAIS also retreated and contributed several meters to sea level rise during past warm periods. We use ocean observations from three ice shelf systems to illustrate the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1702415137138202961", "cites_id": ["1702415137138202961"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24862288", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UdleJYwxoBcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 15, "2022": 20, "2023": 6}}
