Here, the spatial distribution and export of SAMW is investigated using Argo profiles and a climatology. SAMW is identified by a dynamical tracer: a minimum in potential vorticity. We have found that SAMW consists of several modes with distinct properties in each oceanic basin. This conflicts with the previous view of SAMW as a continuous water mass that gradually cools and freshens to the east. The circulation paths of SAMW were determined using (modified) Montgomery streamlines on the density surfaces corresponding with potential vorticity minima. The distribution of the potential vorticity minima revealed \u201chotspots\u201d where the different SAMW modes subduct north of the Subantarctic Front. The subducted SAMWs follow \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1770211933703976995", "cites_id": ["1770211933703976995"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10236-010-0352-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IziV7V8OkRgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 12, "2020": 7, "2021": 13, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
