Based upon the geographical distribution pattern and ecology of biota with detectable vs. non-detectable PFC burdens, an evaluation of the potential contributory roles of alternative system input pathways is made. Our analytical findings, together with previous reports, reveal only the occasional occurrence of PFCs in migratory biota and vertebrate predators with foraging ranges extending into or north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Geographical contamination patterns observed correspond most strongly with those expected from delivery via hydrospheric transport as governed by the unique oceanographic features of the Southern Ocean. We suggest that hydrospheric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7849472743028869888", "cites_id": ["7849472743028869888"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749110002150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AMtYGt_t7mwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 8, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
