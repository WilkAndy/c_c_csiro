The GEM and satGEM projections allow the separation of observed trends into a component due to a shift of the circumpolar fronts (adiabatic) using the satGEM and a component due to changes in water masses (diabatic) expressed as a temporal trend in residual between historical hydrography and the static GEM. The mean southward movement of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) fronts drives an adiabatic warming of 1.196 \u00b1 0.090 W m\u22122 distributed over most of the ACC and at all depths. This is strongest where the meridional temperature gradient is largest, such as in the upper 1000 dbar of the Subantarctic Front (SAF). There is a weak adiabatic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5997393139925611819", "cites_id": ["5997393139925611819"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010JC006832", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:K3WhA0kFO1MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 8, "2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 11, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
