Previous ship-based observations documented distinct water properties and velocities associated with a deep western boundary current in the Kerguelen region,,,,,, but the mean flow is as yet unconstrained. Here we report measurements from a coherent array of eight current-meter moorings that reveal a narrow and intense equatorward flow extending throughout the water column just east of the Kerguelen plateau. Velocities averaged over two years exceed 20\u2009cm\u2009s\u22121 at depths of about 3,500\u2009m, the strongest mean deep western boundary current flow yet observed at similar depths. We estimate the mean equatorward transport of water colder than 0\u2009\u2218C at 12.3\u00b11.2\u00d7106\u2009m3\u2009s\u22121, partially compensated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14772336523110079055", "cites_id": ["14772336523110079055"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo842", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T1qB8szhAc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 10, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
