As a result, the Southern Ocean strongly influences climate patterns and the cycling of carbon and nutrients. Changes in the Southern Ocean therefore have global ramifications. Limited observations suggest the Southern Ocean is indeed changing: the region is warming more rapidly than the global ocean average; salinity changes driven by changes in precipitation and ice melt have been observed in both the upper and abyssal ocean; the uptake of carbon by the Southern Ocean has slowed the rate of atmospheric climate change but caused basin-wide ocean acidification; and Southern Ocean ecosystems are reacting to changes in the physical and chemical environment. However, the short and incomplete nature of existing time series makes the causes and consequences of observed changes difficult to assess. Sustained, multi-disciplinary observations are required to detect, interpret and respond to change. The Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) is needed to address six overarching scientific challenges: 1. The role of the Southern Ocean in the planet\u2019s heat and freshwater balance 2. The stability of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation 3. The role of the ocean in the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet and its contribution to sea-level rise 4. The future and consequences of Southern Ocean carbon uptake 5. The future of Antarctic sea ice 6. The impacts of global change on Southern Ocean ecosystems There is an urgent need to increase understanding in each of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8933390686435207970", "cites_id": ["8933390686435207970"], "pub_url": "https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00651/76345/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IuvAiH_H-XsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 10, "2013": 5, "2014": 14, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 6}}
