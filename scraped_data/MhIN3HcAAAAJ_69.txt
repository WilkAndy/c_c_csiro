These Southern Ocean upper-limb water masses ventilate the ocean interior, and changes in their properties have been related to climate change in numerous studies. Over time, the authors follow the low potential vorticity and salinity minimum layers describing SAMW and AAIW and find that the water column in the 2090s shifts to lighter densities by approximately 0.2 kg m             \u22123             . The model projects a reduction in the SAMW and AAIW annual mean subduction rates as a result of a combination of a shallower mixed layer, increased potential vorticity at the base of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7421711716643658221", "cites_id": ["7421711716643658221"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/22/12/2008jcli2653.1.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7Vnm_3s3_2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 7, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 12, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
