Cross validation shows this relationship can be used to infer baroclinic transport (above and relative to 2500 dbar) from temperature measurements with an error of a few per cent. The mean transport distribution derived from 31 austral summer expendable bathythermograph (XBT) sections over a 6 year period consists of westward flow immediately south of Tasmania, a broad band of strong eastward flow between 50\u00b0 and 55\u00b0S, and three cores of eastward flow south of 55\u00b0S. By defining a second empirical relationship between surface dynamic height and cumulative transport a continuous time series of baroclinic transport is derived from altimeter measurements of sea surface height.
