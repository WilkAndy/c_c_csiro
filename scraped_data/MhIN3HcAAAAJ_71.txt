Here we detail the interaction of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) with the Amery Ice Shelf, the largest ice shelf in East Antarctica, and provide the first estimates of basal melting due to mCDW. We use subice shelf ocean observations from a borehole site (AM02) situated \u223c70 km inshore of the ice shelf front, together with open ocean observations in Prydz Bay. We find that mCDW transport into the cavity is about 0.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 Sv (1 Sv\u2009=\u2009106 m3 s\u22121). The inflow of mCDW drives a net basal melt rate of up to 2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 m yr\u22121 during 2001 (23.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.52 Gt yr\u22121 from under about 12,800 km2 of the north\u2010eastern flank of the ice shelf). The heat content flux by mCDW at AM02 shows high intra\u2010annual variability (up to 40%). Our results suggest two main modes of subice \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16645406560626185856", "cites_id": ["16645406560626185856"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015JC010697", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:gJYUZBNdAOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
