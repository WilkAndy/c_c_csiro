In contrast, waters on the continental shelf in East Antarctica are cooler and ice shelves experience relatively low rates of basal melt. An exception is provided by the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves on the Sabrina Coast, where satellite\u2010derived basal melt rates are comparable to West Antarctica. Recent oceanographic observations have revealed that relatively warm (\u223c\u22120.4\u00b0C) modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) enters the cavity beneath the Totten Ice Shelf through a 1100 m deep trough, delivering sufficient heat to drive rapid basal melt. Here we use observations from a recent summer survey to show that mCDW is widespread on the continental shelf of the Sabrina Coast, forming a warm (up to 0.3\u00b0C) and saline (34.5\u201334.6) bottom layer overlaid by cold \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12912170925713733264", "cites_id": ["12912170925713733264"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2016jc012115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kDZLmgs_MbMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 6, "2020": 15, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 10}}
