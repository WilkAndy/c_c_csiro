After formation, the different AABW varieties cross the Southern Ocean and flow into the subtropical abyssal basins. It is shown here, using the analysis of Lagrangian trajectories within the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) model, that the pathways of the different sources of AABW have to a large extent amalgamated into one pathway by the time it reaches 31\u00b0S in the deep subtropical basins. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current appears to play an important role in the amalgamation, as 70% of the AABW completes at least one circumpolar loop before reaching the subtropical basins. This amalgamation of AABW pathways suggests that on decadal to centennial time scales, changes to properties and formation rates in any of the AABW source regions will be conveyed to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3817717352529519982", "cites_id": ["3817717352529519982"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/grl.50483", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:buVderRB-zQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 6, "2015": 6, "2016": 8, "2017": 6, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
