Strong cooling and freshening are observed on isopycnal layers denser than \u03b3n = 28.30 kg m\u22123. Changes in the average salinity and potential temperature below this isopycnal correspond to a basin-wide warming of 1300 \u00b1 200 GW and freshening of 24 \u00b1 3 Gt year\u22121. Recent changes to dense shelf water in the source regions in the Ross Sea and George V Land can explain the freshening of AA-AABW but not its extensive warming. An alternative mechanism for this warming is a decrease in the supply of AABW from the Ross Sea (RSBW). Hydrographic profiles between the western Ross Sea and George V Land (171\u2013158\u00b0 E) were analyzed with a simple advective-diffusive model to assess the causes of the observed changes. The model suggests that the warming of RSBW observed between the 1970s and 2000s can be explained by a 21 \u00b1 23% reduction in RSBW transport and the enhancement of the vertical diffusion of heat resulting from a 30 \u00b1 7% weakening of the abyssal stratification. The documented freshening of Ross Sea dense shelf water leads to a reduction in both salinity and density stratification. Therefore the direct freshening of RSBW at its source also produces an indirect warming of the RSBW. A simple box model suggests that the changes in RSBW properties and volume transport (a decrease of 6.7% is assumed between the year 1995 and 2005) can explain 51 \u00b1 6% of the warming \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8650255379521495557", "cites_id": ["8650255379521495557"], "pub_url": "https://os.copernicus.org/articles/8/419/2012/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BWLKyG_hC3gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
