The existence of this oceanic channel has profound implications for the global ocean circulation and climate. The Drake Passage gap permits the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) to exist, a system of ocean currents which \ufb02ows from west to east along a roughly 25000-km-long path circling Antarctica. In terms of transport, the ACC is the largest current in the world ocean, carrying about 13778\u00c2106m3s\u00c01 through the Drake Passage. The wind-driven ocean circulation theories that explain much of the ocean current patterns observed at other latitudes do not apply in an unbounded channel and the unique dynamics of the ACC have long been a puzzle for oceanographers. The threedimensional circulation in the ACC belt is now understood to re\ufb02ect the interplay of wind and buoyancy exchange with the atmosphere, water mass modi\ufb01cation, eddy \ufb02uxes of heat and momentum, and strong interactions between the \ufb02ow and bathymetry. The strong eastward \ufb02ow of the ACC has several important implications for the global ocean circulation and its in\ufb02uence on regional and global climate. By transporting water between the major ocean basins, the ACC tends to smooth out differences in water properties between the basins. The interbasin connection allows a global-scale pattern of ocean currents to be established, known as the thermohaline circulation (see Ocean Circulation: Meridional Overturning Circulation), which transports heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide around the globe and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9491438735747095797", "cites_id": ["9491438735747095797"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FYSCUH235E8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA196&dq=info:9ZyWCz5duIMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=1TaeBIhDhk&sig=8IshShFCRl29F85dQh8SsRUVavQ", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9ZyWCz5duIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
