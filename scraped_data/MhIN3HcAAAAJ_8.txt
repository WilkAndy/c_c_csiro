The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) carries a surplus of intermediate water into the South Atlantic through Drake Passage, which is compensated by a surplus of deep and bottom water leaving the basin south of Africa. As a result, the ACC loses 0.25\u00b10.18\u00d7 1015 W of heat in crossing the Atlantic. At 32\u00b0S the meridional flux of heat is 0.25\u00b10.12\u00d71015 W equatorward, consistent in sign but smaller in magnitude than other recent estimates. Attempts to force the system to carry a larger heat flux across 32\u00b0S led to unreasonable circulations. The meridional heat flux is carried primarily by an overturning cell in which the export of 17\u00d7106 m3 s\u22121 of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is balanced by an equatorward return flow equally split \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 444, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12445159423942651629", "cites_id": ["12445159423942651629"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/90JC02422", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7e40DY8WtqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 3, "1992": 8, "1993": 10, "1994": 11, "1995": 17, "1996": 31, "1997": 13, "1998": 20, "1999": 24, "2000": 15, "2001": 31, "2002": 21, "2003": 28, "2004": 14, "2005": 18, "2006": 6, "2007": 17, "2008": 13, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 10, "2012": 11, "2013": 15, "2014": 11, "2015": 9, "2016": 6, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 13, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 7}}
