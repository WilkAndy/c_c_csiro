Altimetry allows us to follow the spatial\u2013temporal evolution of these cold, low sea level anomalies. Most of these cold-core rings are formed from unstable meanders of the SAF, and the interaction of the meanders with bathymetry appears to influence the eddy spawning. The interaction of a westward propagating cold-core eddy with an eastward propagating equatorward meander can also trigger a cold-core eddy spawning event. Hydrographic sections show that these eddies have cool, low-salinity cores reaching to at least 1500m depth. During summer, their surface temperature signal is eliminated only 2\u20133 weeks after spawning, however, their surface salinity signature is maintained for 2\u20133 months \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5058131009995841403", "cites_id": ["5058131009995841403"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063704001426", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:e58wvloXMkYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
