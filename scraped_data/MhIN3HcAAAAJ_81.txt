Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are intrinsic to the Earth system, and their evolution is intertwined with and influences the course of the Anthropocene. In turn, changes in the Antarctic affect and presage humanity's future. Growing understanding is countering popular beliefs that Antarctica is pristine, stable, isolated, and reliably frozen. An aspirational roadmap for Antarctic science has facilitated research since 2014. A renewed commitment to gathering further knowledge will quicken the pace of understanding of Earth systems and beyond. Progress is already evident, such as addressing uncertainties in the causes and pace of ice loss and global sea-level rise. However, much remains to be learned. As an iconic global \"commons,\" the rapidity of Antarctic change will provoke further political action. Antarctic research is more vital \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 55, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14861346471487980748", "cites_id": ["14861346471487980748"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(19)30020-X.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zMQLheAbPs4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 9, "2021": 24, "2022": 14, "2023": 6}}
