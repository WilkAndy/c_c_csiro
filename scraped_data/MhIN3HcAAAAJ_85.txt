The physical structure in the upper 500m included a warm core eddy in the north, a cold core feature at 46\u00b030\u2032S, and two major fronts, the Subtropical Convergence and the Subantarctic Front, between 49\u00b0S and 50\u00b030\u2032S. In the region between the warm core eddy and the southern fronts, Subantarctic Mode Water was capped by a high salinity layer with a subsurface salinity maximum. Surface nitrate increased from zero in the north to more than 15\u03bcM in the south in a series of steps across surface fronts associated with mesoscale features. Phytoplankton column biomass, estimated column production (based on P vs I incubations) and estimated mixed layer growth rates were moderate throughout the transect (typically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6550946683281883628", "cites_id": ["6550946683281883628"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063798000351", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7EGKz0yj6VoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
