To identify the main features of the regional circulation and the physical drivers of the east/west contrast, we used World Ocean Circulation Experiment hydrographic sections SR3 and P11S (west and east of Tasmania, respectively), Argo float profiles and trajectories, and high resolution climatology. The East Australian Current and the Tasman Outflow are the mechanisms driving the variability in the eastern Subantarctic Zone. This region has a weak flow and an enhanced input of subtropical waters through eddies, interleaving and a subsurface salinity maximum intruding from the north to south. In the western Subantarctic Zone, the regional circulation is dominated by a northwestward circulation and a deep reaching anticyclonic recirculation. The South Tasman Rise acts as a barrier \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9901233521141977554", "cites_id": ["9901233521141977554"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064511001482", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0pHbsW0_aIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 9, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
