To gain statistical significance and accuracy in the resolution of the jets, more than 1,5 million particles are released every 6 months over 16 years and advected for one year. Results are analyzed in a dynamic height coordinate system. Cross-stream eddy diffusion is highly inhomogenous. Diffusivity is larger on the equatorward flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) along eddy stagnation bands, where eddy displacement speed approaches zero. Along such bands, diffusivities reach typical values of 3500 m2 s\u20131. Local maxima of about 8\u201312.103 m2 s\u20131 occur in the energetic western boundary current systems. In contrast, diffusivity is lower in the core of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with values of 1500\u20133000 m2 s\u20131, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5506528830366642238", "cites_id": ["5506528830366642238"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jmr/jmr/2011/00000069/f0030004/art00014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PnBz38sea0wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 9, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 7}}
