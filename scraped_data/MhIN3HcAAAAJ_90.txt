Significant freshening trends are detected within most of the water masses from the bottom to surface. Bottom Water freshened by 0.008\u20130.009 decade\u22121 below isopycnal surfaces and its layer thickness decreased by 120\u2013160 dbar decade\u22121 throughout the study period. In addition to general thinning, the layer thickness was anomalously thin in 2012, suggesting a possible link with the sudden calving of the Mertz Glacier Tongue and subsequent reduction in sea\u2010ice production. Winter Water freshened by 0.03 decade\u22121 throughout the study period, with significant interannual variability. In the offshore region, a long\u2010term increase in precipitation can explain a substantial portion of the freshening trend.
