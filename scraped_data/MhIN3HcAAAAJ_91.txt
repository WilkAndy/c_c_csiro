There is good correspondence between Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) front locations derived from temperatures sampled in the upper 150m along the penguin tracks and front positions inferred using maps of sea surface height (SSH). Mesoscale features detected in the SSH maps from this eddy-rich region are also reproduced in the individual temperature sections based on dive data. The foraging strategy of Macquarie Island king penguins appears to be influenced strongly by oceanographic structure: almost all the penguin dives are confined to the region close to and between the northern and southern branches of the Polar Front. Surface chlorophyll distributions also reflect the influence of the ACC fronts, with the northern branch of the Polar Front marking a boundary \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11158979930320595886", "cites_id": ["11158979930320595886"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063706000100", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rut4sh-p3JoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
