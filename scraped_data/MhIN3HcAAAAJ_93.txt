Limited observations suggest the Southern Ocean is changing: the region is warming more rapidly than the global ocean average; salinity changes driven by changes in precipitation and ice melt have been observed in both the upper and abyssal ocean; the uptake of carbon by the Southern Ocean has slowed the rate of climate change but increased the acidity of the Southern Ocean; and there are indications of ecosystem changes. However, the short and incomplete nature of existing time series means that the causes and consequences of observed changes are difficult to assess. Sustained, multi-disciplinary observations are required to detect, interpret and respond to change. The Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) will provide the long-term measurements required to improve understanding of climate change and variability, biogeochemical cycles and the coupling between climate and marine ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9713810257203383625", "cites_id": ["9713810257203383625"], "pub_url": "http://www.oceanobs09.net/proceedings/cwp/Rintoul-OceanObs09.cwp.74.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SU0nhPZizoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 7, "2011": 2, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
