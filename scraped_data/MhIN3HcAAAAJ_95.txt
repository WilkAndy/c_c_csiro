To explore and quantify these contributions, the Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) organized the SAZ Project, a multidisciplinary, multiship investigation carried out south of Australia in the austral summer of 1997\u20131998. Here we present a brief overview of the SAZ Project and some of its major results, as detailed in the 16 papers that follow in this special section."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4114730665929339739", "cites_id": ["4114730665929339739"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2001JC001008", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:W_Mfab11GjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 9, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
