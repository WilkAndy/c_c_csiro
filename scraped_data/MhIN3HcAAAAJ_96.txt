The AZ, which extends from the Polar Front (PF) to the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF), is characterized by a 150m deep layer of cold Winter Water (WW) overlayed in summer by warmer, fresher water mass known as Antarctic Surface Water (AASW). South of Tasmania, two branches of the PF divide the AZ into northern and southern zones with distinct water properties and variability. In the northern AZ (between the northern and southern branches of the PF), the mixed layer depth (MLD) is fairly constant in latitude, being 150m deep in winter and around 40\u201360m in summer. In the southern AZ, the winter MLD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MhIN3HcAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15175148302569432628", "cites_id": ["15175148302569432628"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063704001499", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NOaF1Pr0mNIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
