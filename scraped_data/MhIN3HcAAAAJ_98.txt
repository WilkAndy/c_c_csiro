It regulates the exchange of water across the shelf break and provides a path for interbasin westward transport. Despite its significance, the ASC remains largely unobserved around most of the Antarctic continent. Here we present direct velocity observations from a 17 month current meter moored array deployed across the continental slope between the 1000 and the 4200 m isobaths, in the southeastern Indian Ocean near 113\u00b0E. The observed time\u2010mean flow consists of a surface\u2010intensified jet associated with the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) and a broader bottom\u2010intensified westward flow that extends out to approximately the 4000 m isobath and is strongest along the upper slope. The time\u2010mean transport of the ASC is \u221229.2 Sv.
