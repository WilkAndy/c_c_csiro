Until recently, fungi have generally been regarded as causing only unaesthetic spoilage of food, despite the fact that Claviceps purpurea was linked to human disease more than 200 years ago, and the acute toxicity of macrofungi has long been known. Japanese scientists recognised the toxic nature of yellow rice 100 years ago, but 70 years elapsed before its fungal cause was confirmed. Alimentary toxic aleukia killed many thousands of people in the USSR in 1944\u20131947; although fungal toxicity was suspected by 1950, the causal agent, T-2 toxin, was not clearly recognised for another 25 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 6152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17585437405052595469,13342180033110133110,12649679383106919553", "cites_id": ["17585437405052595469", "13342180033110133110", "12649679383106919553"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-92207-2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:De0G9CUGDPQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 22, "1997": 26, "1998": 25, "1999": 33, "2000": 57, "2001": 49, "2002": 69, "2003": 84, "2004": 99, "2005": 122, "2006": 156, "2007": 171, "2008": 181, "2009": 179, "2010": 198, "2011": 196, "2012": 291, "2013": 310, "2014": 355, "2015": 357, "2016": 357, "2017": 428, "2018": 376, "2019": 403, "2020": 394, "2021": 450, "2022": 373, "2023": 118}}
