The medium, designated DG18, was shown to be significantly better than Christensen malt salt agar when both media were tested with foodstuffs and with pure culture inocula. The need for a medium of reduced alpha omega for enumerating xerophilic fungi from low-moisture foods was demonstrated by comparing fungal counts obtained on both high-alpha omega and low-alpha omega media."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 475, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3902554098867721923", "cites_id": ["3902554098867721923"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.39.3.488-492.1980", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w1bBu0aoKDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 4, "1986": 7, "1987": 5, "1988": 4, "1989": 6, "1990": 6, "1991": 9, "1992": 21, "1993": 9, "1994": 18, "1995": 13, "1996": 11, "1997": 12, "1998": 6, "1999": 2, "2000": 12, "2001": 10, "2002": 13, "2003": 11, "2004": 10, "2005": 10, "2006": 16, "2007": 17, "2008": 18, "2009": 15, "2010": 16, "2011": 24, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 12, "2015": 8, "2016": 13, "2017": 25, "2018": 19, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
