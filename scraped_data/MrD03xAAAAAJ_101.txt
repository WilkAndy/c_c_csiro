The conservation of species names as accepted by the Aspergillus community is described. Published lists of accepted names provide that people who use Aspergillus and Penicillium taxonomies need no longer fear the overturning of names currently used. Aspergillus is a good example of a genus where the naming of both anamorph and teleomorph has been applied and arguments are given for maintaining the system of dual nomenclature. A protocol for describing new taxa in Aspergillus and their teleomorphs is proposed, including the availability of living ex type cultures, deposit of type cultures in at least two recognised culture collections, deposits of sequence data in specialised data bases and registration of the new names in MycoBank."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16362354535353268699", "cites_id": ["16362354535353268699"], "pub_url": "https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wfbi/sim/2007/00000059/00000001/art00011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:27m7KMLCEuMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
