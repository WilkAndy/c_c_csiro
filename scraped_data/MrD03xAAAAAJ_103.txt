Trees were generated from aligned sequence data of each rDNA region using parsimony methods. The tree topologies for each rDNA region, and for the combined data set, were identical in all statistically significant branches as assessed by bootstrap analysis. Both rDNA regions support the separation of the two meiotic genera with mitotic Penicillium states, Talaromyces and Eupenicillium, into two distinct evolutionary lineages within the Eurotiales. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two distinct phylogenetic origins account for the evolution of the synnematous Penicillium species examined.
