Several species in this Section are common in vineyards and are often associated with bunch rots (Amerine et al., 1980). A. niger is reported to be the primary cause of Aspergillus rot in grapes before harvest (Nair, 1985; Snowdon, 1990), while A. aculeatus (Jarvis and Traquair, 1984) and A. carbonarius (Gupta, 1956) have also been reported. The development of fungal bunch rots has been correlated with the splitting of grape berries (Barbetti, 1980), and Aspergillus counts on grapes grown for drying were greater during seasons when rain before harvest caused the berries to split (Figure 1)(Leong et al., 2004). Spores of black Aspergillus spp. are resistant to UV light (Rotem and Aust, 1991), which may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14929955774715035446", "cites_id": ["14929955774715035446"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-28391-9_9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Nn8uwKzbMc8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
