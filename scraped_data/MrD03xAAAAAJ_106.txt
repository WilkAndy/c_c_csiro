A new description and related taxonomic information are given, based on examination of a number offresh isolates from pome fruit and wooden fruit bin surfaces in Australia and from processed meats in Germany. Isolates of P. solitum were less virulent on apple and pear fruits than those of P. expansum, the dominant pathogenic Penicillium on pome fruits. P. solitum and P. expansum showed similar temperature growth curves, but growth of P. solitum was slower. All isolates of P. solitum from fruit and fruit storage bins in this study were insensitive to benomyl, but isolates from meat and cheese were sensitive to benomyl.In his revision of the genus Penicillium, Pitt (7) placed P. solitum Westlingin synonymy with P. aurantiogriseum Dierckx. Available authentic cultures of P. solitum had been maintained in culture for many years and had \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:f2IySw72cVMC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6896902326794354810", "cites_id": ["6896902326794354810"], "pub_url": "https://www.apsnet.org/publications/phytopathology/backissues/Documents/1991Articles/Phyto81n10_1108.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eoAk9x-4tl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
