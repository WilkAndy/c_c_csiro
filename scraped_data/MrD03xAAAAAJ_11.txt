Results can be obtained with the new medium, Aspergillus flavus and parasiticus Agar (AFPA), after 42 h incubation at 30\u00b0C. The medium is thus suitable for use in quality control as a guide to the presence of A. flavus and, potentially, of aflatoxins. AFPA has been extensively tested on peanuts and soils. Results were reproducible and comparable with those on standard fungal enumeration media incubated for much longer periods. A very low percentage of false positives or negatives was found."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 445, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3241914452265063611", "cites_id": ["3241914452265063611"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/54/1/109/6729642", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:u9R2lwSY_SwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 8, "1987": 7, "1988": 1, "1989": 3, "1990": 7, "1991": 4, "1992": 3, "1993": 5, "1994": 16, "1995": 9, "1996": 6, "1997": 7, "1998": 6, "1999": 9, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 8, "2003": 11, "2004": 8, "2005": 12, "2006": 4, "2007": 12, "2008": 13, "2009": 16, "2010": 12, "2011": 22, "2012": 26, "2013": 17, "2014": 22, "2015": 18, "2016": 19, "2017": 14, "2018": 29, "2019": 16, "2020": 18, "2021": 19, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
