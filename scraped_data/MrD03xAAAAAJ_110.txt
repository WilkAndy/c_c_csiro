Critical examination has shown that work reportedly on A. flavus has frequently used isolates correctly identified as A. parasiticus. Several studies reportedly on A. flavus have also actually examined the physiology of the recently described species Aspergillus nomius. Correct identifications are provided where possible. In light of this report, further physiological studies on A. flavus, using correctly identified isolates, are urgently needed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15460924146741623655", "cites_id": ["15460924146741623655"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X22124701", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZzvLkZg8kNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 6, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
