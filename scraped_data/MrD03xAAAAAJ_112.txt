The rare bolaamphiphilic scaffold consists of \u03b2-d-mannose linked to a pyrrolizidinedione unit via a 26-carbon chain. The most abundant metabolite displayed potent in vitro antifungal activity. Comparative genomics identified the hybrid PKS-NRPS bua gene cluster, which was verified by heterologous pathway reconstitution in Aspergillus nidulans."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5698270521087819612", "cites_id": ["5698270521087819612"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b04042", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XP-EI9lSFE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 1}}
