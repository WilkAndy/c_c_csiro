For reasons which they admitted were purely arbitrary, they placed two species described by Dierckx (1901), P citreoroseum and P brun-neorubrum, in synonymy with P cyaneofulvum Biourge (1923), a later name. Subse-quent authors (Samson & al., 1976, 1977; Pitt, 1980, 1988) have taken up P chrysogenumand, with the exception of R griseoroseum, have placed the other species names in synonymy. Pitt (1980) clearly recognized the close affinity between P griseoroseum and P chrysogenum and considered that P griseoroseum might be a deteriorated strain of P chrysogenum. Both species names, P chrysogenum and P griseoroseum, were lectotypified by Pitt (1980).
