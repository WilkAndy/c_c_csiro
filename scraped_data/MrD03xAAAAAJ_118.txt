Spores were heated and subsequently incubated in the same medium. After germination, hyphae and germ tubes were stained with lactofuchsin, and the germinated spores were counted with the aid of a microscope. A number of xerophilic strains were examined, mostly isolates from spoiled highmoisture prunes. Of these, ascospores of Aspergillus chevalieri, A. mangini, and Xeromyces bisporus were the most heat-resistant. A decimal reduction curve obtained for A. chevalieri was specified by a z value of 23 F and an F180 of 2.2 min."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17020972403432086501", "cites_id": ["17020972403432086501"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/am.20.5.682-686.1970", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5dtLTjikNuwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 3, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
