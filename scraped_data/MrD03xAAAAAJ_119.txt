In the genus Eupenicillium, Q-9 occurred in all 21 species tested. In the genus Penicillium, isolates belonging to subgenera Aspergilloides, Furcatum, and Penicillium were of Q-9 except for the two species P. megasporum (Q-10) and P. asperosporum (Q-10(H2)) placed in series Megaspora. In subgenus Biverticillium, species in section Coremigena had Q-9, but Q-10(H2) was found in section Simplicia, and also in the genus Geosmithia, except for G. argillacea (Q-10). Almost all isolates in Talaromyces had Q-10(H2), but sometimes Q-10(H4), except for T. thermophilus, T. leycettanus, T. avellaneus and T. striatus, all of which had Q-10. Eladia, Penicilliopsis and Dendrosphaera had Q-9, but Q-10(H2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7591079840100317494", "cites_id": ["7591079840100317494"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756209808186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NvnOMuXuWGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 4, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 5, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
