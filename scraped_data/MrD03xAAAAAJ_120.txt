Although, in Penicillium, a large measure of agreement existed, in the final analysis speciation depended on the concepts of the individual taxonomist. The resulting lack of agreement was nowhere more obvious than in Penicillium subgenus Penicillium. Recent developments have changed all this. In particular, the introduction of simple techniques for studying secondary metabolites and improved methods for distinguishing isoenzymes by gel electrophoresis have resulted in independent methods for assessing species concepts.Backed by accurate identifications using traditional methods, careful studies using secondary metabolite profiles and isoenzyme patterns have produced remarkably consistent results both within and between species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5551165560229067630", "cites_id": ["5551165560229067630"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-3579-3_10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bvvVaqqzCU0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
