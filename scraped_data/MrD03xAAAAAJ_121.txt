Comparative sequence analysis showed only 31 (1.7%) nucleotide differences between these two species representing different genera. Nucleotide sequence variation within the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS 1 and ITS 2) and the 5.8 S ribosomal RNA gene was examined in 101 isolates belonging to 31 taxa within Penicillium subgenus Penicillium. A 600 bp region spanning the ITS spacers and the 5.8 S ribosomal RNA gene has been analysed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. The ITS 1-5.8 S-ITS 2 region is extremely conserved between closely related Penicillium species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4937237569773721382", "cites_id": ["4937237569773721382"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3KJewsIL5vQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA179&dq=info:JlcTPmmXhEQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=eOeo2XKXr0&sig=oEMNJczlAiOmL0RWyOq1Jiftu9k", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JlcTPmmXhEQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
