Enzymes studied were pectinases, ribonucleases, amylases and proteases. Methods used were similar to those previously published, with some additional media.Very well defined patterns were obtained for each enzyme and substrate system. A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. tamarii and A. nomius produced distinct patterns. However, A. oryzae produced patterns very similar to those of A. flavus, and A. sojae to those of A. parasiticus. Consequently, isoenzyme patterns could not be used to distinguish the domesticated species from their wild types."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10405435041283858801", "cites_id": ["10405435041283858801"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-3579-3_22", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cWEgKQqIZ5AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
