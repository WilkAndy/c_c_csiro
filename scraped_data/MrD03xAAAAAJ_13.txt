Mycotoxin production was also assessed. It was concluded that conidial wall texture was the most effective criterion for distinguishing A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A. flavus has a broad interface with VA. oryzae; therefore, a combination of characters was necessary to separate these two species. Mycotoxin production correlated well with morphological speciation. Only A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates produced B aflatoxins. Very few A. flavus isolates produced G aflatoxins whereas almost all A. parasiticus isolates did. The A. parasiticus isolates never produced cyclopiazonic acid, but some isolates of A. flavus, A \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 425, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2112864075525798013", "cites_id": ["2112864075525798013"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000715368880010X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fThmqK5mUh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 6, "1990": 13, "1991": 8, "1992": 6, "1993": 5, "1994": 13, "1995": 10, "1996": 10, "1997": 7, "1998": 8, "1999": 11, "2000": 9, "2001": 11, "2002": 10, "2003": 10, "2004": 6, "2005": 12, "2006": 5, "2007": 12, "2008": 15, "2009": 21, "2010": 11, "2011": 16, "2012": 17, "2013": 14, "2014": 17, "2015": 15, "2016": 17, "2017": 17, "2018": 17, "2019": 22, "2020": 15, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 7}}
