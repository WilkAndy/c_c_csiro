A polyphasic approach was applied using morphological characters, extrolite data as well as partial \u03b2-tubulin, calmodulin and ITS sequences to characterize this taxon. A. bertholletius is represented by nineteen isolates from samples of brazil nuts at various stages of production and soil close to Bertholletia excelsa trees. The following extrolites were produced by this species: aflavinin, cyclopiazonic acid, kojic acid, tenuazonic acid and ustilaginoidin C. Phylogenetic analysis using partial \u03b2-tubulin and camodulin gene sequences showed that A. bertholletius represents a new phylogenetic clade in Aspergillus section Flavi. The type strain of A. bertholletius is CCT 7615 (\u200a=\u200aITAL 270/06\u200a=\u200aIBT 29228)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6489564668475183520", "cites_id": ["6489564668475183520"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042480", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oJFjy66QD1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
