More than 1700 samples were examined, including maize, peanuts, rice, soybeans, mung beans, sorghum, cashews, spices, and herbs. Samples were collected randomly from farm storage, middlemen, and retail shops, to follow the time course of infection. Fungi were detected and enumerated by direct plating on Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol agar and Dichloran 18% Glycerol agar after surface disinfe,: tion in 10% chlorine solution. By this means only fungi actually growing in the foodstuffs were detected. More than 35000 fungi were isolated and identified. The major fungi found in maize were Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium moniliforme. In peanuts. the predominant fungi were A. flavus and A. niger. The most common Fusarium species were F. semitectum and F. equisefi, while Penicillium citrinum and Eurotiurn species were isolated frequently also. Infections in rice and beans were dominated by field fungi. In paddy rice, Trichoconiella padwickii (-Alternaria padwickii) was most commonly encountered. The dominant Fusarium species was F. semitecfum. Aspergillus species, including A. flavus, were less common. Polished rice was practically free of fungi. presumably duc to the heat generated during the dehulling process. Infection levels in most bean samples were low. F. semitectum was the species most commonly isolated from mung beans, while higher levels of A. flavus were found in soybeans than other beans. Selected samples were assayed for aflatoxins.
