(Rev. Iber. Micol. 17: 22, 2000) recommended that the genus Chrysosporium be restricted to species belonging to Onygenales. Using nrLSU genes, we studied the majority of clades examined by Vidal et al. and showed that currently accepted species in Chrysosporium phylogenetically belong in six clades in three orders. Surprisingly, the xerophilic species of Chrysosporium, long thought to be a single grouping away from the majority of Chrysosporium species, occupy two clades, one in Leotiales, the other in Eurotiales. Species accepted in Leotiales are related to the sexual genus Bettsia. One is the type species B. alvei, and related asexual strains classified as C. farinicola, the second is C. fastidium transferred to Bettsia as B. fastidia. Species in the Eurotiales are transferred to Xerochrysium gen. nov., where the accepted species are X. xerophilum and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9391402088670562224", "cites_id": ["9391402088670562224"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.5598/imafungus.2013.04.02.08", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sAcSHnH2VIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 5}}
