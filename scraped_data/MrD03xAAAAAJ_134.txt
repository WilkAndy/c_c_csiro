The technique has been applied to the very difficult Penicillium subgenus Penicillium with notable success. Results have reinforced some aspects of accepted taxonomies and provided a basis for re-examination of others. The zymogram technique should have broad applicability to other fungal genera."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16677615108400782512", "cites_id": ["16677615108400782512"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/3153163", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sJzqTJTKcucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 8, "1991": 3, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
