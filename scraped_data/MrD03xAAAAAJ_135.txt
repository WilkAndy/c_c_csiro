A theoretical interactive model for the ecology of reef-building corals is proposed in this review. This model includes five principle partners that exist in a dynamic equilibrium: polyps of a colonial coelenterate, endosymbiotic zooxanthellae, endolithic algae (that penetrate coral skeletons), endolithic fungi (that attack the endolithic algae, the zooxanthellae and the polyps) and prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms (which live in the coral mucus). Endolithic fungi and fungus-like boring microorganisms are important components of the marine calcium carbonate cycle because they actively contribute to the biodegradation of shells of animals composed of calcium carbonate and calcareous geological \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15427756990064398482", "cites_id": ["15427756990064398482"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21501203.2017.1352049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kpDWIT5nGtYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 8, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
