Physiological and biochemical techniques, applied in conjunction with morphology, have enabled the taxonomy of this difficult genus to approach consensus. Such information, plus existing molecular data, have been used here to construct a hypothetical phylogeny. The proposed phylogeny is based on a number of postulates, including the following: (i) evolution has proceeded from holomorph to strict anamorph; (ii) an intermediate stage exists, the sclerotigenic anamorph; (iii) Eupenicillium and Talaromyces, the Penicillium holomorphs, are of separate (though related) origin; (iv) species in Penicillium have arisen on multiple occasions from these holomorphic genera; and (v) evolution among Penicillium species is away from floccose growth and sparsely produced penicilli, away from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3774591739569878508", "cites_id": ["3774591739569878508"], "pub_url": "https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/b95-321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7LUvQTALYjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
