At High Aw Growth Of P. Pisce Was Similar On Media Containing Either Solute, But Below 0\u00b790 aW Growth Was More Rapid On Nacl Media, Indicating That P. Pisce Can Be Classified As A Halophilic Fungus. The Minimum aW For Growth On Nac1-Based Media Was 0\u00b7746; On Glucose/Fructose Media The Minimum Was 0\u00b7700 aW. Optimal Growth, I.E. Growth At 80% Or More Of The Maximum Growth, Occurred Between 0\u00b796 And 0\u00b791 aW at 30 \u00b0C. Over the wide range of temperatures studied, B. halophila exhibited more rapid growth on NaCl media than on glucose/fructose media over the entire range of aW at which growth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7764187356713970584", "cites_id": ["7764187356713970584"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-134-8-2255", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mOuDtkPvv2sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
