Ciegler, D. I. Fennell, G. A. Sansing, R. W. Detroy, and G. A. Bennett, Appl. Microbiol. 26:271-278, 1973) and the mycotoxins produced by them. Cultures derived from the types of these two species and authentic cultures from each group and from many other sources were examined culturally, microscopically, and for mycotoxin production. It was concluded that P. viridicatum group II has affinities with P. verrucosum and not with P. viridicatum, as indicated by J. I. Pitt in the 1979 monograph (The Genus Penicillium and Its Teleomorphic States Eupenicillium and Talaromyces). As a result of this study it can now be unequivocally stated that the mycotoxins ochratoxin A and citrinin are not produced by P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 386, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2006125058520703059", "cites_id": ["2006125058520703059"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.53.2.266-269.1987", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:U-AioBww1xsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 4, "1990": 3, "1991": 7, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 9, "2001": 9, "2002": 11, "2003": 14, "2004": 13, "2005": 24, "2006": 21, "2007": 18, "2008": 10, "2009": 17, "2010": 23, "2011": 9, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 11, "2015": 20, "2016": 13, "2017": 20, "2018": 23, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 14, "2022": 10, "2023": 2}}
