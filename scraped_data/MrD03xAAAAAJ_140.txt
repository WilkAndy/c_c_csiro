Cultivation and fractionation of secondary metabolites from A. kumbius revealed a unique chemotype comprising three new bis-indolyl benzenoids, kumbicins A\u2013C, and a new bis-indolyl benzoquinone, kumbicin D, along with the previously reported compounds asterriquinol D dimethyl ether, petromurins C and D, aspochracin, its N-demethyl analogue JBIR-15, and neohydroxyaspergillic acid. The structures of kumbicins A\u2013D were assigned by detailed spectroscopic analysis. Kumbicin C was found to inhibit the growth of mouse myeloma cells (IC50 0.74\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u20131) and the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis (MIC 1.6\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u20131)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4921176126074604380", "cites_id": ["4921176126074604380"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH15488", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XEvP95yHS0QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 7, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
