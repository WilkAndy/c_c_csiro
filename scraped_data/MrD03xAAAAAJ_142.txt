Isoenzyme patterns obtained for the isolate were different from those known for other members of subgenus Penicillium, but were identical with patterns from two other unusual isolates, FRR 942 and FRR 1668 (Cruickshank and Pitt, 1987). These isolates are described as Penicillium allii Vincent et Pitt, sp. nov.The methods, media and plating regime described by Pitt (1979) were followed, ie, cultures were incubated for 7 days on Czapek yeast autolysate agar (CYA) at 5, 25, and 37 C, and on malt extract agar (MEA) and 25% glycerol nitrate agar (G25N) at 25 C. For comparative data, cultures were also grown under the regimes of Ramirez (1982) and Raper and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14914873722223636906", "cites_id": ["14914873722223636906"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00275514.1989.12025662", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qrHywqBG_M4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
