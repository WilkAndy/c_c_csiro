At 20\u00b0, the fungus was able to germinate from 0.99 to 0.69 aw on glucose-fructose based media, and from 0.99 to 0.75 on salt-based media. At 30\u00b0, the lowest aw at which germination occurred on both solutes was 0.78 aw. At 34\u00b0, germination occurred over a narrower aw range on glucose-fructose media (0.95\u20130.83aw) and only at 0.87 aw on NaCl media. Growth followed germination except at very low aw values. W. sebi grew faster at 20\u00b0 than at the higher temperatures, and growth rates on glucose-fructose media were significantly higher than on NaCl media."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3197955302868178236", "cites_id": ["3197955302868178236"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000715368880144X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PNUIi2drYSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
