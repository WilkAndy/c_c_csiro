As a consequence, it is capable of growth in dried and concentrated foods usually regarded as safe from microbial attack, and has been the cause of significant spoilage of such products. Cultural and microscopic features of this unique fungus are described in this paper, together with its physiological properties and techniques for its isolation and maintenance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11193333639814840760", "cites_id": ["11193333639814840760"], "pub_url": "https://alumni.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vol-42-No-1-1982.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uAGY_aO1VpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
