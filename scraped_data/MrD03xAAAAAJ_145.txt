Using haploid cultures derived parasexually or from isolated single ascospores, hybrids were produced between mostMetschnikowia taxa. The results provided strong evidence for the acceptance ofM. bicuspidata as type of the genus, and enabled clarification of the relationships among the recognized species. Speciation was based primarily on ascus and ascospore morphology, as classification based on physiological properties was shown to be ineffective.Metschnikowia bicuspidata var.californica var. nov. is described, and some possible evolutionary trends are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8044878633251994038", "cites_id": ["8044878633251994038"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02069037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tnkdTH4mpW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
