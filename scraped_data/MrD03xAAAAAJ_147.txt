After extensive tests with commonly occurring species in Penicillium subgenus Penicillium, a new formulation was derived, which is termed neutral creatine sucrose agar. This medium produced eight different reactions among the 20 species tested, and hence has the potential to be a very useful taxonomic medium for species in this difficult subgenus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4173554131883596961", "cites_id": ["4173554131883596961"], "pub_url": "https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1993.tb01595.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oRzJ2V5x6zkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
