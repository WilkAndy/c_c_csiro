All species grew most rapidly on glucose/ fructose and were partly or highly inhibited by NaCl. Aspergillus wentii was surprisingly tolerant of NaCl at 25 \u00b0C, with high growth rates on both NaCl and glucose/fructose media near 0.95 aw. The minimum aw levels for germination of the fungi examined were as follows: E. rubrum, 0.72 at 20\u00b0, A. penicillioides, 0.73 at 25\u00b0, A. wentii, 0.76 at 25\u00b0 and A. flavus, 0.83 at 34\u00b0."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4583814705034650444", "cites_id": ["4583814705034650444"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000715368880038X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TGPNKTD7nD8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
