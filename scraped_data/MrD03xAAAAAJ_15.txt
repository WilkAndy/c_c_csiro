Samples came from four regions: Alta Paulista (western area of S\u00e3o Paulo State), Sorocabana (southwest S\u00e3o Paulo State), Alta Mogiana (northeast S\u00e3o Paulo State) and Cerrado Mineiro (western area of Minas Gerais State). Cherries and beans were examined at different stages: immature, mature and overripe cherries from trees, overripe cherries from the ground and beans during drying and storage on the farm. For mycological studies, the cherries and beans were surface disinfected with chlorine, plated on Dichloran 18% Glycerol Agar at 25 \u00b0C for 5\u20137 days and analysed for the presence of Aspergillus ochraceus and closely related species, A. carbonarius and A. niger. More than 800 isolates of fungi belonging to these species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 381, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11991541276278745845", "cites_id": ["11991541276278745845"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160502003100", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9WoHwkGDaqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 18, "2005": 22, "2006": 22, "2007": 28, "2008": 27, "2009": 8, "2010": 20, "2011": 22, "2012": 24, "2013": 17, "2014": 25, "2015": 23, "2016": 13, "2017": 14, "2018": 18, "2019": 16, "2020": 19, "2021": 18, "2022": 11, "2023": 5}}
