Biocontrol by competitive exclusion is one approach for reducing preharvest aflatoxin. This paper describes the methods used for preparing and disseminating biocontrol substrate in maize fields, followed by a discussion of the merits of, and problems associated with, the practical use of biocontrol for reducing aflatoxin in maize in Africa. The weight of evidence indicates that biocontrol is an effective process for reducing aflatoxin, but proof of claimed efficacy for smallholder farms in Africa is lacking. Indeed, an examination of sampling methodology in use in Africa indicates that proof of efficacy may be difficult or indeed impossible to obtain."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:silx2ntsSuwC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5821485684959165264", "cites_id": ["5821485684959165264"], "pub_url": "https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/WMJ2018.2410", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:UDsDDWMSylAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
