For example, under the Botanical Code prevailing at the time, Samson et al. (1976) and Pitt (1979) had no alternative to taking up earlier names for currently accepted species, at least in cases where it could be shown that well documented neotypes existed. In particular, Samson et al. (1976) revived P. verrucosum Dierckx for P. viridicatum Westling, while Pitt (1979) took up P. aurantiogriseum Dierckx 1901 for P. cyclopium Westling 1911 and P. glabrum (Wehmer) Westling 1893 for P. frequentans Westling 1911. Both Samson et al. (1976; 1977) and Pitt (1979) evaded the issue of the relationship of P. griseoroseum Dierckx 1901 with P. chrysogenum Thorn 1910, clearly in the hope that a method might eventuate for saving the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16407640593454228522", "cites_id": ["16407640593454228522"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-3579-3_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KmQeNzCms-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
