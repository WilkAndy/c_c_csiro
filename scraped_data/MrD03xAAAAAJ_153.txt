Most groundnut soils in Kingaroy contained detectable levels of Aspergillus flavus, while surrounding virgin soils did not. Levels of A. flavus in groundnut soils varied widely. Some fields contained consistently high levels over several years. The A. flavus/A. parasiticus ratio also varied widely from farm to farm. Invasion of groundnuts by A. flavus took place before groundnuts were harvested. Most aflatoxin was produced postharvest. Under the most favorable conditions, groundnuts require 6 to 10 days to dry in the field after harvest, a period sufficiently long for aflatoxin to reach unacceptable levels. Preharvest invasion led to the production of unacceptable aflatoxin levels at shelling intake"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8906819060829112150", "cites_id": ["8906819060829112150"], "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QX9000077", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vsdl175gm3sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
