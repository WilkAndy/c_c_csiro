The structures of 1\u201311 were established by NMR spectroscopic data analysis, and the absolute configurations were determined from optical rotations and ECD spectra in conjunction with TD-DFT calculations. The secondary metabolite profile of A. banksianus is unusual, with the 11 most abundant metabolites belonging to a single isochromanone class. Conjugation of 1 with endocrocin, 5-methylorsellinic acid, 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid, mercaptolactic acid, and an unknown methylthio source gave rise to five unprecedented biosynthetic hybrids, 5\u20139.
