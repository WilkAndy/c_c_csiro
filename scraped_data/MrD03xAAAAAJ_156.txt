Wageningen, Netherlands, Wageningen Academic Publishers", "pages": "33-42", "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that if a mycotoxin is found in a particular commodity in one location, it will occur everywhere. The true picture is much more complex. Some cereal crops are grown over very wide areas of the globe, with marked differences in both temperature and rainfall patterns. Wheat and barley grown in Northern Europe and parts of Canada, with short cool, growing seasons, are often contaminated with ochratoxin A due to growth of Penicillium verrucosum, a species which grows only below 30 C. However, in warmer climates such as the United States and Australia, P. verrucosum is at most very uncommon, so small grains from those areas do not contain ochratoxin A. The ecology of the Fusarium species which grow and produce trichothecenes in small grains is also complex. F. graminearum and relatives, the producers of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol and zearalenone, grow over a wide temperature \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=449467107983476896", "cites_id": ["449467107983476896"], "pub_url": "https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/978-90-8686-585-7#page=35", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oMiTDfTTPAYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
