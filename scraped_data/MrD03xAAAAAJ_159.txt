A second problem is the potential presence of ochratoxin A in grapes and grape products, resulting from infection by Aspergillus carbonarius. Good quality control before and during wine making ensures ochratoxin A is kept to very low levels, but in dried vine fruit, ochratoxin A levels may be higher. Fusarium toxins sometimes occur in cereals in Australia, but probably to a lesser extent than in grains from any other region. In Southeast Asia, aflatoxin is also the major problem, but because quality control is not so effective, levels may be very high in peanuts and maize, with significant consequences for human and animal health. Southeast Asia has few identifiable problems with ochratoxin A or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15449170818002414000", "cites_id": ["15449170818002414000"], "pub_url": "https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/pdf/10.3920/978-90-8686-523-9#page=71", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sGldeQF7ZtYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
