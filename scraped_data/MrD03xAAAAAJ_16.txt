Since Thom and Church (1926), Thom and Raper (1945) and Raper and Fennell (1965), these clusters have been called \u201cgroups\u201d, a category without nomenclatural standing. In a few cases \u201cseries\u201d were named, which do have a nomenclatural status (when described before 1935 even without a Latin diagnosis), but they do not compete for priority unless at the same rank. For the sake of simplicity in citation, we prefer to introduce new sections rather than new combinations from previous series. In contrast, in Penicillium subgenera and sections were named at the beginning of the century and a complete scheme was formally devised by Pitt (1979)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 318, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15009202107190932292", "cites_id": ["15009202107190932292"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-1856-0_5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RPMoWctlS9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 16, "1991": 5, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 9, "1995": 6, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 11, "2001": 9, "2002": 8, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 9, "2006": 3, "2007": 11, "2008": 8, "2009": 10, "2010": 3, "2011": 10, "2012": 14, "2013": 18, "2014": 14, "2015": 12, "2016": 18, "2017": 12, "2018": 13, "2019": 7, "2020": 19, "2021": 13, "2022": 18, "2023": 2}}
