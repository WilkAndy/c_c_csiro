The model coefficients were used in a novel way to quantify the \u2018relatedness\u2019 of the four species in terms of how their growth rate varies with aw. This \u2018relatedness\u2019 can be described by a linear model whereA. oryzaeandA. parasiticusare very close to each other, placed betweenA. nomiusandA. flavusand closer to the latter species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12788647912432569055", "cites_id": ["12788647912432569055"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002096900969", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:34oV6oRnerEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 5, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
