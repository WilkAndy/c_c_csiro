This interaction has always been a part of man\u2019s environment, although only recently has it become a subject for scientific study. The concept of food mycology as a discipline is certainly a post World War I1 development and perhaps only dates formally from the publication of the book Food and Beverage Mycology (Beuchat 1979). My concept of food mycology is narrower than that of Beuchat. To me, the beneficial aspects of the food-fungus interaction are classed as food fermentations and food mycology is almost exclusively confined to deleterious aspects, ie food spoilage and mycotoxin production. My definition of food mycology, then, is \u2018the naturally occurring interaction of fungi with foods and animal feeds leading to contamination, spoilage or mycotoxin production\u2019.
