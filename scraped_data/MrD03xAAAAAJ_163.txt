One promising method for combating aflatoxin formation is biocontrol using competitive exclusion, a management strategy currently being studied in maize crops in Thailand. It is important that the strains of Aspergillus flavus used in biocontrol be non-toxigenic and be incapable of reversion to toxigenicity. In the current study, 80 non-toxigenic strains of A. flavus, randomly selected from commercially produced dried maize samples from several sources in Thailand, were screened for their potential as biocontrol strains by examining the 24 aflatoxin biosynthesis genes, using a PCR assay. Assessment of the presence or absence of PCR products provides an indication of the function of pathway genes. Of the 80 strains, 78 showed no PCR products from one or more genes in the aflatoxin biosynthesis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4362713406167324089", "cites_id": ["4362713406167324089"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09583157.2014.888398", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uRVwb7p4izwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
