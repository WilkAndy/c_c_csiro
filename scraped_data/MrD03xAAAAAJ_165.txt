This property enables yeasts to increase rapidly in numbers in liquid environments, which favour the dispersal of unicellular microorganisms. Many yeasts grow readily under strictly anaerobic conditions, again favouring their growth in liquids. On the other hand, reproduction as single cells restricts spreading on, or penetration into, solid surfaces, where filamentous fungi have an advantage. Being eukaryotic organisms, yeasts reproduce more slowly than do most bacteria, and hence do not compete in environments which favour bacteria, i.e. at pH values near neutral or at very high temperatures. In common with filamentous fungi, many yeasts are tolerant of acid conditions. In broad terms, then, yeasts are more likely to be active in acidic, liquid environments than elsewhere. However, many yeasts also \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7299973591163503426,11852944491297549754", "cites_id": ["7299973591163503426", "11852944491297549754"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85640-3_10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QoMI4023TmUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
