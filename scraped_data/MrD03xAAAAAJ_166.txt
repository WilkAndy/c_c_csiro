Now mycologists must choose between genus names formerly applied to taxa with either asexual or sexual reproductive modes, a choice that often influences the breadth of genotypic and phenotypic diversity in a genus, and even its monophyly. We use the asexual genus Aspergillus to examine the problems involved in such choices because (a) 11 sexual generic names are associated with it and (b) phenotypic variation and genetic divergence within sexual genera are low but between sexual genera are high. As a result, in the case of Aspergillus, applying the asexual name to the many sexual genera masks information now conveyed by the genus names and would lead to taxonomic inconsistency in the Eurotiales because this large Aspergillus would then embrace more genetic divergence than neighboring clades comprised of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17842476319010832917", "cites_id": ["17842476319010832917"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.12705/653.10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FcL1u601nfcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
