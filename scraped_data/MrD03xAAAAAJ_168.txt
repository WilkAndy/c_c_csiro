Over this aw range, glucose and sorbitol had similar effects on recovery, whereas at an aw of 0.82 to 0.92, NaCl had a detrimental effect. Colony diameters were generally largest on media containing sorbitol and smallest on media containing NaCl. Maximum colony size and viable population of heat-stressed conidia were observed on media at an aw of ca. 0.92. When the recovery incubation temperature was 20 degrees C, the number of uninjured conidia detected at an aw of 0.82 was reduced compared with the number detected at 25 degrees C, while at 30 degrees C, the number recovered at an aw of 0.97 was reduced. The effect on heat-stressed conidia was magnified. This suggests that W. sebi conidia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8414673790110023104", "cites_id": ["8414673790110023104"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.56.8.2545-2550.1990", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wD1MsDrtxnQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
