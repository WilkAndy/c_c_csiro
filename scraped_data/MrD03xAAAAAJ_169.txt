Thirty five isolates tentatively identified as these species were studied as unknowns by the eight members of the Subcommission. Characters studied included traditional morphology and gross physiology plus secondary metabolite profiles, isoenzyme patterns and DNA restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism. The various approaches provided consistent identifications for most isolates, indicating that the four species could be separated satisfactorily and should be maintained. Statistical models based on morphological and gross physiological data indicated that five characters were of value in distinguishing the species. These were conidial wall texture, colony diameters on Czapek yeast \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4391464513811270888", "cites_id": ["4391464513811270888"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S072320201180202X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6Ex0VbWd8TwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
