Colony diameters were measured at intervals and plotted against time. A flexible growth model describing the change in colony diameter (mm) with respect to time was first fitted to the measured growth data and from the fitted curves the maximum colony growth rates were calculated. These values were then fitted with respect to aw to predict colony growth rates at any aw within the range tested. The optimum aw for each species and time to reach a colony diameter of 3 mm were also calculated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 303, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7969035349258320141", "cites_id": ["7969035349258320141"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168160594901678", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DbkSq22zl24J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 1, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 13, "2002": 7, "2003": 4, "2004": 10, "2005": 10, "2006": 10, "2007": 12, "2008": 10, "2009": 9, "2010": 9, "2011": 17, "2012": 17, "2013": 16, "2014": 17, "2015": 17, "2016": 16, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 16, "2020": 16, "2021": 14, "2022": 11, "2023": 4}}
