The structures of the nanangenines were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis supported by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The compounds were assayed for in vitro activity against bacteria, fungi, mammalian cells and plants. Bioinformatics analysis, including comparative analysis with other acyl drimenol-producing Aspergilli, led to the identification of a putative nanangenine biosynthetic gene cluster that corresponds to the proposed biosynthetic pathway for nanangenines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1786356932737353817", "cites_id": ["1786356932737353817"], "pub_url": "https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/articles/15/256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WcjdcSpqyhgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
