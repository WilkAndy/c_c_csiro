It is important, therefore, to take this fact into consideration when contemplating isolation and enumeration of the significant microorganisms in the food. If the food is of high aw (0.980\u20130.999), bacteria will be the main spoilage organisms, and media of high aw, such as plate count agar, will be adequate to give an overall picture of the microbiological status of the food."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6357767071072745690", "cites_id": ["6357767071072745690"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9780203734148-8/media-methods-detection-enumeration-microorganisms-consideration-water-activity-requirements-ailsa-hocking-john-pitt", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2nj3W3dTO1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
