It was isolated repeatedly using samples of nut shells and flowers from the brazil nut tree, Bertolletia excelsa, as well as bees and ants from the tree ecosystem in the Amazon rainforest. The species produces andrastin A, curvulic acid, penicillic acid and xanthoepocin, and has unique partial \u03b2-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequences. The holotype of P. excelsum is CCT 7772, while ITAL 7572 and IBT 31516 are cultures derived from the holotype."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14476589471325344281", "cites_id": ["14476589471325344281"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GdKBhWwt58gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
