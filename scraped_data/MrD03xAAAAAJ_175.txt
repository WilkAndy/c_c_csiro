The principal causal fungi are Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. Relatively little attention has been paid to reducing aflatoxin formation before harvest. The most promising approach is biocontrol by competitive exclusion. This project aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of locally isolated strains of A. flavus for biocontrol of aflatoxin in maize in Thailand. After a rigorous process utilising molecular methods was used to select non-toxigenic A. flavus strains, field inoculum was produced by using hulled rice coated with A. flavus spores in molasses. Field experiments were conducted over two years in two districts, one of light sandy soil (Chokchai), the other a heavy, close textured, soil (Pakchong). Postharvest treatments representative of local practice were also undertaken.
