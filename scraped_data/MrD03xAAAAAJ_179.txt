These species commonly occur in tropical and subtropical commodities, and are especially important in peanuts and maize. Aflatoxin B1 is the most potent liver carcinogen known, affecting all mammalian species, including man, at low levels in the diet. In synergy with hepatitis B virus, also a liver carcinogen, aflatoxins are responsible for many thousands of deaths per annum. When consumed at higher concentrations, aflatoxins are acutely toxic, and have caused deaths in India and Africa. Aflatoxins are also implicated in retarded growth in children, in liver cirrhosis, and they are also immunosuppressive. Developed countries have stringent regulations to ensure that aflatoxin levels are low in foods and feeds. However, in developing countries, enforcement of regulations is often ineffective. It is estimated that up to 5 billion people in the world are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16356300085868975480", "cites_id": ["16356300085868975480"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16356300085868975480&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eFXpyURA_eIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
