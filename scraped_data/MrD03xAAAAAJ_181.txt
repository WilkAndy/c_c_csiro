The softening developed irrespective of the maturity of the apricots or the orchard from which they were obtained. The softening process took place slowly during storage of the canned apricots at 20 \u00b0C and the optimum period for study of the disorder occurred 6 months after processing. The macerating factor (probably a pectolytic enzyme) was generated early in the growth of the mould on the fruit and sufficient was present 16 h after its inoculation to cause post\u2010processing softening; at this stage the disease was not apparent on the exterior of the fresh fruit which could easily pass factory inspection prior to canning. Mould growth was arrested by dipping the fruit in dichloran and this measure was partially successful in controlling softening."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6336433557959234584", "cites_id": ["6336433557959234584"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.2740230307", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GFQGxb-I71cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
