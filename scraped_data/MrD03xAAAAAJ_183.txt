No doubt exists over the use of this name, as one species described by Link was P. expansum, the common apple rot fungus, now designated as type of the genus (Hawksworth et al. 1976). Penicillium as originally described is associated with two quite different types of ascocarps. One is a very hard (sclerotioid) cleistothecium (Fig. 3.3) and these species were originally included in the genus Eupenicillium F. Ludw. 1892. The second quite different type is composed of fine hyphae woven into a more or less closed structure of indeterminate size, known as a gymnothecium (Fig. 3.3). These species are included in the genus Talaromyces. Penicillium species are ubiquitous, opportunistic saprophytes.
