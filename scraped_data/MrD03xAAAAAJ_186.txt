Trichothecenes produced by these species were extracted by ethyl acetate followed by methanol and a silica gel column was used to clean\u2010up the extract. The extracted samples were derivatized by acetylation with trifluoroacetic anhydride and the derivatives analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Multiple ion detection was used to trace ions characteristic of the trichothecenes expected to be present. Quantitation of those found was based on a known mass of pentabromophenol that was added as an internal standard. Eight species of Fusarium (nineteen strains) were surveyed, of which three species, F. acuminatum, F. equiseti and F. sporotrichioides produced the trichothecenes scirpentriol, diacetoxyscirpenol, neosolaniol, HT\u20102 toxin, T\u20102 toxin, T\u20102 tetraol and deoxynivalenol. Wheat samples were inoculated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16799607600338391666", "cites_id": ["16799607600338391666"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02652039209374118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:clIfuBoyJOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
