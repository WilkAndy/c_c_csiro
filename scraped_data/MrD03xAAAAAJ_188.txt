While food spoilage, mycotoxin production and biodeterioration head the list of their important characteristics, it is true that their potential for economic utility is equally great. Penicillin has been the great success story in biochemical utilization of Penicillium, but the biochemical diversity of these genera is such that their potential for benefiting mankind has only just begun to be tapped. It is imperative, then, that the systematics of these genera be clarified and stabilized, as a matter of urgency. Ideally, identification should be unequivocal, accurate, simple and immutable. In some parts of Penicillium we are approaching this goal, a situation which even a few years ago would have been regarded as unlikely ever to be reached."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16897326920029278064", "cites_id": ["16897326920029278064"], "pub_url": "https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1989.tb03768.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cI_90U5df-oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
