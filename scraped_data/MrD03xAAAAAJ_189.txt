Early usage (Scott 1957) confined the word \u201cxerophile\u201d to filamentous fungi and used the term \u201cosmophile\u201d for yeasts; the term \u201chalophile\u201d was used rather indiscriminately for moulds, yeasts and bacteria with the ability to grow on concentrated salt solutions. Pitt (1975) clarified the situation. He considered that osmophile was an inappropriate term, because high osmotic pressures were not involved in the growth of these fungi, as they balance the outside environment with internal solutes, maintaining just sufficient osmotic pressure to enable growth. The crucial point was that they preferred to grow at reduced water activities. In the absence of a suitable term for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15616344153986302726", "cites_id": ["15616344153986302726"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85640-3_9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BgOa5ERmuNgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2}}
