A. burnettii is a fast-growing, floccose fungus with distinctive brown conidia and is a talented producer of biomass-degrading enzymes and secondary metabolites. Chemical profiling of A. burnettii revealed the metabolites ochratoxin A, kotanins, isokotanins, asperlicin E, anominine and paspalinine, which are common to subgenus Circumdati, together with burnettiene A, burnettramic acids, burnettides, and high levels of 14\u03b1-hydroxypaspalinine and hirsutide. The genome of A. burnettii was sequenced and an annotated draft genome is presented. A. burnettii is rich in secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, containing 51 polyketide synthases, 28 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and 19 genes related to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:T_ojBgVMvoEC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1709256353675906956", "cites_id": ["1709256353675906956"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087184520301262", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jI_u_ph_uBcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
