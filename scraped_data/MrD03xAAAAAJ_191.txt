The literature on Penicillium mycotoxins, and the species producing them, includes contributions from many sources. This chapter provides a summary of knowledge on significant Penicillium mycotoxins and the species producing them. Citreoviridin is also produced by Eupenicillium ochrosalmoneum, which is a relatively uncommon, though widespread species usually associated with cereals. Ochratoxin A (OA) is the most important toxin produced by a Penicillium species. OA was originally described as a metabolite of Aspergillus ochraceus. Patulin was once considered to be a relatively important mycotoxi, but early reports of carcinogenicity have not been substantiated. The most important Penicillium species producing patulin is P. expansum, best known as a fruit pathogen, but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18313627886812433316", "cites_id": ["18313627886812433316"], "pub_url": "https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351072090-13/penicillium-john-pitt", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pIskhogTJ_4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
