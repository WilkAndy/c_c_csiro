It is fortunate that most are produced only in wet conditions, are only acutely toxic, or are formed by species commonly found only in soils or other nonfood sources. The most toxic species grow best at low temperatures, and hence are most commonly found in temperate rather than tropical zones. The major Penicillium toxins are described in this paper. The most important is ochratoxin A, which causes kidney damage in domestic animals and man. It is produced by P. verrucosum, which is common in European barley.Penitrem A. produced by P. crustosum. is a tremorgenie toxin which causes sustained trembling in domestic animals, and may be rapidly lethal. Effects in man remain unknown. About 20 other tremorgenic compounds are made by Penicillium species, but these rarely occur in foods. In past times, citrcoviridin was of major importance. as the cause of acute cardiac beriberi in Japan. It is produced by P. citreonigrum, the cause of'yellow rice'; after yellow rice was banned from sale in Japan in 1910, acute cardiac beriberi ceased to be a problem. Other toxins found in yellow rice include lutcoskyrin, erythroskyrin, cyclochlorotine, and islanditoxin. Produced by P. islandicum, each compound is quite toxic, but their significance in human and animal health remains unclear. Other commonly occurring Penicillium toxins are patulin and citrinin, small molecules with definite acute toxicity, but no known long term effects. Patulin is produced by P. expansum when it eauses \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10965195620136262579", "cites_id": ["10965195620136262579"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/134649/files/PR036.pdf#page=97", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sxvkBlIzLJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
