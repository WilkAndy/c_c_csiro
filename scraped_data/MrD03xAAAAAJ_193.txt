The effects of the aw of diluent and incubation temperature during recovery and colony formation were also investigated. Aleuriospores harvested from 14-day-old cultures grown at 25 degrees C were less resistant to heat inactivation compared with aleuriospores from 20-day-cultures. Increased populations of heat-stressed aleuriospores were recovered as the aw of YGA was decreased from 0.95 (glucose and glycerol) and 0.94 (sorbitol) to 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. In NaCl-supplemented YGA, populations recovered at an aw of 0.94 were greatly reduced compared with populations detected at an aw of 0.92; no colonies were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13476264277145032433", "cites_id": ["13476264277145032433"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.56.10.2951-2956.1990", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8RaEsvVOBbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
