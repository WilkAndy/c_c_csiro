Raper, who together developed the first workable and widely accepted taxonomies of these genera. Both were instrumental also in the development of culture collections for these industrially important fungi. Raper made the invaluable contribution of developing freeze drying techniques suitable for fungi, and this has proved to be of great practical importance. However, they also left a legacy of nomenclatural and taxonomic problems which have been addressed only recently. Moreover, inherent difficulties in achieving consensus on species concepts and on identification of isolates have provided a challenge for modern students of these genera.This paper describes the new approaches which have led to clarification of the systematics of these genera.
