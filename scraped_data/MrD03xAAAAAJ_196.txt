Metschnikoff (Arch. Pathol. Anat. Physiol. 96: 177-195, 1884) for an organism which occurred asa parasite in the body cavity of the freshw ter crustacean Daphnia magna. The outstanding characteristic of this yeast was the elongate, club-shaped ascus which contained a single, needle-shaped ascospore pointed at each end.The first pure cultures of Metschnikowia were obtained from seawater, fish intestines, and kelp in the Pacific Ocean off Southern California (N. van Uden and R. Castelo-Branco, J. Gen. Micro-biol. 26: 141-148, 1961). Physiological studies indicated that the isolates represented two distinct species, which were described as M. zobellii and M. krissii. Experimental pathogenicity for Daph-nia magna was established; the organisms, when observed in Daphnia, corresponded to the mor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4897549034662825181", "cites_id": ["4897549034662825181"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC251898/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3YwiEeaW90MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 2, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1}}
