Opportunist marine fungal pathogens, such as Aspergillus sydowii, are important components of marine mycoplankton and are ubiquitous in the open oceans, intertidal zones and marine sediments. These fungi can cause infection in or at least can be associated with animals which live in these ecosystems. A. sydowii can produce toxins which inhibit photosynthesis in and the growth of coral zooxanthellae. The prevalence of many documented infections has increased in frequency and severity in recent decades with the changing impacts of physical and chemical factors, such as temperature, acidity and eutrophication. Changes in these factors are thought to cause significant loss of biodiversity in marine ecosystems on a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3557136951222351509", "cites_id": ["3557136951222351509"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21501203.2017.1371802", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lTYG6zV9XTEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
