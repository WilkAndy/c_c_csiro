In total, 407 coffee samples were examined at different stages: mature (including immature) and overripe cherries from trees, overripe cherries from soil, and beans during drying and during storage on farm. Thirty six soil samples from coffee plantations were also analysed for the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi. The four regions studied were Alta Paulista (western area of S\u00e3o Paulo State), Sorocabana (southwest S\u00e3o Paulo State), Alta Mogiana (northeast S\u00e3o Paulo State) and Cerrado Mineiro (western area of Minas Gerais State), during the coffee harvest seasons of 1999 and 2000. Cherries and beans were surface disinfected with chlorine, plated on Dichloran 18% Glycerol Agar at 25 C for 5-7 days, and analysed for the presence of Aspergillus ochraceus, A. carbonarius and A. niger. The potential for OTA production by fungal isolates was tested by the agar plug technique and by thin layer chromatography. In total, 872 isolates of these three species were taken from coffee samples from the different regions during this study. Although A. niger was the most common species found (549 isolates), only 3% produced OTA. A. ochraceus was also commonly occurring (269 isolates), with 75% being capable of OTA production. A. carbonarius was found (54 isolates) in only one region, Alta Paulista, which is very hot, and only from beans in the drying yard or in storage. However 77% of the A. carbonarius isolates were capable of producing OTA. Mean infection rates for cherries from the tree were very low \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=749023710587119148", "cites_id": ["749023710587119148"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033056103", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LObjpRgRZQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
