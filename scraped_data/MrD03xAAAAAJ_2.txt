Ltd.", "abstract": "The status of all described P. spp. has been assessed and, from detailed comparative studies of known types and other authenticated cultures, 150 P. spp. are recognized, with 37 E. spp. and 16 T. spp. For each accepted sp. there is a description of colonies grown under standardized conditions, with illustrations of colony appearance and microscopic morphology. Keys are provided to the recognized spp. and chapters are devoted to the history of the genera, nomenclatural problems, techniques for isolation, cultivation and preservation, speciation, evolution and ecology. Details are given of procedures to be followed when an isolate cannot be keyed satisfactorily and there are checklists of accepted spp. and a comprehensive list accounting for, and disposing of, all the P. names in the literature. There is a glossary and an index."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 2359, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15395832494606447130", "cites_id": ["15395832494606447130"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19801362607", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:GvJuThX8qNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 30, "1985": 21, "1986": 49, "1987": 25, "1988": 24, "1989": 32, "1990": 55, "1991": 31, "1992": 24, "1993": 40, "1994": 38, "1995": 37, "1996": 37, "1997": 37, "1998": 36, "1999": 42, "2000": 50, "2001": 51, "2002": 55, "2003": 54, "2004": 71, "2005": 72, "2006": 74, "2007": 74, "2008": 49, "2009": 86, "2010": 77, "2011": 84, "2012": 86, "2013": 96, "2014": 100, "2015": 106, "2016": 92, "2017": 87, "2018": 79, "2019": 70, "2020": 78, "2021": 76, "2022": 71, "2023": 13}}
