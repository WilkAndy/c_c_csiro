Nearly all species studied were able to grow over the entire range examined on a laboratory agar medium. However, in general, Aspergillus species were more tolerant of alkaline pH while Penicillium species appeared to be more tolerant of acidic pH."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 268, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4539147800579323380", "cites_id": ["4539147800579323380"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016816059190063U", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9LWGDOBK_j4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 5, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 7, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 12, "2012": 8, "2013": 9, "2014": 18, "2015": 11, "2016": 16, "2017": 16, "2018": 18, "2019": 24, "2020": 16, "2021": 22, "2022": 24, "2023": 8}}
