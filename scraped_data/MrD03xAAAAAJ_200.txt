The variability in the nuclear rDNA repeat unit was studied by the restriction fragments of total DNA that hybridized to the rDNA repeat unit of Neurospora crassa (pMF2). Each fragment was treated as a taxonomic character with two states, present or absent. Pairwise comparisons of all taxa were used to produce a matrix of similarity coefficients which were subjected to UPGMA cluster analysis.A comparison of 29 species with 21 having multiple isolates showed 14 with a majority of the isolates as closest neighbours. Talaromyces species with Paecilomyces anamorphic states cluster with Byssochlatnys and Thermoascus species having Paecilomyces anamorphic states and not with Talaromyces species having Penicillium anamorphs.
