Link (lc: 16), selected by Fries (lc: 383\u2013as Mucor glauca L.) and Eurotium herbariorum (FH Wigg.) Nees (Syst. Pilze: 96. 1816), the original type. That these names represented sexual and asexual morphs of the same fungus was recognised first by de Bary (in Bot. Zeitung (Berlin) 12: 425. 1854). Although all currently recognised species of Eurotium produce the characteristic Aspergillus asexual fruiting structure, the genus Aspergillus now includes many species characterised by sexual states distinguished both morphologically and phylogenetically from Eurotium. Indeed, Aspergillus has grown into a very \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11379116646643192998", "cites_id": ["11379116646643192998"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.12705/653.17", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ptTmDE2-6p0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
