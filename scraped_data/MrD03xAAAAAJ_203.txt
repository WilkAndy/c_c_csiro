Fifteen isolates of Penicillium citrinum were inoculated onto CCA and incubated at 25 and 30\u00b0C for 10 days. All isolates produced a distinct yellow green fluorescence on CCA when the reverse side of the agar plates were viewed under long wavelength UV light. Detection was optimal at 25\u00b0C after four to 5 days of incubation. Isolates positive by the CCA method also tested positive for citrinin production by the TLC agar plug method after growth on CCA, Czapek yeast extract agar and yeast extract sucrose agar. Control cultures were negative by both methods, indicating that the CCA Petri dish method was suitable for screening cultures for citrinin production.Citrinin \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17648856163972681021", "cites_id": ["17648856163972681021"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article-abstract/57/3/214/6699498", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PQ2OaSxV7fQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
