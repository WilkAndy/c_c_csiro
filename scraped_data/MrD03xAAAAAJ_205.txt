Vegetative growth consists of hyphae that are not readily detached from the substrate and which survive blending poorly. When sporulation occurs, very high numbers of spores may be produced, causing sharp rises in viable counts, often without any great increase in biomass (Pitt, 1984)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12123594062366817459", "cites_id": ["12123594062366817459"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-2662-9_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:s7xo8JCoP6gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
