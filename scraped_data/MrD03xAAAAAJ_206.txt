They are characterised by the production of solitary spores, zygospores, as their sexual state. Zygomycetes of significance here belong in the subphylum Mucoromycotina, the order Mucorales and most in the family Mucoraceae. These fungi are characterised by hyphae with few if any cross walls (septa): the hyphae are essentially unobstructed tubes. Absence of septa facilitates rapid translocation of nutrients and organelles such as mitochondria and nuclei between sites of growth, nutrient adsorption and spore formation. In consequence, Zygomycetes are also characterised by rapidity of growth. Many species are able to fill a Petri dish with loosely packed mycelium and to produce mature spores within two days of inoculation. This chapter outlines the taxonomy of common Mucorales found in foods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4127253477552394080", "cites_id": ["4127253477552394080"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85640-3_6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YI-BsyvzRjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
