Control of aflatoxin levels in peanuts on a commercial scale is possible by colour sorting and aflatoxin assays on shelled peanuts, and this is widely practised in developed countries. However, this procedure is expensive."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9326421783748896162", "cites_id": ["9326421783748896162"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MA/MA03318", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:omXR5TIbboEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
