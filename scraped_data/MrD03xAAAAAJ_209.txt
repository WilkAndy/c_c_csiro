Spoilage of these two classes of foods occurs in quite different ways and is caused by separate types of fungi, so is treated in two separate chapters. Many kinds of foods, however, can undergo spoilage both when fresh and after processing, and so have been included in both chapters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2511994613343989609", "cites_id": ["2511994613343989609"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-6391-4_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aS8Qrspl3CIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
