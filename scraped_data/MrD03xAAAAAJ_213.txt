Three freeze-dried fungal mixtures, containing A. flavus/A. parasiticus and background fungi, were produced and checked for homogeneity. The coefficients of variance were low, ranging from 0.81% to 1.09% for total fungal counts and between 2.50% and 2.72% for counts of A. flavus/A. parasiticus. The laboratories analysed the contents of two vials of each mixture on commercial A. flavus and A. parasiticus agar (AFPA), in-house-made AFPA, and on a standard media, dichloran 18% glycerol agar (DG18). Reproducibility values for counts of A. flavus/A. parasiticus indicated no differences between the commercial AFPA and the in-house-made AFPA.
