The workshop was attended by twenty six people from Australia, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Hungary, the Netherlands, Turkey and the Unites States of America. The workshop proceedings were subsequently published (King et al., 1986). The aims of the workshop were to work towards standardisation of media and methods used in the mycological examination of foods. Attention was concentrated on dilution plating, a universally accepted procedure, and direct plating, a technique for particulate foods or commodities such as grains, where the particles are incubated directly on the media. Methods for estimation of fungi in foods by other methods, such as chitin or ATP assays, and consideration of the taxonomy of food \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14957537249506443299", "cites_id": ["14957537249506443299"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:64b449a3-015e-4733-b431-dc9fd49ad558", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:I0CBR-HYk88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
