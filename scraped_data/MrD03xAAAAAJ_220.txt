Microbiological stability is largely determined by low pH, low oxygen content, pasteurization, and preservatives. This chapter surveys the compositional characteristics of these products and their influence on the microflora of raw materials and end products. It also outlines and discusses the hygienic, preservation, and control requirements for the different product types."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13002900596525936522,7199067229675037445", "cites_id": ["13002900596525936522", "7199067229675037445"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-28801-5_13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iq-kQTOVc7QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
