Results showed that ADM was ineffective in the absence of antibiotics because of bacterialovergrowth. Counts on ADM with antibiotics and AFPA were comparable with DRBC. However, enumeration on the two differential media was much easier than on DRBC, while AFPA was much more effective than ADM with antibiotics in the presence of spreading fungi such as Mucor and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10150950345112215147", "cites_id": ["10150950345112215147"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:b6de1137-4075-45d8-8a3b-d69e513a922f", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a94KjY5r34wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
