Bangkok", "volume": "31", "abstract": "Mycotoxins are toxic metabolises produced by fungi, especially by saprophytic moulds growing on foodstuffs or animal feeds. They must always have been a hazard to man and domestic animals, but until the past 30 years their effects have been largely overlooked. Although poisonous mushrooms are carefully avoided, moulds growing on foods have generally been considered to cause unaesthetic spoilage, without being dangerous to health. Between 1960 and 1970 it was established that some fungal metabolises, now called mycotoxins, were responsible for animal disease and death. In the decade following 1970 it became clear that mycotoxins have been the cause of human illness and death as well, and are still causing it.It is now well established that mycotoxicoses (the diseases caused by mycotoxins) have been responsible for major epidemics in man and animals at least during recent historic times. The most important have been ergotism, which killed thousands of people in Europe in the last thousand years, alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) which was responsible for the death of many thousands of people in the USSR in the 1940s; stachybotryotoxicosis, which killed tens of thousands of horses and cattle in the USSR in the 1930s; and aflatoxicosis, which killed 100,000 young turkeys in England in 1960 and has caused death and disease in many other animals, and perhaps man as well. Each of these diseases is now known to have been caused by growth of specific moulds which produced one or more potent toxins, usually in one specific kind of commodity or feed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8449272837798073917", "cites_id": ["8449272837798073917"], "pub_url": "https://www.fao.org/3/x5036e/x5036e04.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PZZPO-HYQXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
