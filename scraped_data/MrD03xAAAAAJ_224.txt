It is known to affect many animal species and is a powerful kidney toxin. However, its effects, if any, on humans at current levels of exposure remain unclear. It is regarded by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as possibly carcinogenic to humans. OTA was once considered to cause the disease known as Balkan endemic nephropathy, but that now seems unlikely. It is most commonly found in European and Canadian cereals, but also occurs in coffee, cocoa, dried vine fruits and wines. Levels in the diet rarely approach the provisional tolerable weekly intake level established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14747960581531024795", "cites_id": ["14747960581531024795"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14747960581531024795&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:m72exwJIq8wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
