Phylogenetic analysis of the Talaromyces species shows that the majority of the species examined formed a major Talaromyces clade, but that sections and series proposed for these species may not reflect their phylogenetic relationships. Incorporating the strictly mitotic Penicillium species with the meiotic Talaromyces in the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the majority of mitotic species have meiotic species as their closest relatives. Thus, multiple independent losses of a meiotic Talaromyces state have occurred among Penicillium species in subgenus Biverticillium.
