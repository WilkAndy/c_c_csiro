The key adverse effects noted involved toxicity to the kidney. The Committee established a provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 112 ng/kg body weight (bw), on the basis of deterioration of renal function in pigs, for which the lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) was 8 \u03bcg/kg bw per day, and application of a safety factor of 500. At that time, the Committee recommended that further studies be conducted to elucidate the role of ochratoxin A in causing nephropathy in pigs, the mode of action of ochratoxin A as a kidney carcinogen in rodents and the possible role of ochratoxin A in human disease.Ochratoxin A was re-evaluated by the Committee at its forty-fourth meeting (Annex 1, reference 116), when it considered toxicological data that had become available since the previous evaluation, including epidemiological studies of nephropathy, genotoxicity studies and studies on experimental nephrotoxicity. At that meeting, the Committee reconfirmed the PTWI, rounding it to 100 ng/kg bw, and reiterated its request for further studies on ochratoxin A."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:EkHepimYqZsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4137532228753913376", "cites_id": ["4137532228753913376"], "pub_url": "http://re.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/9789241660594_eng.pdf#page=364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IHab9aN3azkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
