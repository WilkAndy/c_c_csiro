Three new species, Torulomyces parviverrucosus, T. laevis, and T. ovatus, are described, and T. brunneus is described as a new combination. Conidial characteristics, especially their shape and surface structure, are useful taxonomic criteria for distinguishing species of Torulomyces. Monocillium is considered to be a distinct genus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6044530554931304543", "cites_id": ["6044530554931304543"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1340354098709118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X9issIN84lMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
