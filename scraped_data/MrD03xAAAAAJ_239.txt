Over 400 coffee (Coffea arabica) samples were examined at different stages of maturation and processing: cherries and overripe from trees, overripe from the soil, patio (drying yard) and barn storage. Results showed that the average ochratoxin A in 135 samples of cherries from trees, overripe from trees, overripe from the soil, patio and barn was 0.12,< 0.2, 1.6, 2.1 and 3.4 \u00b5g/kg, respectively. The highest OA contamination was found in coffee from patio and barn. Only one sample of coffee (floaters type and stored in a barn) presented an OA content of 108.5 \u00b5g/kg. The main causes of the high contamination rates were: the farm located in a region of hydrographic basin affected by heavy mist over the farm; the workers did not turn over the coffee as much as necessary; the coffee layer was very thick; the barn had moisture infiltration from the ceiling and floor; and the presence of birds inside the barn. Moreover, 36% of the coffee samples was contaminated with Aspergillus ochraceus. In Alta Paulista, the ochratoxin A content of samples from patio and barn was 19.75 \u00b5g/kg. OA was also present in samples from Alta Mogiana and Cerrado Mineiro."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16043710192174394585", "cites_id": ["16043710192174394585"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033056104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2Wzeo2q1pt4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
