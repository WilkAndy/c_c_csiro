In cases where reference to such variants is necessary, it is proposed that the tested and widely used \u201cChemotype\u201d terminology now used to communicate such variation in the lichen-forming fungi also be adopted in Penicillium and Aspergillus. Each chemotype is given a Roman numeral, Chemotype I including the metabolite profile of the type of the species name. To avoid ambiguity, the differentiating compounds can be mentioned in parenthesis, e.g. \u201cChemotype II (citrinin)\u201d. The Chemotype terminology avoids the necessity of creating new Latinized names and asigning ranks to them while the situation is unclear, and does not preclude the use of formal scientific names in the rank of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14505140219790930753", "cites_id": ["14505140219790930753"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-1856-0_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QbPeqS2cTMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 1}}
