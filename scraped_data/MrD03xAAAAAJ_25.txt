A disparate literature which had spoken of the separate effects on micro-organisms of salts, sugars, moisture, humectants and osmotic pressure was uni\ufb01ed by his paper. His review marks a watershed in our understanding of microbial water relations.Since 1957, the concept of water activity has provided a basis for an increasing understanding of the in\ufb02uence of other factors on microbial growth at low a,,. The literature also reports some new studies on the role of aw as a fundamental parameter controlling microbial growth. This paper \ufb01rst de\ufb01nes, catalogues and outlines the taxonomy of xerophilic fungi and then reviews the post-1957 literature which concerns their growth and their role in the spoilage of foods of plant origin."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 221, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=871852542169014976", "cites_id": ["871852542169014976"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=XyM7MNCaidcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA273&dq=info:wGKBkERxGQwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=-SkJn_Irqq&sig=Fo7u4KF6x4o5jWFZfNSu1kBqy3U", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wGKBkERxGQwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 6, "1985": 5, "1986": 7, "1987": 4, "1988": 4, "1989": 6, "1990": 8, "1991": 6, "1992": 2, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 6, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
