This paper reports on the use of a microsatellite marker technique for assessing competitiveness. The chosen microsatellite markers were able to differentiate, at an individual level, between the four biocontrol strains used in a study on the biocontrol of aflatoxins in maize in Thailand. The microsatellite markers were then used to determine which of the four biocontrol strains used were identical with 86 nontoxigenic strains of A. flavus taken from dried maize samples produced in that study. Fifty-one of the 86 strains (59%) were identified as one of the four biocontrol strains, with another four likely to be so. Analysis of microsatellites in A. flavus strains taken from dried samples at the conclusion of a field trial was shown to be of value in understanding the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15324970791792422487", "cites_id": ["15324970791792422487"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09583157.2018.1436694", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Vy4Gbr07rdQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
