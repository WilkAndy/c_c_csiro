The first, supplied by Mars Petcare (Thailand) Ltd. was compiled in 2010 from two sets of 295 random samples of maize, one collected at harvest and the second after drying, from two regions that produce more than 70% of the commercially grown maize in Thailand. The second data set was compiled between 1989 and 1993 under a collaborative research project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and project partner countries in South East Asia. It provides aflatoxin concentrations in 108 maize samples randomly selected from retail markets in Thailand. This study shows that, even with the low aflatoxin levels found in the first data \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4054499531487093819", "cites_id": ["4054499531487093819"], "pub_url": "https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/WMJ2014.1836", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O6RGnNd5RDgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
