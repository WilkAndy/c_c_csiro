However, the significance of mycotoxins in human and animal health has only become apparent in the past 60 years, with the discovery of aflatoxins. Since then hundreds of toxic compounds have been identified, both from laboratory experiments and field occurrences. However, most of these compounds occur at low levels and so are of little importance to health. The major mycotoxins of importance in human and animal health are aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol, patulin, and zearalenone. These mycotoxins occur most commonly in cereals and nuts, but also in some other commodities, including coffee and wine. This general section on mycotoxins provides an overview of the subject, with a short account of most compounds considered to be of possible importance.
