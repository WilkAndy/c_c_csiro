The formation of a particular mycotoxin in a crop depends on a number of factors, but one of the most important is whether the causal fungus has an association with the plant producing the crop. Ochratoxin A is produced by species that do not appear to ever participate in a plant-fungus association, while the fumonisins, trichothecenes, zearalenone and patulin occur in food crops only as a result of such an association. Anatoxin is unusual: it is formed both as the result of an interaction between plant and fungus and also in the absence of such an association."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17051488945413982676", "cites_id": ["17051488945413982676"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2008-1001.ch005", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1InmatoOo-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
