On a glycerol-nitrate salts agar of 0.93 water activity, and on Czapek yeast autolysate agar at 5 C and 37 C, extent of growth after 7 days provided taxonomically valuable data; within-species variation was low, while between-species variation was sufficiently marked to assist in determinative classification. Moreover, water relations, as assessed by the above technique, showed a very high correlation with penicillus type in some Sections of the genus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 213, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17350407891526266520", "cites_id": ["17350407891526266520"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00275514.1973.12019533", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:mK6OCg0IyfAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 4, "1985": 2, "1986": 7, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 4, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 7, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 15, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 11, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
