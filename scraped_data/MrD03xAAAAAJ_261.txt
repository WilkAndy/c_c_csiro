The range of fish products is very large and includes foods prepared by a broad spectrum of both traditional and modern food technology methods. In some countries, fish are a major source of protein. In the last two decades, there has been an extensive expansion in finfish- and shellfish-production primarily due to developments in aquaculture. The catches of wild fish have stagnated at ~90 million metric tones since 1990, whereas aquaculture production has increased to ~30 million metric tones in year 2000 (Figure 3.1; FAO, 1998). Today 20\u201330% of fish and shellfish used for human consumption are reared in aquaculture."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8011938683348972046", "cites_id": ["8011938683348972046"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-28801-5_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DvI5j8gfMG8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
