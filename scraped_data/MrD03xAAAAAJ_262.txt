The turkey deaths was traced to toxic feed from Brazil, and led to the discovery that the common mould Aspergillus flavus was a producer of a potent set of hepatotoxins, which became known as aflatoxins. Subsequent work showed that four aflatoxins occurred naturally, named aflatoxins B 1, B2, GI and G2, based on the compounds\u2019 blue or green fluorescence under ultra violet light and their relative position on thin layer chromatography plates. The acute toxicity of aflatoxins to all domestic animal species was established soon after their discovery. Their potential carcinogenicity to animals and, by implication, humans, became evident a few years later (Stoloff, 1977 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9814357852030332029", "cites_id": ["9814357852030332029"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-4439-2_5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fWzVvHeaM4gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1}}
