Many countries in these regions lack a systematic preharvest approach for providing government agencies with warnings of a potential threat to human and animal health resulting from excessive levels of aflatoxin in crops at harvest. This paper sets out an approach to such a system. It is based on the establishment of a surveillance system in each community to monitor aflatoxin contamination resulting from drought stress before harvest and advise on remedial actions. The system should be under the control of a central government coordinator. If severe drought stress occurs, the coordinator would arrange for samples of the affected crop to be provided to a central aflatoxin laboratory established and controlled by the relevant government department. Assays from the central laboratory would be sent via the central coordinator to a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3647587685679840371", "cites_id": ["3647587685679840371"], "pub_url": "https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/WMJ2018.2317", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:czwJpKzVnjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
