It has a widespread occurrence wherever these crops are grown and is found in association with deoxynivalenol, though its occurrence is less frequent. Its importance as a mycotoxin lies in its estrogenic properties, as it causes a variety of reproductive disorders in female farm animals, especially pigs. Some hormonal effects, occasionally seen in girls, may have been associated with ZEA intake. ZEA is heat stable and sometimes occurs in finished cereal products, including bread. As exposures to ZEA rarely exceed levels considered safe by international regulatory authorities, no international regulations for ZEA exist in foods or feeds. National regulatory limits vary widely."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11423644115866518410", "cites_id": ["11423644115866518410"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11423644115866518410&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ioO0XszviJ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
