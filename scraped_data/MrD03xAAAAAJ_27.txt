The storage of cereals probably initiated the transition by mankind from hunter-gatherer to cultivator, at the same time providing a vast new ecological niche for fungi pathogenic on grain crops or saprophytic on harvested grain, many of which produced mycotoxins. Grains have always been the major source of mycotoxins in the diet of man and his domestic animals. In the historical context, ergotism from Claviceps purpurea in rye has been known probably for more than 2000 years and caused the deaths of many thousands of people in Europe in the last millennium. Known in Japan since the 17th century, acute cardiac beriberi associated with the consumption of moldy rice was found to be due to citreoviridin produced by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 203, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7902718534268352372", "cites_id": ["7902718534268352372"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b04494", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dPf18qIYrG0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 6, "2018": 18, "2019": 20, "2020": 45, "2021": 54, "2022": 37, "2023": 21}}
