Nutritional advice is to limit the amount of fat in the overall diet, in particular of saturated fat. As a result, the past decades have shown a reduction in the per capita consumption of oil- and fat-based foods in developed countries and a relative shift to low-fat/low-calorie products. Fats and oils can be attacked by various fat-splitting microorganisms if the conditions for growth are favorable, e.g. temperature, moisture, availability of low-molecular weight nutrients. Enzymes produced by contaminating lipolytic flora can hydrolyze the fat to yield free fatty acids and trigger fatty acid oxidation. At the same time, fats and oils can protect microorganisms so that they may survive for quite some time (Troller and Christian, 1978; Hersom and Hulland, 1980; Gaze, 1985). This would present a hazard in particular \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3104508781372013959", "cites_id": ["3104508781372013959"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-28801-5_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:h33Cy0luFSsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
