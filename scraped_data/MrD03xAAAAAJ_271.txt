These fungi are frequently found associated with a number of human and animal food crops, including sorghum, maize, nuts (especially peanuts) and cottonseed, making aflatoxins an important food safety issue in endemic regions.Economic and health concerns have prompted numerous studies aimed at understanding and controlling aflatoxin biosynthesis. The aflatoxin pathway is now well characterised, and involves as many as 17 different enzymatic steps, which convert a polyketide precursor to aflatoxins B1 and B2 in A. flavus, and to B1, B2, G1 and G2 in A. parasiticus (Bhatnagar, et al., 1992; Klich and Cleveland, 1998). The pathway is governed by aflk, a regulatory locus, whose gene product contains a putative zinc finger DNA-binding motif (Woloshuk, et al., 1994). This appears to act at several steps in the biosynthetic pathway, in particular the conversion of acetate to the first biosynthetic intermediate, norsoloronic acid (Payne, et al., 1993)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:z8nqeaKD1nsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9608254298927466714", "cites_id": ["9608254298927466714"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=n0lZDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA435&dq=info:2ggxz2BgV4UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=aMgkPY4gFj&sig=2jODrBHnQM1VD-DTsjvh_CHvoeo", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2ggxz2BgV4UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
