Harwood Scientific Publishers, Reading, MA", "pages": "113-125", "abstract": "Four species of Penicillium, with two isolates of each, were examined in an international collaborative study with 15 participants from 8 countries,. The important morphological attributes studied were stipe ornamentation and conidium form. All 8 selected isolates were inoculated on Czapek yeast autolysate (CYA) agar, Blakeslee malt extract agar (MEA), the favourite medium for morphological examinations in the individual laboratory and on MEA at airtight conditions. The identity of the cultures was not revealed, to rule out prejudice. The cultures were examined by slightly different techniques, but all used 1000 x oil immersion microscopy. There was a good agreement on stipe ornamentation between experts even if some experts decided stipes to be rough when at least 5% were rough, whereas other preferred a majority rule decision. There was a significant influence of growth medium on micromorphological features, stipes on MEA were typically more consistently and distinctly rough than those on CYA. Conidium form was also perceived differently by experts and less experienced microscopists. Some of the latter had problems seeing differences between elliptical and globose conidia. Most participants agreed that Penicillium paneum has globose conidia, albeit two participants described them as subglobose. Most experienced taxonomist described the conidia of P. griseofulvum to be elliptical (with some subglobose conidia), whereas less experienced microscopists often regarded these conidia as globose to subglobose. The influence of medium on conidium form was insignificant. It is concluded that standard cultures and an accurate and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16086094157268497375", "cites_id": ["16086094157268497375"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3KJewsIL5vQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA113&dq=info:37N5g2hJPd8J:scholar.google.com&ots=eOeo2XK-o1&sig=xPbkSjp75RrXAWBD6mFOmsox3sI", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:37N5g2hJPd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
