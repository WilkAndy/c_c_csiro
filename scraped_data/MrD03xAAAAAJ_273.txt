Some of these approaches have merit, but despite the expenditure of large sums of money excessive aflatoxin in peanuts remains a serious commercial problem. Other approaches are still needed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7594702909750610933", "cites_id": ["7594702909750610933"], "pub_url": "https://www.aciar.gov.au/sites/default/files/legacy/node/13707/pr89_pdf_33884.pdf#page=22", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9YtP1g7OZWkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1}}
