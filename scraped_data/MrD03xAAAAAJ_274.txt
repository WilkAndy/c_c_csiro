Because this infOrmation is qualitative, decisions on the relationships among species (taxonomy) was often of necessity based on personal opinion. Moreover, correct procedures for naming fungi (nomenclature) were often ignored. A further problem has been that the literature is diffuse, requiring extensive background knowledge to locate information. Clarifying and stabilising both nomenclature and taxonomy of food spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi has become imperative. Improvements to our understanding must inevitably involve the taxonomy of three genera: Penicillium.
