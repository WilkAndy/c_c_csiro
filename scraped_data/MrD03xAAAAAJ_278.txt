All taxonomists have agreed that the genus has a great number of species, many of which look very similar in culture. In addition, relatively few stable, taxonomically valuable characters, are available, and so most identifications require expert knowledge. At the same time, accurate and reproducible classification of Penicillium is of great importance because so many species are of economic significance. Species of Penicillium cause food spoilage, mycotoxin production, plant and human disease and biodeterioration, but also possess enormous potential for economic utility. Penicillin has been the great success story here, but the biochemical diversity of this genus is such that its potential for benefiting mankind has only just begun to be tapped. It is a matter of urgency, then, that Penicillium taxonomy be clarified and stabilised. The first definitive taxonomy was produced comparatively recently, by Raper and Thom1), in its day a masterpiece, and in almost exclusive use for nearly 30 years. But like all fungal taxonomies based exclusively on morphology, it had shortcomings. Inevitably, the taxonomic base, ie the range of characters used to distinguish species, was narrow. Also, Raper and Thom 1) placed too much reliance on colony texture.
