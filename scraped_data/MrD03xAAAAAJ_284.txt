Although consumers will always avoid rotten fruit, commercial juice manufacturing may involve delays after picking that enable rot development, so that apple juice is liable to contain patulin. Patulin is a mycotoxin with moderate toxicity. Patulin does not appear to be carcinogenic or mutagenic at levels likely to be consumed. Because apple juice is frequently consumed by children, long-term toxicity in young people is the main concern. Based on the results of toxicity studies, patulin levels are limited to 50 \u03bcg l\u22121 in many countries. As apples are a cool climate fruit, patulin is more likely to be found in the products of these regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13929507117419628227", "cites_id": ["13929507117419628227"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13929507117419628227&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:w4YS7uuMT8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
