Recently it has been found that Aspergillus niger produces fumonisins in grapes, wines, and dried vine fruits, but only at low concentrations. Fumonisins cause a range of diseases in animals, the most important being leukoencephalomalacia in horses and liver cancer in rats. In areas of high maize consumption, fumonisins may be responsible for esophageal cancer in adults and perhaps spinal defects in neonates. Maize is a dietary staple in parts of Africa, South and Central America, and China, and fumonisin consumption sometimes exceed acceptable levels in those areas. Milling has little effect on fumonisin levels in flour or other fractions. However, nixtamalization, a traditional Central American process, reduces levels very effectively.
