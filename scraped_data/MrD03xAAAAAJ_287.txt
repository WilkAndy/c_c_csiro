How it would affect human health and the economic impact on world trade were the mains aspects of concern. After more than 10 years of research carried out in Brazil, involving the coffee chain throughout from farm to cup, several conclusions and revisions should be taken into account. Until 2004, the major fungal source of OTA in coffee was A. ochraceus and A. carbonarius, with minor contribution from A. niger. After advances in molecular and fungal metabolite techniques, new species were described and distinguished in the section Circumdati and Nigri. Nowadays, A. westerdijkiae is being recognized as the main OTA producer especially in arabica coffee, while A. carbonarius occurs most frequently in robusta coffee. The issue of time of invasion by ochratoxigenic fungi have led to several discussions. In our studies, few cherries on the coffee trees were infected with ochratoxigenic species, indicating that infection mostly occurred after harvest, and the fungal sources were likely to be soil, equipment and drying yard surfaces. Most of the coffee samples did not contain OTA and its production was sporadic and uncommon. OTA formation during transportation was investigated; temperature inside coffee containers changed drastically during the voyage from a coffee exporting country such as Brazil to an importing country such as Italy. These changes induced condensation at the top of the containers.
