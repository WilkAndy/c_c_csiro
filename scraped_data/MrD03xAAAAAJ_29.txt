Eurotium rubrum, E. repens, Wallemia sebi, Aspergillus penicillioides, Penicillium roqueforti, Chrysosporium xerophilum and Xeromyces bisporus were grown at 25, 30 and 37 \u00b0C on media with pH values of 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 and a range of water activities (aw) from 0.92 to 0.70. The aw of the media was controlled with a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. Temperature affected the minimum aw for germination for most species. For example, P. roqueforti germinated at 0.82 aw at 25 \u00b0C, 0.86 aw at 30 \u00b0C and was unable to germinate at 37 \u00b0C. E. repens germinated at 0.70 aw at 30 \u00b0C, but at 25 and 37 \u00b0C, its minimum aw for germination was 0.74. C. xerophilum and X. bisporus germinated at 0.70 aw at all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11389927902977757603", "cites_id": ["11389927902977757603"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160502001666", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o5FM0hQnEZ4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 12, "2008": 5, "2009": 10, "2010": 3, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 14, "2014": 16, "2015": 17, "2016": 14, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 9, "2022": 11, "2023": 11}}
