At the time, there was no connection with any animal or human disease. OA was found as a natural contaminant of maize in 1969 in the USA and, about the same time, studies were being conducted in Scandinavia on a kidney disease in pigs which appeared to be related to mouldy feed. These studies showed that OA was the cause of the disease now known as porcine nephropathy."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7253662456904301280", "cites_id": ["7253662456904301280"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ma/ma03316", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4DpesJIvqmQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
