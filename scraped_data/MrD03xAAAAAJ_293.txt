This meeting was unique in that only mycotoxins were considered: aflatoxin M 1, fumonisins, some trichothecenes including deoxynivalenol and T-2 toxin, and ochratoxin A. Again unique in JECFA meetings, the work schedule dealt not only with toxicology, but with the whole range of factors influencing the estimation of human intake of these toxins, including the causal fungi and their occurrence, sampling plans, methods of estimation, and the occurrence of the toxins in foods around the world. This report will deal only with ochratoxin A, because of its potential importance in coffee. Information available at this date indicates that three major fungal sources of OTA exist in foods: a single Penicillium species, P. verrucosum, Aspergillus ochraceus and some related species, and A. carbonarius, together with the closely related A. niger. Information obtained by JECFA showed clearly that Europe is the major region of the world where OTA commonly occurs in foods. Within Europe, the major sources are cereals and cereal products, which accounted for ca 60% of OTA intake, wines (25% of intake), grape juice and coffee (5-7% each) and all other foods, less than 1% of the total intake. The fungal source of OTA in European cereals was considered to be P. verrucosum. The sources in the other foods were less clear, but species other than P. verrucosum were likely. The Committee concluded that at this time, no cases of acute intoxication in human populations due to intake of OTA have been reported. The Committee agreed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8561122370587549023", "cites_id": ["8561122370587549023"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033056102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X12F8W83z3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
