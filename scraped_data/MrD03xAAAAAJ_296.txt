In all, 75 samples were examined, comprising about 500 fish representing 24 species. Most fish were sampled by direct plating from visible mould growth, but some were also macerated and dilution plated. The major fungal genera isolated were Aspergillus and its ascosporic state Eurotium. The most common Aspergillus species was A. niger, isolated from 36% of samples. A. flavus (27%) andA. sydowii (22%) were also common. Eurotium rubrum (35% of sa mpIes), E. repens (26%), and E. chevalieri (18%) were widespread. Penicillium species were isolated quite frequently, but their incidence was usually attributable simply to the presence of spores rather than to growth. During the course of this study Polypaecilum pisce was described as new; it was found on 42% of samples and was the most common species isolated. Basipetospora halophila, like P. pisce an unusual halophilic xerophile, was found on five occasions. The water relations of several commonly occurring species were investigated and competition between five major species evaluated on media and fish pieces over a range of temperature and water activity.STUDIES on fungi occurring on Indonesian dried fish formed part of one of ACIAR's earliest ACIAR projects (Project 8304), which studied all aspects of fish drying in that country. In collaboration with staff of the Research Institute for Fish Technology, we carried out a comprehensive study of the occurrence of fungi on dried fish in and around Jakarta.
