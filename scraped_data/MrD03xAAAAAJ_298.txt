This microorganism formed distinctive club-shaped asci, containing a single needle-like ascospore, attenuate at both ends, which was remarkably adapted to invasion of the host animal.Several early 20th Century microbiologists reported observing morphologically similar organisms. Two of these investigators named new species, but, like Metschnikoff, made no isolations. It was not until 1960 that pure cultures of yeasts similar to those described by Metschnikoff (1884) were isolated: in California, from ocean water and marine life by van Uden and Castelo-Branco; and in Michigan from trematode larvae by Wickerham. Van Uden and Castelo-Branco (1961), considering Metschnikoff's original description to be inadequate, described their isolates as two new species; however, Wickerham (1964) chose to identify his strains with Metschnikoff's species. Spencer, Phaff and Gardner (1964), agreeing with van Uden and Castelo-Branco's viewpoint, described another new species, and concluded that the strains isolated by Wickerham belonged to it. Little has been published on the taxonomic or phylogenetic position of the genus Metschnikowia. Metschnikoff (1884) considered it to be an Ascomycete, and this has always been accepted, although life cycles have not been clearly defined. Van Uden and Castelo-Branco (1961) and Spencer et al.(1964) did not report having made observations on the life cycles of Metschnikowia species, and although Wickerham"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12191412001846663286", "cites_id": ["12191412001846663286"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12191412001846663286&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dhiBcJ-YMKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1970": 2}}
