Some techniques are similar to those used in food bacteriology, others have been developed to meet the particular needs of food mycology. Most of the media have been specifically formulated for foodborne fungi. The approach taken here is designed to provide a systematic basis for the study of food mycology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Og1tA8FjbJAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16322793216859943117", "cites_id": ["16322793216859943117"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85640-3_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zbAX6fI1huIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
