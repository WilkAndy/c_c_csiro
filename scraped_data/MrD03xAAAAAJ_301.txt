People of all races rely on cereals as their main staple diet, with more than half of the world's population eating rice as their principal food. Therefore, producers, processors, the public and governmental authorities need to be aware of the spoilage, adulteration, and public health problems of these basic foods. This chapter covers only the major grains in commercial production, with less emphasis on small-scale farming and processing (Iizuka, 1957, 1958). For reviews of the microbiology of fermented Oriental and Indian cereal products see Hesseltine (1965, 1979) and Beuchat (1987). Cereals are also the basis for many animal feeds (see Chapter 4), but this chapter covers only human foods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:wUn16MOA3RoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10638864916917989235", "cites_id": ["10638864916917989235"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-28801-5_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cy9DWkbXpJMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
