The study sampled predominantly bottled wines, approximately equal numbers of red and white wines, wines made from a range of grape varieties and wines from all the major producing areas and some of the minor ones. A validated HPLC assay that did not utilise expensive immunoaffinity columns was developed for quantifying OA in wine, with limits of detection and quantification of 0.02 and 0.05 \u00b5g/L, respectively. OA was detected in 90 (15%) of the 601 samples, but at uniformly low levels, with 85% of positive samples containing less than 0.2 \u00b5g/L OA. Only one sample exceeded 0.5 \u00b5g/L OA and no sample exceeded 1.0 \u00b5g/L OA. No region of Australia appeared more or less likely to produce wines containing OA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16628424769118703135", "cites_id": ["16628424769118703135"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16628424769118703135&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:H46g8TkIxOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
