Following a brief description of some temperate zone mycotoxicoses, this paper looks at tropical problems, in particular liver cancer caused by aflatoxins. The occurrence and toxicology of aflatoxins is outlined. The common sources, taxonomy and physiology of the causal fungi, Aspergillus flavus A. parasiticus, are also described, together with possible techniques removal of aflatoxins from commodities, and assay methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1293399752829700080", "cites_id": ["1293399752829700080"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1293399752829700080&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:8Af-8zgU8xEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1}}
