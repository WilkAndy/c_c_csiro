The influence of three solutes, NaCl, glycerol and a glucose/fructose mixture, was studied at pH 4\u00b70 and pH 6\u00b75 using a plate-slide technique. Germination times and growth rates were affected by solute type, but the influence of pH was less marked. Except for Wallemia sebi, the fungi grew most strongly on glucose/fructose and were partially or completely inhibited by NaCl. The results showed that a universal isolation medium for xerophilic fungi could be based on glycerol or glucose/fructose but not on NaCl as aw-limiting solute."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2421889922313505711", "cites_id": ["2421889922313505711"], "pub_url": "https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-101-1-35", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:r0uYeA1InCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 6, "1987": 2, "1988": 7, "1989": 7, "1990": 7, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 2, "1994": 6, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 8, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 4, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
