A first \nimpression is that there is little or no pattern to the occurrence of particular species, or to the \ntoxins produced by them. However, as a result of recent advances in our under- standing of \nPenicillium taxonomy, knowledge of the ecology of particular species, and of species mycotoxin \nrelationships have improved considerably (ref. 1,2). A definitive list of species known to produce \nsignificant mycotoxins has recently been prepared (ref. 3). This paper reviews the occurrence of \nthe main toxigenic species of Penicillium and the major toxins they may produce in foods and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7200530422837811344", "cites_id": ["7200530422837811344"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/myco1975/1988/1Supplement/1988_1Supplement_159/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kBik_0Rs7WMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1}}
