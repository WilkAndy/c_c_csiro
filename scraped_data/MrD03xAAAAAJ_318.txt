Arguably, the lack of available information in certain regions could indicate that peanut allergies are simply under-reported. However, it could also indicate that peanut allergies are rare in these regions, an idea that has been conveyed in the literature (4). For example, there is a common perception amongst clinicians that peanut allergies are rare in Asia (4). The reported prevalence of peanut allergies in Asia is much lower than that reported in Western countries; whereas many other allergies (milk, egg and shellfish) are far more common (4, 5)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/86929998/article_6879_10415ae2815228954e4351eeb4a89cf3.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
