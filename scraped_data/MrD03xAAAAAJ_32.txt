To confirm which species produce which mycotoxins, representative isolates were investigated for the synthesis of 18 mycotoxins. Isolates were grown on malt extract agar incubated for one to three weeks at 25\u00b0C. Thereafter the medium was extracted with chloroform, and the filtered, concentrated extracts used for mycotoxin analysis by TLC. The production of any particular mycotoxin was confirmed by using external standards in optimal developing systems with toxins visualized by the best visualizing methods. The 18 mycotoxins investigated were produced by one or more Penicillium species, as follows: brevianamid A by 3 species, citreoviridin (2), citrinin (3), cyclopiazonic acid (8), fumitremorgin B (1), griseofulvin (6), luteoskyrin (1), ochratoxin A \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8928196349199234657", "cites_id": ["8928196349199234657"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723202087800085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ybb1pkZT53sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 2, "1989": 6, "1990": 8, "1991": 4, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 2, "1998": 7, "1999": 4, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 5, "2007": 8, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 9, "2015": 11, "2016": 7, "2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 4}}
