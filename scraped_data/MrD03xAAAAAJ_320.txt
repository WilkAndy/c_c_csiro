The case-fatality rates for these four chemicals range from low (eg, peanut allergen) to extremely high (aflatoxin and liver cancer). The effects associated with these four chemicals are neurologic (cyanide in cassava), cancer (aflatoxin), allergic response (peanut allergen), endocrine (dioxin), and reproductive (dioxin)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:Ade32sEp0pkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/258c/464cbd96a07a1b06a60cff51c6b1fba983c8.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ytso65CPgagJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
