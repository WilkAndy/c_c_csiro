Samples of major commodities were obtained from farmers' stocks and middlemen in major producing areas throughout the country. Retail samples were obtained from outlets in and around Bangkok. Samples were divided into two portions, one being examined in Bangkok, and the second in Sydney. After surface disinfection, fungi were enumerated by direct plating on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar, dichloran 18% glycerol agar, Aspergillus flavus and parasiticus agar and dichloran chloramphenicol peptone agar. Figures for percentage infection were calculated, and fungi were isolated and identified to species level. In all 602 samples were examined, and at North Ryde about 18 000 fungal isolates identified. Data obtained from 329 samples are reported here, comprising maize (154), peanuts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 174, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14933784222221081590", "cites_id": ["14933784222221081590"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016816059390166E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9hvSpaB1P88J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 5, "1996": 8, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 10, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 7, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 9, "2008": 15, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 8}}
