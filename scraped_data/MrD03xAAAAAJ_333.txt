In total, 407 coffee samples were examined at different stages: mature (including immature) and overripe cherries from trees, overripe cherries from soil, and beans during drying and during storage on farm. Thirty six soil samples from coffee plantations were also analysed for the presence of ochratoxigenic fungi. The four regions studied were Alta Paulista (western area of Sao Paulo State), Sorocabana (southwest Sao Paulo State), Alta Mogiana (northeast Sao Paulo State) and Cerrado Mineiro (western area of Minas Gerais State), during the coffee harvest seasons of 1999 and 2000. Cherries and beans were surface disinfected with chlorine, plated on Dichloran 18 percent Glycerol Agar at 25\u00c0C for 5-7 days, and analysed for the presence of Aspergillus ochraceus, A. carbonarius and A. niger. The potential for OTA production by fungal isolates was tested by the agar plug technique and by thin layer chromatography. In total, 872 isolates of these three species were taken from coffee samples from the different regions during this study. Although A. niger was the most common species found (549 isolates), only 3 percent produced OTA. A. ochraceus was also commonly occurring (269 isolates), with 75 percent being capable of OTA production. A. carbonarius was found (54 isolates) in only one region, Alta Paulista, which is very hot, and only from beans in the drying yard or in storage. However 77 percent of the A. carbonarius isolates were capable of producing OTA.
