Thailand National Peanut Meeting, Udon Thani (Thailand), 25-27 Oct 1994", "abstract": "A. flavus had been contaminated on stems and petioles since the first two weeks after germination until harvesting time. The infection in both stems and petioles were ranged 1.05-7.24 and 0.84-10.35 percent. The degree of infection at the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks of plant age was not different. A. flavus were also contaminated on peanut leaves, however, the evidence (0.18-7.13 percent) was less than on the other parts. On pegs were first observed in 6 week and the infection was not different between the peg above ground and the one beneath soil. The degree of infection was consequently increased as the plant was getting older. Whenever 8 week, nubs or young pods were found contamination and the weeks later nuts were also contaminated. The nuts however had shown higher contamination than the nubs. Peanut pods during drying processes were generally more fungal contamination compared to fresh pods right after picking. The longer of seed storage period were the higher of A. flavus contamination. In wet season there were 7.75, 8.38, and 11.5 percent at 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively. Similarly trend in dry season, the contamination was 5.42, 5.82, and 7.37 percent at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of storage. Peanut seeds that kept in farmer conditions had relatively high contamination. In addition, A. flavus contamination on peanut seeds in different locations of Thailand was surveyed in 10 provinces during dry season and 13 provinces during wet season. The results showed that in dry season 33.00 percent of 97 preharvested samples 55.82 percent of 163 harvested samples and 61.85 percent of post-harvested samples were contaminated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=TH2000000976", "cites_per_year": {}}
