Samples for major commodities were taken from farmers' stocks, middlemen and retail outlets, while those for minor crops were mostly from retail. Each sample was divided into two portions, one being examined in Bangkok and thesecond at North Ryde. Mycological examinations were carried out by direct plating after surface disinfection in chlorine. Media used were dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar, dichloran 18% glycerol agar, Aspergillus flavus and parasiticus agar and dichloran chloramphenicol peptone agar. Fungi were identified to species level and percentage infection of samples calculated. The dominant fungus found in mung beans was Fusarium semitectum, which was present in 40% of samples and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 173, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18102876027409260914", "cites_id": ["18102876027409260914"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168160594902208", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cuGpctVVOvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 6, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 9, "2009": 7, "2010": 9, "2011": 10, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 6, "2015": 11, "2016": 11, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 8}}
