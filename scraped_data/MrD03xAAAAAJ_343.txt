It is important, therefore, to take this fact into consideration when contemplating isolation and enumeration of the significant microorganisms in the food. If the food is of high aw (0.980\u20130.999), bacteria will be the main spoilage organisms, and media of high aw, such as plate count agar, will be adequate to give an overall picture of the microbiological status of the food.At lower a values (below 0.95), common spoilage bacteria will still be present, but will not be capable of growing in the food and are of less significance. If, however, the food is to be reconstituted to a high a,,, then the presence of pathogens such as Salmonella and Staphylococcus and other foodpoisoning bacteria is significant, and appropriate methods for their detection must be employed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:X0DADzN9RKwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tNhABDqrgw8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA153&dq=info:78zODICx-d4J:scholar.google.com&ots=auQcMIL2sR&sig=-yOAesXt2XnD4rEdzdyf5VoisWQ", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:78zODICx-d4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
