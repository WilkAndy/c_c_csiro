The heat process to which it can be subjected will also be significant. In our recent experience in Australia, most spoilage problems caused by heat resistant molds have originated from passionfruit juice or pulp, though other fruit such as mango and pineapple are also regularly monitored. There have been no reported instances of this type of spoilage from citrus products. Byssochlamys fulva is the most common heat resistant spoilage mold, although Neosartorya fischeri and Talaromyces flavus also caused occasional problems.Where passionfruit juice is to be incorporated into frozen desserts such as ice creams and ice confections, or short-life chilled desserts such as fruit salads, pavlovas, cakes and yogurts, there is no need to set a specification for heat resistant mold spores. A requirement for juice with low yeast counts would be more appropriate. Products which are most at risk from spoilage by heat resistant molds are shelf-stable products which receive a relatively light process (such as conventional or UHT pasteurization) and do not contain preservatives, e. 8., fruit gel baby foods and aseptically packaged, preservative-free fruit juices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2791802906743559031&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:d1Nau_N5viYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
