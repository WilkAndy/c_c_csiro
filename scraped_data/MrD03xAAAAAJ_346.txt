By comparison, the development of media selective for particular fungi remains in its infancy. Nevertheless, selective media are essential for certain classes of fungi such as xerophiles which will not grow on general purpose media. The detection of preservative-resistant yeasts is greatly simplified by using selective media. Other situations in which selective media are of great value are in the isolation of toxigenic fungi belonging to Aspergillus, Fusarium or Penicillium, for example, and increasing efforts can be expected in this area in years to come. The development of selective media for spoilage fungi, such as specific xerophiles or molds invading cereals before harvest, will also be important in the future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8453-3_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IeBN3j8ZpPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
