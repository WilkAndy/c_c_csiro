Unlike bacterial counts, fungal counts may be greatly influenced by contamination with dust or extraneous matter, or degree of sporulation and fragmentation of mycelia, and may not relate directly to actual fungal growth. Nevertheless, food manufacturers are constantly seeking advice on the significance of fungal populations and on the desirability or feasibility of establishing standards for unacceptable counts in foods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8453-3_6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:RbxCxeluVccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
