Prior to the workshop, questionnaires were sent to twenty-five laboratories to determine which media were used for enumeration of fungi in foods. A total of fifteen different media were reported to be routinely used. The media most often used were DRBC, RBC, PDA and OGY. Likewise, recommendations in texts as to the medium of choice for routine culture of foodborne fungi vary widely. Some recommended media are not optimal for enumeration or recovery of fungi from foods, e.g., acidified PDA (APDA). Thus, several scientists were asked to compare the media they routinely used with DRBC, DG18 or OGY. The following papers report the results of these studies and others describing media for general purpose enumeration and isolation of fungi from foods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8453-3_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-K5V_DSzm6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
