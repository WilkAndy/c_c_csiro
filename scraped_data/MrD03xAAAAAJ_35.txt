This is controlled by good farm management practice, segregation into grades on aflatoxin content at intake to shelling facilities, colour sorting and aflatoxin assays. A second problem is the potential presence of ochratoxin A in grapes and grape products, resulting from infection by Aspergillus carbonarius. Good quality control before and during wine making ensures ochratoxin A is kept to very low levels, but in dried vine fruit, ochratoxin A levels may be higher. Biocontrol by competitive exclusion has been developed as the most promising means of controlling aflatoxins in peanuts. Some details of the process are given, including some basic laboratory experiments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6040807138952053327", "cites_id": ["6040807138952053327"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11046-006-0059-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:T4LhWRZC1VMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 10, "2011": 15, "2012": 7, "2013": 12, "2014": 11, "2015": 14, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 10, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 18, "2022": 12}}
