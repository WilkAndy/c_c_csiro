Consensus on the cocept of an Aspergillus species appears to be in reach. The major unsolved problem in Aspergillus taxonomy, curiously enough, is typification. This problem arises because the principal monographers of the genus during the past 50 years, C. Thom, KB Raper and DI Fennell, have failed to typify their accepted species, and indeed a close examination of their works will show a lack of stability in some of their species concepts over that period. This problem area has recently been addressed for the important toxigenic species A. flavus and A. parasiticus by Kozakiewicz (Mycotoaxon 15: 293-305, 1982). In his paper on Aspergillus, Dr DT Wicklow addressed ecological aspects of Aspergillus taxonomy, specifically the relationship of A. flavus and A. parasiticus"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15006330653223680269&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
