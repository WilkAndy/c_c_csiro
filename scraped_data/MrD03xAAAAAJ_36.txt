Media were prepared over a wide range of water activity (aw) from 0.996 to 0.75, controlled by a mixture of glucose and fructose. Water relations of A. flavus, A. oryzae and A. parasiticus were very similar. The minimum aw for germination and growth of each of these three species was 0.82 at 25\u00b0C, 0.81 at 30\u00b0C and 0.80 at 37\u00b0C. A. nomius was slightly less xerophilic, with minimum aw values for germination and growth of 0.83 at 25 and 30\u00b0C, and 0.81 at 37\u00b0C. Reported differences in water relations between A. flavus and A. parasiticus were not substantiated. The \u201cdomestication\u201d of A. oryzae has not affected its water relations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8586930208484700268", "cites_id": ["8586930208484700268"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8586930208484700268&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bDDNc4fnKncJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 2, "2001": 6, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 9, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 13, "2013": 11, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 12, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
