Let me make it clear that the word I wish to stress here is\" government\".When trying to justify government expendi-ture on a planting project, or the treating of natural regeneration, are we being wise in mentioning the question of interest on the expenditure during the initial stages? If calculations are carried out at compound interest using Faust-mann's equation the project might well be shown to be uneconomic, at present day values for the estimated yield. But who can say what the value of the yield will be when the area comes to be exploited?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9402650556952164145&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MTdDOt3sfIIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
