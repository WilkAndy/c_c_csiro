The literature on Penicillium mycotoxins, and the species producing them, includes contributions from many sources. This chapter provides a summary of knowledge on significant Penicillium mycotoxins and the species producing them. Citreoviridin is also produced by Eupenicillium ochrosalmoneum, which is a relatively uncommon, though widespread species usually associated with cereals. Ochratoxin A (OA) is the most important toxin produced by a Penicillium species. OA was originally described as a metabolite of Aspergillus ochraceus. Patulin was once considered to be a relatively important mycotoxi, but early reports of carcinogenicity have not been substantiated. The most important Penicillium species producing patulin is P. expansum, best known as a fruit pathogen, but \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1695581878949061954&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
