With the aid of government and industrial funding, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIR 0), Division of Food Research has carried out an ongoing project for most of this period, with emphasis on studies under commercial field conditions. Research has been primarily concerned with understanding the variables that influence the invasion of groundnuts by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, and the subsequent production of aflatoxins. Factors studied include: levels of A. flavus in soils, environmental factors; farm management practices affecting A. flavus invasion; and the influence of drying and storage procedures on aflatoxin development.Most groundnut soils in Kingaroy have been found to contain detectable levels of A. flavus, while surrounding virgin soils usually do not. LeveI... of A. flavus in groundnut soils v8JY widely, from less than I 02 spores g-1 to as high as I 05 spores gl; high levels are much more likely to lead to invasion. Some fields contained consistently high levels over several years. The A. flavus/A. parasiticus ratio also varies widely from farm to farm, and may influence invasion and toxin production."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://oar.icrisat.org/502/1/RA_00132.pdf#page=231", "cites_per_year": {}}
