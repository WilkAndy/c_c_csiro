The modern literature is cluttered with examples of species purported to make particular mycotoxins, but where the association is incorrect. In some cases, mycotoxins have even been named based on an erroneous association with a particular species: verruculogen, viridicatumtoxin and rubratoxin come to mind. As time has gone on, and more and more compounds have been described, lists of species-mycotoxin associations have become so large, and the inaccuracies in them so widespread in acceptance, that determining true associations has become very difficult. It does not need to be emphasised how important it is that these associations be known accurately. The possible presence of mycotoxigenic fungi in foods, and rational decisions on the status of foods suspected to contain mycotoxins, are ever present problems in the food industry around the world."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BvSSDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:kfwWLuza4WEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=akobVXgaCe&sig=Zu_I2GkTB5NiJd5zN9JX9GyCono", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kfwWLuza4WEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
