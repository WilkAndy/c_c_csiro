The medium, designated DCPA, was shown to select against species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and mucoraceous fungi. DCPA was evaluated for use as an enumeration medium and compared satisfactorily with dichloran-rose bengal-chloramphenicol agar when both media were tested with a range of cereal samples. Fusarium species and dematiaceous hyphomycetes produced well-formed colonies with good conidial production on DCPA, permitting rapid identification of such isolates on this medium."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 165, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12926010329124879413", "cites_id": ["12926010329124879413"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.51.6.1235-1238.1986", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NbyEzuhpYrMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 5, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 9, "1996": 5, "1997": 8, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 6, "2008": 3, "2009": 10, "2010": 9, "2011": 8, "2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
