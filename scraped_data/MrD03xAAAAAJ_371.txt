Thirty-three isolates of P. ulaiense were collected from decaying citrus fruits found in seven citrus-growing areas of the world. Two isolates were collected in California in 1987, and the remainder were collected in 1992 and 1993 (Table 1). The Taiwan type P ulaiense (isolate 1640) was collected from a rotting orange along a roadside in Ulai, Taiwan, and was kindly provided by S.-S. Tzean of the Department of Plant Pathology and Entomology, National Taiwan University, Taipei. All isolates were taken from stock cultures maintained for longterm storage on silica gel (19) at 3 C and transferred to slants of potato-dextrose agar (PDA) to prepare inoculum for the various tests. Taxonomy. The description and classification of P. ulaiense followed the methodology of Pitt (20) and are based on ex-aminations of 34 isolates listed in Table 1.
