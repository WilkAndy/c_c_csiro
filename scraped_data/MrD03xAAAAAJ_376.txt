Fungi producing significant mycotoxins", "citation": "", "author": "John Pitt", "abstract": "Mycotoxins have been defined as \u2018fungal metabolites which when ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin cause lowered performance, sickness or death in man or animals, including birds\u2019(Pitt, 1996). This definition appears to be accepted widely, though interpretation of \u201canimals\u201d is still under discussion in some quarters. The definition as it stands may be taken as including lower, invertebrate, animals, and as it seems likely that some mycotoxins are indeed aimed at insects, such as the mites which prey on fungi, this interpretation is reasonable. However, most mycotoxicologists consider that mycotoxins are of relevance only when they affect man and domesticated animals, and this much narrower definition will be used here.Many thousands of fungal metabolites have been described; even the large number dealt with in a recent review (Cole et al., 2003) are only a fraction of those known.
