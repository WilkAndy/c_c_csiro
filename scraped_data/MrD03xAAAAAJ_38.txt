These are large and ublquitous genera; several species are beneficial to mankind because of their role in food fermentation or the production of useful antibiotics and enzymes. Others are important as agents of food spoilage. In recent years, these moulds have galned attention because a number of species produce toxic metabolites. The great impact of mycotoxicology on food problems, particularly in developing countries has generated a vast body of research. The ecological roles of Aspergillus and Penicillium species in nature is also of importance.For the past several decades, the taxonomic treatments of Raper and Thom (1949) and Raper and Fennell (1965) were the only standard descriptive monographs of Penicillium and Asper-gillus. However, in practice, the identification of these economically important moulds was problematic and caused considerable confusion in the literature and subsequently in applied research. In the past ten years, several laboratories have carried out taxonomic research resulting in a number of valuable publications. However, the differences in methodology and species concepts made comparison between the diffe-rent classifications difficult. This confusion in the taxo-nomy and nomenclature of common species is a great handicap to applied and industrial research. While we do not suggest that a consensus on the classification of these genera will solve all industrial and agricultural problems, such a step forward would, indeed, be progress in this direction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 164, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11651453937748030317", "cites_id": ["11651453937748030317"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=TKfxBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA4&dq=info:bTNM1J9HsqEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=UiFDA2xQ1K&sig=quc-NHyCkaltKhOMPmukSKhSEmo", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bTNM1J9HsqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 4, "1989": 4, "1990": 7, "1991": 4, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 7, "1995": 4, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 7, "2001": 2, "2002": 10, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 10, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 9, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 6}}
