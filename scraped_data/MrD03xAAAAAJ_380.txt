With the exception of oxaloacetate reductase, the enzymes required for the proposed pathway were constitutive. Enzyme activity changes during the course of citrate utilization and activity changes when acetate, acetyl phosphate, malate, and fumarate were added as electron acceptors were consistent with the proposed pathway. Acetate, malate and fumarate were found to accumulate in the medium during citrate degradation and then disappear as succinate, and ethanol accumulated, demonstrating that they were intermediates in the pathway of citrate utilization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=770441606794690260&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1L4tNY8osQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
