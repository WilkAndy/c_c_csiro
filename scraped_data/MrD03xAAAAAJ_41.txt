This definition is widely accepted, although interpretation of \u201canimals\u201d is still under discussion in some quarters. The definition as it stands may be taken as including lower (invertebrate) animals; as it seems likely that some mycotoxins are indeed aimed at insects, such as the mites that prey on fungi, this interpretation is reasonable. However, most mycotoxicologists consider that mycotoxins are of relevance only when they affect humans and domestic animals, and this much narrower definition is used here. It has been known for a long time that it is hazardous to eat some species of the larger fungi, ie mushrooms and \u201ctoadstools\u201d, but until comparatively recently the occurrence of common moulds on foods has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14800450787033895571", "cites_id": ["14800450787033895571"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Miller-6/publication/322231661_Improving_public_health_through_mycotoxin_control/links/5a4ced94a6fdcc3e99d13160/Improving-public-health-through-mycotoxin-control.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:k1LOHJPDZc0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 12, "2015": 11, "2016": 8, "2017": 12, "2018": 15, "2019": 19, "2020": 25, "2021": 25, "2022": 21, "2023": 6}}
