Comprehensive surveys of Australian wines have determined that the frequency and level of OTA contamination are low. Aspergillus carbonarius is the primary OTA-producing species associated with grapes in Australia, and all isolates tested to date produce OTA. Aspergillus niger is isolated more frequently from vineyards, however, few strains produce OTA. A. carbonarius and A. niger exist as saprophytes in the top layer of soil beneath vines, from where they are thought to be blown onto bunches. The level of A. carbonarius in soil may be reduced by temperatures above or below the optimum temperature for survival (25 \u00b0C), by high soil moisture content, and by modifications to tillage and mulching practices. A. carbonarius is an opportunistic pathogen of damaged berries. In the absence of damage, spores may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 149, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8853949956817981817", "cites_id": ["8853949956817981817"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160506001966", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:eZE4U5OM33oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 10, "2008": 21, "2009": 12, "2010": 13, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 11, "2014": 12, "2015": 10, "2016": 9, "2017": 9, "2018": 7, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
