Members of Aspergillus section Nigri were enumerated and identified in a total of 806 samples comprising both fresh fruit as well as partially\u2010dried and fully\u2010dried grapes. Aspergillus aculeatus, A. carbonarius and A. niger were commonly isolated. Of those three species, A. niger showed the highest optimum temperature for growth, as well as highest thermal tolerance. That combination of properties probably accounts for the occurrence of A. niger in over 80% of fruit samples in all three seasons. A. carbonarius was also prevalent on fruit surveyed for fungal rots. Severity of infection with this group of fungi was highest in the seasons when grape berries were rain\u2010damaged. Typically, the Aspergillus count \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 138, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1720931170197747495", "cites_id": ["1720931170197747495"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2004.tb00010.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J7eICsj54RcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 21, "2007": 17, "2008": 6, "2009": 9, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 9, "2015": 12, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
