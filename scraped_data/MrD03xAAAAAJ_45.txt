Penicillium were examined by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isolates which gave similar pectic zymograms were grouped; amylase and ribonuclease zymograms produced groupings consistent with these. Groups corresponding to accepted species were: P. arenicola, P. atramentosum, P. brevicompactum, P. crustosum, P. digitatum, P. echinulatum, P. expansum (including P. resticulosum), P. fennelliae, P. granulatum, P. griseofulvum, P. griseoroseum (including P. chrysogenum), P. hirsutum, P. italicum, P. olsonii, P. roquefortii and P. verrucosum. Some closely related species including P. aurantiogriseum and P. viridicatum were divisible into several enzymatically distinct groups which did not correspond well with accepted morphological species.
