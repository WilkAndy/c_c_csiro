In this review we briefly discuss the distribution of toxigenic Aspergillus species in nuts, coffee and cocoa beans, dried fruits, grapes, maize, rice and small grains. Future perspectives of distribution of Aspergillus species in foods are briefly discussed taking into account the impacts of climate change and the resilience of these mycotoxigenic species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18277869993611387118", "cites_id": ["18277869993611387118"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799317302047", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:7mD6O-sJqP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 19, "2020": 28, "2021": 30, "2022": 34, "2023": 12}}
