Thus, an alternate hypothesis, namely a very broad concept of the genus Fusarium was proposed. In doing so, however, a significant body of data that supports distinct genera in Nectriaceae based on morphology, biology, and phylogeny is disregarded. A DNA phylogeny based on 19 orthologous protein-coding genes was presented to support a very broad concept of Fusarium at the F1 node in Nectriaceae. Here, we demonstrate that re-analyses of this dataset show that all 19 genes support the F3 node that represents Fusarium sensu stricto as defined by F. sambucinum (sexual morph synonym Gibberella pulicaris). The backbone of the phylogeny is resolved by the concatenated alignment, but only six of the 19 genes fully support \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:nPT8s1NX_-sC", "num_citations": 117, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3979047427944881096", "cites_id": ["3979047427944881096"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166061621000038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yBsWx41qODcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 17, "2022": 55, "2023": 44}}
