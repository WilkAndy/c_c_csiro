At that time, the Committee recommended that further studies be conducted to elucidate the role of ochratoxin A (and other mycotoxins) in causing nephropathy in pigs and humans, the mechanisms of induction of tumours, and the role of phenylalanine in antagonizing the adverse effects of ochratoxin A.(The present Committee noted that the adverse effects noted at the thirty-seventh meeting consisted of nephrotoxicity.) Ochratoxin A was re-evaluated by the Committee at its forty-fourth meeting (Annex 1, reference 116), when it considered toxicological data that had become \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14241441419433190600", "cites_id": ["14241441419433190600"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14241441419433190600&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yKTZPoTDo8UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 6, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 9, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 8, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
