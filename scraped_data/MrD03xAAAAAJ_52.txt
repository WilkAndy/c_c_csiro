Eight isolates were grown on media with water activity (aw) controlled by NaCl, glycerol or a glucose/fructose mixture. As the differences in effects caused by the various solutes were slight, the other eighteen were grown on glycerol based media only. Minimum water activities permitting germination differed widely, from 0.90 for P. digitatum (Pers. ex Fr.) Sacc. and P. funiculosum Thorn to 0.78 for P. brevicompactum Dierckx, P. implicatum Biourge, P. janczewskii Zaleski and P. phoeniceum van Beyma. Data on the influence of water activity on radial growth are also provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 114, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18301758938381283812", "cites_id": ["18301758938381283812"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007153679800844", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:5PELn8no_P0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 4, "1984": 2, "1985": 1, "1986": 5, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 4, "1990": 1, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
