Production of aflatoxin by A. flavus, patulin by B. nivea and roquefortine C by P. roqueforti was also studied. Fungal growth was evaluated under atmospheres consisting of 20, 40 and 60% CO2 plus <0.5% O2, on two media, Czapek Yeast Extract agar and Potato Dextrose agar. Several methods for measuring fungal growth were used: colony diameter, ergosterol content, hyphal length and/or mycelium dry weight. Among the nine species, three groups were distinguished with respect to their growth responses under modified atmospheres: (i) species which did not grow in 20% CO2 <0.5% O2 (P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1073348631722749050", "cites_id": ["1073348631722749050"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160509002189", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:emz8yeRM5Q4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 9, "2013": 6, "2014": 3, "2015": 13, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 8, "2019": 12, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
