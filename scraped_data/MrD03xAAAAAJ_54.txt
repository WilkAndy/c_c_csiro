EARLY STUDIES As far back as 1913, Alsberg and Black'reported that a Penicillium isolated from moldy corn in Nebraska could produce a principle which was toxic to animals when injected at levels of 200 to 300 mg/kg body weight. The species was identified as P. puberulum Bainier, and the toxic compound they named penicillic acid. This was the first reliable account of toxin production by a Penicillium species or, indeed, by any hyphomycetous fungus. Their study, which aimed to resolve the question as to whether common fungi, or fungal products, could have an injurious effect on animals, was carefully carried out and was far ahead of its time. However, the world was not then ready for such direct evidence that metabolites produced by common fungi could be toxic, and the work was largely ignored. Miyake et al., 2 in Japan, published a study 30 years later on a species they called P. toxicarium Miyake. The fungus produced a highly toxic metabolite, subsequently named citreoviridin. Perhaps because results of the study were published during wartime, this work also failed to alert the world to potential or actual mammalian toxicity of Penicillia and other common hyphomycetes. The discovery of penicillin in 1929 gave impetus to a search for other Penicillium metabolites with antibiotic properties and, ultimately, to the recognition of citrinin, patulin, and griseofulvin as\" toxic antibiotics\" or, later, mycotoxins. 3-5 The discovery of aflatoxins in 1960 finally achieved a general awareness of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins. Now, by the 1990s, the literature on toxigenic Penicillium species has become quite vast.
