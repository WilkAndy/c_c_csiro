Washington, DC, US, American Public Health Association", "pages": "251-263", "abstract": "Heat-resistant filamentous fungi (ie, molds) are a group of organisms that are characterized by their ability to survive high temperatures applied during heat treatment, thereby causing severe economical losses. 7 Their ability to survive these high temperatures is because of the formation of ascospores or other heat-resistant mold structures (Table 22.1). Ascospores are dormant and need an external trigger (ie, activation) to start germinating. In the food industry, this external trigger is often a pasteurization step; however, other processes such as high-pressure treatments or pulsed electric fields can activate ascospores. 38, 8, 10, 37 The germination of ascospores may result in mycelium formation on or in the food product and cause spoilage. Production of pectinolytic enzymes can result in the complete breakdown of texture in fruits and can cause the development of off-flavors. 35 Growth of heat-resistant molds can be slow and is often visible after the products are in the market. This slow growth is influenced by additional factors such as low oxygen concentrations in bottles of fruit juices. Heatresistant molds are able to produce several mycotoxins; however, this is often less important because mold spoilage in end products is visible and these products are unlikely to be consumed. Spoilage of thermally processed products by heat-resistant molds is a worldwide phenomenon. Species belonging to the genera Byssochlamys, Neosartorya, and Talaromyces have been most frequently encountered, and ascospore-forming members of the genera Penicillium (syn. Eupenicillium), Hamigera, and Monascus are less commonly encountered. 3, 9, 11, 12 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 107, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10363645872330566988,6247460214031792236", "cites_id": ["10363645872330566988", "6247460214031792236"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emilia-Rico/publication/310426031_Detection_and_Enumeration_of_Heat-Resistant_Molds/links/620abf3d634ff774f4ce4fa5/Detection-and-Enumeration-of-Heat-Resistant-Molds.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:TO00DgMR048J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 8}}
