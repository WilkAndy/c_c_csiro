Both species can produce aflatoxins, but not all isolates of either species do so. We examined the genetic relationship between toxigenic and non-toxigenic isolates using RAPD and Neighbour Joining analysis. Twenty-four RAPD amplifications using a combination of 17 primers discriminated between 20 isolates of A. flavus and 15 isolates of A. parasiticus. A. flavus isolates divided into two distinct groups with both toxigenic and non-toxigenic isolates occurring in each group. No association was seen between RAPD genotype and the ability to produce toxin. Five non-toxigenic isolates of A. parasiticus separated into two groups, in which the isolates were similar but not identical. These groups of non-toxigenic isolates occurred on branches in which toxigenic isolates also occurred.
