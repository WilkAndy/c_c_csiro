It is grown mainly in West Africa although significant quantities also come from Asia and Central and South America. Primary processing is carried out on the farm, and the flavour of chocolate starts to develop at that time. Freshly harvested pods are opened, the beans, piled in heaps or wooden boxes, are fermented naturally by yeasts and bacteria, then dried in the sun on wooden platforms or sometimes on cement or on the ground, where a gradual reduction in moisture content inhibits microbial growth. Beans are then bagged and marketed. In processing plants, the dried fermented beans are roasted, shelled and ground, then two distinct processes are used, to produce powdered cocoa or chocolate. Filamentous fungi may contaminate many stages in cocoa processing, and poor practices may have a strong influence on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5129111086720348558", "cites_id": ["5129111086720348558"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016816051400110X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jvF7sVtDLkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 11, "2018": 16, "2019": 19, "2020": 7, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 5}}
