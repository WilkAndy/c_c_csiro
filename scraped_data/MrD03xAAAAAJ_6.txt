The most important mycotoxins are aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, trichothecenes and zearalenone. Aflatoxins are potent carcinogens and, in association with hepatitis B virus, are responsible for many thousands of human deaths per annum, mostly in non-industrialised tropical countries. Ochratoxin A is a probable carcinogen, and may cause urinary tract cancer and kideny damage in people from northern and eastern Europe. Fumonisins appear to be the cause of oesophagel cancer in southern Africa, parts of China and elsewhere. Trichothecenes are highly immunosuppressive and zearalenone causes oestrogenic effects in animals and man.
