Three species, B. halophila, P. pisce and Ex. werneckii, grew more rapidly on media containing NaCl in comparison with glucose/fructose, and hence can be considered to be halophilic. Two other species, A. penicilloides and A, wentii, were also unusually tolerant of NaCl: A. penicilloides could grow on media saturated with NaCl, while A. wentii grew more rapidly on NaCl-based media down to 0\u00b782a w than any other xerophile examined so far. In contrast, the Geomyces sp. was intolerant of salt.
