It is concluded that P. puberulum, as neotypified by Pitt in his 1979 monograph, is a synonym of P. aurantiogriseum. The correct name for saprophytic Penicillia producing cyclopiazonic acid is P. commune with P. palitans as a synonym. The moulds used in the manufacture of white cheeses, which are all classified in P. camembertii, and which also produce cyclopiazonic acid, are domesticated fungi derived from P. commune."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12871130741059062319", "cites_id": ["12871130741059062319"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0740002086900225", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:L4pv_jZxn7IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
