Chemicals are responsible for flavour when they are present in a foodstuff above a limiting concentration-the threshold concentration (TC)-and the intensity of the flavour can be represented by the ratio of the actual concentration in the foodstuff to the threshold concentration in that foodstuff-sometimes called an bdour unit'or'flavour unit'(Guadagni et al. 1966). The TC of a chemical will be different in various foodstuffs which have different proportions of fat, water and protein. It is necessary to remember that an off-"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3236741514333371074", "cites_id": ["3236741514333371074"], "pub_url": "https://alumni.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Vol-44-No-4-1984.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:wrqZH0I36ywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 3, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 5, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
