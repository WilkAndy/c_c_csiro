Compound 1 has previously been synthesised but only partially characterised. Methylation of 1 using diazomethane afforded the crystalline compound 2,8-dimethoxy-6-methyl-9-oxo-9H-xanthene-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester (3), whose structure was determined by single crystal X-ray analysis. This paper reports the full spectroscopic characterisation of compounds 1\u20133 by NMR, UV, IR and MS data. All compounds were inactive in a brine shrimp lethality assay and several antimicrobial screens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14254007317818683018", "cites_id": ["14254007317818683018"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942204003577", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iq5mdCJo0MUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 8, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 9, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 5}}
