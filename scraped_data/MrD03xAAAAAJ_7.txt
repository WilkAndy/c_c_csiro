Meeting and Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives and World Health Organization", "volume": "61", "publisher": "World Health Organization", "abstract": "This report represents the conclusions of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives, with a view to recommending acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and to prepare specifications for the identity and purity of food additives. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation of food additives (including flavoring agents) and contaminants, assessments of intake, and the establishment and revision of specifications for food additives. A summary follows of the Committee's evaluations of toxicological and intake data on various specific food additives (A-amylase from Bacillus lichenformis containing a genetically engineered A-amylase gene from B. Licheniformis, annatto extracts, curcumin, diacetyl and fatty acid esters of glycerol, D-tagatose, laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, mixed xylanase, B-glucanase enzyme preparation produced by a strain of Humicola insolens, neotame, polyvinyl alcohol, quillaia extracts and xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus expressed in Fusarium venenatum), flavouring agents, a nutritional source of iron (ferrous glycinate, processed with citric acid), a disinfectant for drinking-water (sodium dichloroisocyanurate) and contaminants (cadmium and methylmercury). Annexed to the report are tables summarizing the Committee's recommendations for ADIs of the food additives, recommendations on the flavouring agents considered, and tolerable intakes of the contaminants considered, changes in the status of specifications and further information requested or desired."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C", "num_citations": 532, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10216764403041891337,8423855528594371190,1481184804710422750,15674267203521158757,4099808949891905034,2546218251950705910,7046072089940793410,17154225907767329864,16438657328835467689,11501495016856289611,6187266130397677635,2349265323677854480", "cites_id": ["10216764403041891337", "8423855528594371190", "1481184804710422750", "15674267203521158757", "4099808949891905034", "2546218251950705910", "7046072089940793410", "17154225907767329864", "16438657328835467689", "11501495016856289611", "6187266130397677635", "2349265323677854480"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=K7OaG7wzwtAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:CfQqBRg9yY0J:scholar.google.com&ots=lT-IUk-qWY&sig=BtpY-n_dljUt8WilHA-OXcmodog", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CfQqBRg9yY0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 9, "2007": 3, "2008": 12, "2009": 13, "2010": 20, "2011": 16, "2012": 18, "2013": 24, "2014": 24, "2015": 29, "2016": 32, "2017": 38, "2018": 45, "2019": 49, "2020": 45, "2021": 48, "2022": 52, "2023": 25}}
