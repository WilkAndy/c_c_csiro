Production of aflatoxin by A. flavus, patulin by B. nivea, roquefortine C by P. roqueforti, and cyclopiazonic acid by P. commune was also studied. Fungal growth was evaluated by three methods: colony diameter, hyphal length or mycelium dry weight and ergosterol content. Among the nine fungal species examined, two E. chevalieri and X. bisporus, did not grow under these conditions. In this study, fungi differed in their response to modified atmospheres in biomass, ergosterol content, mycotoxin production and morphology. Reductions of 57.8\u201396.9%, 73.7\u201399.6% and 91.5\u201399.9% were obtained in colony diameter, hyphal length and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15835395282817441641", "cites_id": ["15835395282817441641"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160510005027", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ad86NhygwtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
