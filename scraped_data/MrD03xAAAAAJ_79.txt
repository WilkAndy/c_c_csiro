Ascospores are acicular and 2 per ascus, characteristic of the genus Metschnikowia. On the basis of 2 distinct ascus shapes, 2 new species are described, M. pulchcrrima and M. reukaufii. Zygote formation occurs after mixing haploid cultures derived from M. zobellii and the above Candida and Chlamydozyma species. Taxonomic implications are considered, and Chlamydozyma is concluded to be an illegitimate name.The complete life cycles of these yeasts are presented. Germinating ascospores give rise to heterothallic haploid cultures, which on mating form zygotes, then diploid vegetative cells, and chlamydospores. Chlamy- dospores may differentiate to form asci, or revert to vegetative cells by budding.Details are given of the methods with which sporulation was induced.
