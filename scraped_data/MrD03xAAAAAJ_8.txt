Thirty-one antifungal compounds were surveyed for their ability to selectively inhibit such fungi while allowing growth of mycotoxigenic molds and other species of significance in food spoilage. Dichloran (2,6 dichloro-4-nitroaniline) restricted growth of Rhizopus stolonifer while allowing satisfactory growth of the other test molds. Three Rhizopus and Mucor species were encountered that were not inhibited by dichloran; these were controlled by the addition of rose bengal. The optimal medium, designated DRBC, contained 2 micrograms of dichloran and 25 micrograms of rose bengal per ml. DRBC, in pure culture tests and with food samples, restricted the colony size of spreading molds and recovered a wider range of species in higher numbers than other enumeration media."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 518, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2506691856695851525", "cites_id": ["2506691856695851525"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/aem.37.5.959-964.1979", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:BXq4b_aOySIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 5, "1985": 5, "1986": 12, "1987": 9, "1988": 4, "1989": 2, "1990": 6, "1991": 10, "1992": 9, "1993": 13, "1994": 12, "1995": 21, "1996": 13, "1997": 8, "1998": 7, "1999": 6, "2000": 10, "2001": 13, "2002": 8, "2003": 15, "2004": 11, "2005": 9, "2006": 15, "2007": 17, "2008": 15, "2009": 16, "2010": 12, "2011": 14, "2012": 20, "2013": 33, "2014": 23, "2015": 18, "2016": 14, "2017": 22, "2018": 23, "2019": 17, "2020": 11, "2021": 14, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
