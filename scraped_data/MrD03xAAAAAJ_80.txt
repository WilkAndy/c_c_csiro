A total of 364 isolates from 74 fish were cultured and identified. The most prevalent fungus was a previously undescribed species, now named Polypaecilum pisce, which was isolated from 42% of the fish examined, in extreme cases appearing as conspicuous white growth over large areas of the fish surface. Other frequently isolated species were Eurotium rubrum (35%), E. repens (26%), E. amstelodami (22%), E. chevalieri (18%), Aspergillus niger (37%), A. flavus (27%), A. sydowii (23%), A. penicilloides (16%) and A. wentii (15%). A variety of Penicillium species and species from 17 other genera were isolated less frequently."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5538056171612888427", "cites_id": ["5538056171612888427"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0740002086900201", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:a10lB78g20wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 5, "1989": 0, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
