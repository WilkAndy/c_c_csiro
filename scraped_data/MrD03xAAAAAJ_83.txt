A new, more comprehensive description of the fungus and related taxonomic information are given. This description is based on examinations of the type isolate and 33 other isolates from citrus fruits in seven citrus-growing areas of the world. P. ulaiense was confirmed unique from P. italicum, the cause of citrus blue mold, by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction analysis and morpho-logical criteria. P. ulaiense, P. italicum, and P. digitatum (the cause of citrus green mold) showed similar temperature-growth relationships, but P. ulaiense grew more slowly. P. ulaiense was pathogenic but only mod-erately virulent to commercial varieties of citrus. P. italicum and P. digitatum formed lesions 80 mm in diameter on lemons and oranges three to five times faster than did P. ulaiense.
