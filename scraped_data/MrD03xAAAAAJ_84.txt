Systemic infections may become established. The fungi can spread throughout the plants, though prevalence is higher in parts nearer the soil. Aspergillus flavus is more invasive than A. parasiticus under these conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13792720644833993384", "cites_id": ["13792720644833993384"], "pub_url": "https://ami-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-765X.1991.tb00558.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qOKGeVmWab8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
