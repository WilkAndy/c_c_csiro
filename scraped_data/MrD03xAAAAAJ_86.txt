Really dry foods, i.e. of a safe aw, may be impossible to obtain for climatic or economic reasons, or be unacceptable to the consumer; a sufficient heat process may destroy desirable flavours; and permitted preservative levels are set by law. Some fungi, by virtue of specific attributes, simply cannot be processed out of certain types of foods. Of particular importance are Xeromyces bisporus and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii \u2013 extreme xerophiles which grow in concentrated foods; Byssochlamys spp., Talaromyces spp. and Neosartorya fischeri with ascospores of very high heat resistance which can survive heat processing and may grow in heat processed acid foods; and Zygosaccharomyces bailii, a preservative resistant yeast. Making foods safe from these fungi requires that they be absent from raw materials or destroyed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6616366778005562363", "cites_id": ["6616366778005562363"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85640-3_12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-6O3kocO0lsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 7, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
