A total of 187 rice samples, from field, processing and market from two different production systems, wetland from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, dryland, from the state of Maranh\u00e3o and market samples from the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, were analyzed for fungi belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi and the presence of aflatoxins. Twenty-three soil samples from wetland and dryland were also analyzed. A total of 383 Aspergillus section Flavi strains were isolated from rice and soil samples. Using a polyphasic approach, with phenotypic (morphology and extrolite profiles) and molecular data (beta-tubulin gene sequences), five species were identified: A. flavus, A. caelatus, A. novoparasiticus, A. arachidicola and A. pseudocaelatus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18407253197917539949", "cites_id": ["18407253197917539949"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160517305275", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bU6M-EGzc_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 12, "2020": 18, "2021": 13, "2022": 13, "2023": 2}}
