Samples were obtained from fields at harvest, from middle men and from retail outlets in the western highlands around Bogor, and the southern plains around Yogyakarta. Samples were divided, one portion being examined in Indonesian institutions and the second at CSIRO Division of Food Science and Technology (now Food Science Australia). After surface disinfection, fungi were enumerated by direct plating on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar, dichloran 18% glycerol agar, Aspergillus flavus and parasiticus agar, and dichloran chloramphenicol peptone agar. Fungi were isolated and identified to species level, and figures for percentage infection calculated. In all 675 samples were examined, comprising peanuts (256), maize (82), kemiri (candle) nuts (19), paddy rice (35), milled rice \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11186443682492912899", "cites_id": ["11186443682492912899"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Pitt/publication/288218725_The_mycoflora_of_food_commodities_from_Indonesia/links/5689bb7408ae051f9af78403/The-mycoflora-of-food-commodities-from-Indonesia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AxXnykI7PpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
