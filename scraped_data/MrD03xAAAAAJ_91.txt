An analytical method for fumonisins from liquid media was developed after evaluation of five solid phase extraction minicolumns under various conditions. Strains isolated mainly from maize from Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand produced fusarins A, C and F as well as fumonisins B1, and B2. Among the strains, the ratio of fusarins to fumonisins production varied considerably indicating a genetic difference between strains. This is the first report of fumonisins B1, and B2 from F. moniliforme from all three countries. Fusarins are reported for the first time from strains from Indonesia and the Philippines."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15646600996131078153", "cites_id": ["15646600996131078153"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00275514.1993.12026290", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:CYCq7LTkI9kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 5, "1996": 11, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
