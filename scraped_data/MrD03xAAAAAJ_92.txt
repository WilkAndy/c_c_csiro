Samples were analysed for: percentages of aflatoxigenic fungal species and potential for aflatoxin production and presence of aflatoxins. Aspergillusnomius was the most common species found (1235 isolates) which amounted to 30% of the total species with potential to produce aflatoxins. This species is of concern since 100% of all isolates produced aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aspergillusflavus was almost equally common (1212 isolates) although only 46% produced aflatoxins under laboratory conditions, and only aflatoxins B1 and B2. Low number of other species with the potential to produce aflatoxins was isolated: Aspergillusarachidicola and Aspergillus bombycis produced B and G aflatoxins whilst Aspergilluspseudotamarii \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3296970526639262784", "cites_id": ["3296970526639262784"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160512005661", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:QAxE0zkxwS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 9, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
