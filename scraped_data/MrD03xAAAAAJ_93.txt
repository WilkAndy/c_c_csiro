The study sampled predominantly bottled wines, approximately equal numbers of red and white wines, wines made from a range of grape varieties and wines from all the major producing areas and some of the minor ones. A validated HPLC assay that did not utilise expensive immunoaffinity columns was developed for quantifying OA in wine, with limits of detection and quantification of 0.02 and 0.05 \u03bcg/L respectively. OA was detected in 90 (15.0%) of the 601 samples, but at uniformly low levels, with 85% of positive samples containing less than 0.2 \u03bcg/L OA. Only one sample exceeded 0.5 \u03bcg/L OA and no sample exceeded 1.0 \u03bcg/L OA. No region of Australia appeared more or less likely to produce wines containing OA."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11750278812672039365", "cites_id": ["11750278812672039365"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2003.tb00234.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xZkdEVNgEaMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 7, "2008": 3, "2009": 8, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
