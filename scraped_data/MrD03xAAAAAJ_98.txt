It is important therefore to have reliable, convenient methods for measuring fungal growth. However, the growth of fungi is not easy to quantify because, unlike bacteria and yeasts, fungi do not grow as single cells, but as hyphal filaments that cannot be quantified by the usual enumeration techniques. Fungal hyphae can penetrate solid substrates, such as foods, making their extraction difficult. In addition, fungi differentiate to produce spores, resulting in large increases in viable counts often with little relationship to biomass (Pitt, 1984). A number of methods have been developed for quantifying fungal growth and their principles and applications comprehensively reviewed (Matcham et al., 1984; Hartog and Notermans, 1988; Williams, 1989; Newell \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "MrD03xAAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8800019763605887106", "cites_id": ["8800019763605887106"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/0-387-28391-9_3.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:glglulnzH3oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 7, "2016": 0, "2017": 8, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
