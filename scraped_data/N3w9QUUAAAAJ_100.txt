To investigate the biological function of this effector and the mechanisms of specific recognition by the P resistance protein, we determined the crystal structure of AvrP. The structure reveals an elongated zinc\u2010finger\u2010like structure with a novel interleaved zinc\u2010binding topology. The residues responsible for zinc binding are conserved in AvrP effector variants and mutations of these motifs result in a loss of P\u2010mediated recognition. The first zinc\u2010coordinating region of the structure displays a positively charged surface and shows some limited similarities to nucleic acid\u2010binding and chromatin\u2010associated proteins. We show that the majority of the AvrP protein accumulates in the plant nucleus when \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2050559032707032696", "cites_id": ["2050559032707032696"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mpp.12597", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eKZ4b5MMdRwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 9, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
