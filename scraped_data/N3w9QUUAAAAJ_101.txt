In contrast, many fungal species carry multiple haploid nuclei per cell. Rust fungi are such species with two nuclei (karyons) that contain a full set of haploid chromosomes each. The physical separation of haplotypes in dikaryons means that, unlike in diploids, Hi-C chromatin contacts between haplotypes are false-positive signals.We generate the first chromosome-scale, fully-phased assembly for the dikaryotic leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina and compare Nanopore MinION and PacBio HiFi sequence-based assemblies. We show that false-positive Hi-C contacts between haplotypes are predominantly caused by phase switches rather than by collapsed regions or Hi-C read mis-mappings. We introduce a method for phasing of dikaryotic genomes into the two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7943718291337633440", "cites_id": ["7943718291337633440"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-022-02658-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oN7zxrLBPW4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 11, "2023": 10}}
