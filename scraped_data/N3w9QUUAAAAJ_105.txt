Despite its importance, almost nothing is known about the genomics of this pathogen, and a reference genome is lacking. In this study, the first reference genome was assembled for an Australian isolate of Ph (\u201cPh560\u201d) using long-read SMRT sequencing. A total of 838 contigs were assembled, with a total size of 207 Mbp. This included both haplotype collapsed and separated regions, consistent with an estimated haploid genome size of about 150Mbp. An annotation pipeline that combined RNA-Seq of Ph-infected host tissues and homology to proteins from four other Puccinia species predicted 25,543 gene models of which 1,450 genes were classified as encoding secreted proteins based on the prediction of a signal peptide and no transmembrane domain. Genome resequencing using short-read technology was conducted \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15534763801565835778", "cites_id": ["15534763801565835778"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/9/10/3263/6026710", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ArLt7V6RltcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
