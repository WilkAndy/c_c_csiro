These effectors are both a boon and a curse for pathogens as they modulate the host cellular environment or suppress defense response to allow fungal growth as well as become targets of plant resistance (R) proteins. Recognition of a fungal effector by a plant R protein triggers a hypersensitive reaction (HR) leading to death of plant cells in and around the infection site, thus preventing further proliferation of the pathogen. Such HR induction has been used as an indicator of effector activity in functional assays of candidate effectors in dicots based on Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. However, the Agrobacterium assay is not functional in cereal leaves. We therefore have adapted an alternative assay based on effector protein delivery using the type III \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3043957960822869162", "cites_id": ["3043957960822869162"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-62703-986-4_21", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qswRRqNPPioJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
