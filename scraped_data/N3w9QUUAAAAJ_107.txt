The extremely low level of this class of R proteins found in plant tissue has precluded their biochemical and structural analysis, and the study of these proteins has been largely restricted to genetic analyses and in vivo investigations. Here we report the production and purification of the M protein in the methalotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris. Expression trials with five different constructs reveals optimum levels of soluble native M protein can be obtained as an N\u2010terminally 9\u00d7 His\u2010tagged protein, in which the first 21 amino acids of the predicted wild\u2010type protein are deleted.
