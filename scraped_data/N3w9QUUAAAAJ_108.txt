These pathogens secrete virulence proteins, termed effectors, that modulate host cellular processes and promote infection. Plants have evolved immunity receptors that detect effectors and activate defence pathways, resulting in resistance to the invading pathogen. This leads to an evolutionary arms race between pathogen and host that is characterised by highly diverse effector repertoires in plant pathogens. Here, we review the recent advances in understanding host\u2013pathogen co-evolution provided by the structural determination of effectors alone, and in complex with immunity receptors. We highlight the use of recent advances in structural prediction within this field and its role for future development of designer resistance proteins."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14008175033760228661", "cites_id": ["14008175033760228661"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526622000395", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NSXGhvkIZ8IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 5, "2023": 10}}
