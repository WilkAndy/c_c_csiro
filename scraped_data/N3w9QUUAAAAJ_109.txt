Plant resistance mostly relies on effector recognition to activate defence responses. Understanding how effector proteins escape from plant surveillance is important for plant breeding and resistance deployment. Here we examined the role of genetic diversity of the stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt)) AvrSr50 gene in determining recognition by the corresponding wheat Sr50 resistance gene. We solved the crystal structure of a natural variant of AvrSr50 and used site\u2010directed mutagenesis and transient expression assays to dissect the molecular mechanisms explaining gain of virulence. We report that AvrSr50 can escape recognition by Sr50 through different mechanisms including DNA insertion, stop codon loss or by amino\u2010acid variation involving a single substitution of the AvrSr50 surface\u2010exposed residue Q121.
