It is shown that a protein crystal structure can be solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction based on the anomalous signal of a cobalt ion measured on a conventional monochromatic X-ray source. The unique absorption edge of cobalt (1.61\u2005\u00c5) is compatible with the Cu\u2005K\u03b1 wavelength (1.54\u2005\u00c5) commonly available in macromolecular crystallography laboratories. This approach was applied to the determination of the structure of Melampsora lini avirulence protein AvrL567-A, a protein with a novel fold from the fungal pathogen flax rust that induces plant disease resistance in flax plants. This approach using cobalt ions may be applicable to all cobalt-binding proteins and may be advantageous when synchrotron radiation is not readily available."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14080446719624479733", "cites_id": ["14080446719624479733"], "pub_url": "https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?gx5102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9QMIqrDLZ8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
