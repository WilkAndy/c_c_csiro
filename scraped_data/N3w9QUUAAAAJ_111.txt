However, the set of secreted proteins expressed during infection is too large for experimental investigations and contains not only effectors but also proteins that play a role in niche colonization or in fighting off competing microbes. Therefore, accurate computational prediction is essential for identifying high-priority rust effector candidates from secretomes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1438730631820115316", "cites_id": ["1438730631820115316"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7249-4_7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dH0cDeNl9xMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
