In susceptible hosts, these pathogens infect and establish a dynamic relationship with living plant cells through which they redirect plant resources to support pathogen growth and reproduction. During evolution, biotrophic infection strategies have become finely tuned to allow the pathogen to avoid or suppress the plant\u2019s defence response and to take control of host cell organisation and metabolism. Recent research has begun to uncover intriguing details of pathogen effector proteins that are instrumental in facilitating biotrophic growth. These effectors function in both the plant apoplast and cytoplasm. They enable plant penetration, they mask factors that normally trigger basal defence and they suppress the host defence response. Effectors responsible for redirecting host metabolism remain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6722176962950469572", "cites_id": ["6722176962950469572"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20966-6_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xBf6CVX4SV0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
