Resistance genes in plants act as an immune system by recognising specific components of the rust pathogen, encoded by avirulence (Avr) genes, and initiating defence responses. Recent advances in the model rust species, Melampsora lini, which infects cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum), has led to the identification of several avirulence genes. These encode secreted proteins that are expressed in haustoria, specialised rust structures that penetrate the host cell wall. The AvrL567, AvrM, AvrP4, and AvrP123 proteins are recognised when expressed intracellularly in resistant plants, and the AvrL567 proteins interact directly with the corresponding L5 and L6 cytoplasmic resistance proteins. These observations imply that rusts deliver a range of small effector \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12493781033605065472", "cites_id": ["12493781033605065472"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/ar07055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AOuKuafTYq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
