In comparison with our knowledge of bacterial effectors, the current understanding of how fungal effectors function is limited. In this study, we show that the effector AvrL567\u2010A from the flax rust fungus Melampsora lini interacts with a flax cytosolic cytokinin oxidase, LuCKX1.1, using both yeast two\u2010hybrid and in planta bimolecular fluorescence assays. Purified LuCKX1.1 protein shows catalytic activity against both N6\u2010(\u03942\u2010isopentenyl)\u2010adenine (2iP) and trans\u2010zeatin (tZ) substrates. Incubation of LuCKX1.1 with AvrL567\u2010A results in increased catalytic activity against both substrates. The crystal structure of LuCKX1.1 and docking studies with AvrL567\u2010A indicate that the AvrL567 binding site involves a flexible surface\u2010exposed region that surrounds the cytokinin substrate access site, which may explain its effect in modulating LuCKX1.1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13561434277383287183", "cites_id": ["13561434277383287183"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mpp.12749", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:j7E8rJ_kM7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
