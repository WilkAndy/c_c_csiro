To enable discovery of pathogen effectors and further our understanding of virulence evolution, we generated a chromosome-scale assembly for each of the 2 nuclear genomes of the oat crown rust pathogen, Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca). This resource complements 2 previously released partially phased genome references of Pca, which display virulence traits absent in the isolate of historic race 203 (isolate Pca203) which was selected for this genome project. A fully phased, chromosome-level reference for Pca203 was generated using PacBio reads and Hi-C data and a recently developed pipeline named NuclearPhaser for phase assignment of contigs and phase switch \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12349801118395046880", "cites_id": ["12349801118395046880"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article-abstract/12/8/jkac149/6613142", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4JuoZK9OY6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
