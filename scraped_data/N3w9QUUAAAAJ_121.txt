Several highly diverged pathogen classes have independently evolved haustoria, suggesting that they represent an effective adaptation for growing within living plant tissue. Despite their clear importance in biotrophy, they have been difficult to study due to the close association of biotrophic pathogens with their host and the inability to produce haustoria in vitro. These drawbacks have been circumvented in the study of rust fungi by the development of a haustoria isolation technique. The strong binding of the lectin concanavalin A (ConA) to rust haustoria allows these structures to be purified from infected plant tissue by affinity chromatography on a ConA\u2013Sepharose macrobead column. The isolation process results in substantial yields of intact haustoria that retain their cytoplasmic contents, making them amenable to experimentation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8914799745937899472", "cites_id": ["8914799745937899472"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-61737-998-7_8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0P9e5CK7t3sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
