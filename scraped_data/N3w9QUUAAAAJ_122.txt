Infection occurs when rust spores germinate on the leaf surface and subsequently, specialized infection structures called haustoria form inside host cells followed by sporulation. Small RNA and transcriptome sequencing during Pgt-wheat infection reveals that the Pgt RNA interference (RNAi) machinery has functionally diversified. A number of Pgt RNAi genes are strongly up-regulated during late infection compared to the start of infection. This coincides with the production of two distinct Pgt small RNA (sRNA) profiles. At the start of infection, Pgt induces predominantly 21 nt sRNAs with a 5\u2019 uracil derived from genes. In contrast, during late infection Pgt induces 22 nt sRNAs with a 5\u2019 adenine derived from repeats. Strikingly, over 85% of Pgt sRNAs are differentially expressed during infection, compared to only 4% of wheat sRNAs. Using chromatin conformation capture assay data (Hi-C), we define Pgt centromeres and show that sRNAs up-regulated during late infection are derived from those repeat-rich, gene-poor and transcriptionally silent centromeric regions. We conclude that the Pgt RNAi machinery is highly regulated, resulting in differential accumulation of sRNA types throughout the infection cycle. Such tight temporal control of the RNAi machinery has thus far not been observed in fungi and might ensure genome stability during sporulation in rust fungi.The wheat stem rust disease caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) is one of the most devastating crop diseases and of significant global interest.
