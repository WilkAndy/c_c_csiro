In order to investigate the structural basis of the AvrM\u2013M interaction and possible virulence-associated functions of AvrM, the C-terminal domains of two different AvrM variants (AvrM-A and avrM) were crystallized. Crystals of native AvrM-A were obtained using pentaerythritol ethoxylate (15/4 EO/OH) as a precipitant and diffracted X-rays to 2.9\u2005\u00c5 resolution. Selenomethionine-derivative crystals of similar quality were obtained using PEG 1500 as a precipitant. Both the native and selenomethionine-labelled AvrM-A crystals had symmetry of space group C2221 with eight molecules in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of avrM had symmetry of space group P212121 and diffracted X-rays to 2.7\u2005\u00c5 resolution. Initial AvrM-A phases were calculated using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2102676103360037008", "cites_id": ["2102676103360037008"], "pub_url": "https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?uo5031", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kEB6isY0Lh0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
