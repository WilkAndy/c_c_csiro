The spectrum of pathogen recognition capabilities is encoded in the host genome and can not be developed through the life of the organism as for animal acquired immunity. Despite this, plants have an amazing capacity to recognise pathogens through strategies involving both conserved and variable pathogen elicitors. Pathogens manipulate the defense response through secretion of virulence effector molecules. In turn, effectors themselves can act as elicitors, and can be disabled by the host. Overall, the pathogenic niche is highly evolved and carefully monitored by both participants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1396924008393475675", "cites_id": ["1396924008393475675"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP101215&dsid=DS5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WwaCAvzeYhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
