One particular type of self-incompatibility, gametophytic self-incompatibility, is found in many species of the family Solanaceae, including Nicotiana alata, a wild relative of tobacco. Gametophytic self-incompatibility in the genus Nicotiana is controlled by a single, multi-allelic locus called the S locus (East and Mangelsdorf, 1925). Incompatible pollen grains germinate normally, but at some point within the style, growth of the tube is arrested (de Nettancourt, 1977). One of the genes at the S locus encodes a glycoprotein with RNase activity (S-RNase), which is produced by cells of the transmitting tract of the style and secreted into the extracellular matrix (McClure et al., 1989). The S-RNases determine the self-incompatibility phenotype of the style (Lee et al., 1994; Murfett et al., 1994) and the RNase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18432290746010683438", "cites_id": ["18432290746010683438"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC157353/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LsivaMamzP8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 2}}
