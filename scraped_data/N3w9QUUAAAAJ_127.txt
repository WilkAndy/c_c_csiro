The N-terminal TIR domain from the nucleotide-binding (NB)\u2013leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of plant disease-resistance (R) proteins has been shown to play an important role in defence signalling. Recently, the crystal structure of the TIR domain from flax R protein L6 was determined and this structure, combined with functional studies, demonstrated that TIR-domain homodimerization is a requirement for function of the R protein L6. To advance the molecular understanding of the function of TIR domains in R-protein signalling, the protein expression, purification, crystallization and X-ray diffraction analyses of the TIR domains of the Arabidopsis thaliana R proteins RPS4 (resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 4) and RRS1 (resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum 1) and the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1877235458699812245", "cites_id": ["1877235458699812245"], "pub_url": "https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?bo5128", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ld2RI7RHDRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
