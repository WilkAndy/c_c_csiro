In animal Toll-like receptor signalling, both homotypic TIR-domain interactions between two receptor molecules and heterotypic interactions between receptors and TIR-domain-containing adaptors are required for initiation of an innate immune response. The TIR domains in cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) plant disease-resistance proteins are not as well characterized, but recent studies have suggested a role in defence signalling. In this study, the crystallization, X-ray diffraction analysis and preliminary structure determination of the TIR domain from the flax resistance protein L6 (L6TIR) are reported. Plate-like crystals of L6TIR were obtained using PEG 200 as a precipitant and diffracted X-rays to 2.3\u2005\u00c5 resolution.
