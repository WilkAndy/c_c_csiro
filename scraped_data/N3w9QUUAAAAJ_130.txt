For much of its life cycle, Pca is dikaryotic, with two separate haploid nuclei that may vary in virulence genotype, highlighting the importance of understanding haplotype diversity in this species. We generated highly contiguous de novo genome assemblies of two Pca isolates, 12SD80 and 12NC29, from long-read sequences. In total, we assembled 603 primary contigs for a total assembly length of 99.16 Mbp for 12SD80 and 777 primary contigs with a total length of 105.25 Mbp for 12NC29, and approximately 52% of each genome was assembled into alternate haplotypes. This revealed structural variation between haplotypes in each isolate equivalent to more than 2% of the genome size, in addition to about 260,000 and 380,000 heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 12SD80 and 12NC29, respectively. Transcript-based annotation identified 26,796 and 28,801 coding sequences for isolates 12SD80 and 12NC29, respectively, including about 7,000 allele pairs in haplotype-phased regions. Furthermore, expression profiling revealed clusters of co-expressed secreted effector candidates, and the majority of orthologous effectors between isolates showed conservation of expression patterns. However, a small subset of orthologs showed divergence in expression, which may contribute to differences in virulence between 12SD80 and 12NC29. This study provides the first haplotype-phased reference genome for a dikaryotic rust fungus as a foundation for future studies into virulence mechanisms in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4790100229795869869", "cites_id": ["4790100229795869869"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/179226.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rfR_q8faeUIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
