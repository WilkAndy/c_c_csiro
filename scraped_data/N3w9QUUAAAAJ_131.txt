Here, we described a pipeline using HiFi reads and Hi-C data to assemble a gigabase-sized fungal pathogen, Puccinia polysora f.sp. zeae, to haplotype-phased and chromosome-scale. The final assembled genome is 1.71 Gbp, with ~850 Mbp and 18 chromosomes in each haplotype, being currently one of the two giga-scale fungi assembled to chromosome level. Transcript-based annotation identified 47,512 genes for dikaryotic genome with a similar number for each haplotype. A high level of interhaplotype variation was found with 10% haplotype-specific BUSCO genes, 5.8 SNPs/kbp and structural variation accounting for 3% of the genome size. The P. polysora genome displayed over 85% repeat contents, with genome-size expansion and copy number increasing of species-specific orthogroups. Interestingly, these features did not affect overall synteny with other Puccinia species having smaller genomes. Fine-time-point transcriptomics revealed seven clusters of co-expressed secreted proteins that are conserved between two haplotypes. The fact that candidate effectors interspersed with all genes indicated the absence of a \u201ctwo-speed genome\u201d evolution in P. polysora. Genome resequencing of 79 additional isolates revealed a clonal population structure of P. polysora in China with low geographic differentiation. Nevertheless, a minor population differentiated from the major population by having mutations on secreted proteins including AvrRppC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2284575612481799957", "cites_id": ["2284575612481799957"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.18.492400.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FYd_VGpxtB8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
