We use Hi-C 25 data to define the Pgt centromeres and show that they are repeat-rich regions (~ 250 kb) that are highly 26 diverse in sequence between haplotypes and, like in plants, are enriched for young TEs. DNA cytosine 27 methylation is particularly active at centromeres but also associated with genome-wide control of young TE 28 insertions. Strikingly, over 90% of Pgt sRNAs and several RNAi genes are differentially expressed during 29 infection. Pgt induces waves of functionally diversified sRNAs during infection. The early wave sRNAs are 30 predominantly 21 nts with a 5 \u2018uracil derived from genes. In contrast, the late wave sRNAs are mainly 22 nt 31 sRNAs with a 5 \u2018adenine and are strongly induced from centromeric regions. TEs that overlap with late 32 wave sRNAs are more likely to be methylated, both inside and outside the centromeres, and methylated TEs 33 exhibit a silencing effect on nearby genes. 34"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7262245528068189885", "cites_id": ["7262245528068189885"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/htohxrj57vgftlznnndgpb4hgi/access/wayback/https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/09/469338.full.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vW4srNStyGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
