Here, we describe the catalytic activity and potential virulence function of the Nudix hydrolase effector AvrM14 from the flax rust fungus (Melampsora lini). We completed extensive in vitro assays to characterise the enzymatic activity of the AvrM14 effector. Additionally, we used in planta transient expression of wild\u2010type and catalytically\u2010dead AvrM14 versions followed by biochemical assays, phenotypic analysis, and RNA\u2010sequencing to unravel how the catalytic activity of AvrM14 impacts plant immunity. AvrM14 is an extremely selective enzyme capable of removing the protective 5\u2032 cap from mRNA transcripts in vitro. Homodimerisation of AvrM14 promoted biologically\u2010relevant mRNA cap cleavage in vitro and this activity was conserved in related effectors from other Melampsora spp. In planta expression of wild\u2010type AvrM14, but not the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10518093427465947649", "cites_id": ["10518093427465947649"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.18727", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AYp6uj7G95EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
