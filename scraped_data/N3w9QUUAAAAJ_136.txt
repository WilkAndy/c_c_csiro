Here we report the isolation of most of the alleles at wheat stem rust resistance gene locus SR9, representing the largest multi-allelic rust resistance locus in common wheat. The seven previously reported resistance alleles (Sr9a, Sr9b, Sr9d, Sr9e, Sr9f, Sr9g, and Sr9h) at the locus were characterised using a synergistic strategy. Loss-of-function mutants and/or transgenic complementation were used to confirm Sr9b, two haplotypes of Sr9e (Sr9e_h1, Sr9e_h2), Sr9g, and Sr9h. Each allele encodes a highly related nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) type immune receptor, containing a previously unreported motif at their N termini and an unusual long LRR domain, that confers resistance to a unique spectrum of isolates of the wheat stem rust pathogen. The only SR9 protein effective against stem rust pathogen race TTKSK (Ug99), SR9H, differed from SR9B by a single amino acid. SR9B and SR9G resistance proteins were also distinguished by only a single amino acid. The SR9 allelic series found in the B subgenome are orthologs of wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr21 located in the A subgenome with around 85% identity in protein sequences."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15440691003815594654", "cites_id": ["15440691003815594654"], "pub_url": "https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/handle/10754/685361", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nor_4KhaSNYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
