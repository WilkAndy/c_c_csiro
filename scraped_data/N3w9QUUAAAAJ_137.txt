Cytokinin oxidase regulates the levels of these plant hormones by catalyzing their irreversible oxidation, which contributes to the regulation of various morpho-physiological processes controlled by cytokinins. In this study, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the flax cytokinin oxidase LuCKX1.1 are reported. Plate-like crystals of LuCKX1.1 were obtained using PEG 3350 as a precipitant and diffracted X-rays to 1.78\u2005\u00c5 resolution. The protein crystals have the symmetry of space group C2 and are most likely to contain two molecules per asymmetric unit."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12223924947950701883", "cites_id": ["12223924947950701883"], "pub_url": "https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?pu5403", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ow2jm_kapKkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
