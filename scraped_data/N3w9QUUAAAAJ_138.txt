Kamoun (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell)", "abstract": "Rust fungi or Pucciniales (= Uredinales) represent the largest group of fungal plant pathogens, including more than 7000 species that collectively infect plants from almost all families. They are obligate biotrophs, meaning that they can only propagate in their plant hosts, and they generally have very narrow host ranges. Although some rusts can be cultured on very complex synthetic media (Staples, 2000), they have no known saprotrophic existence in nature and they rely on their living host to complete their biological cycle. These fungi are nearly ubiquitous and are responsible for major diseases of many plants domesticated by humankind, including cereals and legumes such as wheat, bean, and soybean, as well as perennial plants such as coffee and many tree species (Pennisi, 2010). Some rusts have been of long-standing concern for agriculture and forestry while others have emerged in recent epidemics. For instance, wheat rusts have been known since the earliest days of agriculture and can cause serious crop losses. A new strain of wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) called Ug99 emerged recently in East Africa and is now spreading through the Near East, causing worldwide concern since it overcomes many of the most widely used sources of resistance (Singh et al., 2008). Similarly, recent outbreaks of the soybean rust Phakopsora pachyrhizi in the United States raised serious concerns from the US Department of Agriculture for soybean production (Miles et al., 2003). Poplar leaf rust caused by Melampsora species is the most devastating and widespread disease of poplars and has limited the use of poplars in plantation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18002455619884048124", "cites_id": ["18002455619884048124"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=RbCMdSHpkegC&oi=fnd&pg=PA2082&dq=info:_F7sUwGS1fkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=PTufiuQcll&sig=Lkqgou1MSULbcWHmGCQUSrz6eak", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_F7sUwGS1fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
