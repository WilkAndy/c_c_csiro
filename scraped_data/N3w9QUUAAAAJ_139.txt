Activation of Toll\u2010interleukin\u20101 receptor (TIR) domain\u2010containing NLRs (TNLs) induces receptor oligomerization and close proximity of the TIR domain, which is required for TIR enzymatic activity. TIR\u2010catalyzed small signaling molecules bind to EDS1 family heterodimers and subsequently activate downstream helper NLRs, which function as Ca2+ permeable channel to activate immune responses eventually leading to cell death. Subcellular localization requirements of TNLs and signaling partners are not well understood, although they are required to understand fully the mechanisms underlying NLR early signaling. TNLs show diverse subcellular localization while EDS1 shows nucleocytosolic localization \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5818013375164829852", "cites_id": ["5818013375164829852"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.16195", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
