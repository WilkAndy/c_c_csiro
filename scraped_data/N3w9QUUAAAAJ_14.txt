The P2 resistance gene was identified by transposon tagging and transgenic expression. P2 is a member of a small multigene family and encodes a protein with nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain, as well as a C-terminal non-LRR (CNL) domain of \u223c150 amino acids. A related CNL domain was detected in almost half of the predicted Arabidopsis TIR-NBS-LRR sequences, including the RPS4 and RPP1 resistance proteins, and in the tobacco N protein, but not in the flax L and M proteins. Presence or absence of this domain defines two subclasses of TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes. Truncations of the P2 CNL domain cause loss of function, and evidence for diversifying selection was detected in this domain, suggesting \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 343, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2326554804188095038", "cites_id": ["2326554804188095038"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/13/1/163/6009412", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PiIcjkSVSSAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 18, "2003": 16, "2004": 27, "2005": 14, "2006": 19, "2007": 27, "2008": 11, "2009": 23, "2010": 16, "2011": 14, "2012": 12, "2013": 8, "2014": 15, "2015": 17, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 12, "2019": 20, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
