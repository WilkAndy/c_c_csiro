However, the genetic and molecular virulence mechanisms of Rce have not been elucidated. As a dikaryotic organism, the haplotype phasing of this fungus has not been completed so far. We applied a haplotype phasing algorithm to generate a high-quality near telomere-to-telomere nuclear-phased genome sequence of Rce strain R0301. Sixteen pairs of chromosomes were assigned to the A and B genomes with a total size of 83 Mb. Based on a dual-time course RNA-seq, 25308 genes were predicted. Genes for steroid biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism were significantly enriched, together with many genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and secreted effector proteins, which should be involved in infection of wheat plants. Population genomic analysis of 31 isolates collected in China during the last forty years suggests that this population has not undergone substantial differentiation over time.The finished genome reference is the basis of revealing pathogens\u2019 biology base. Many efforts have been made to produce the chromosome-scale assembly of fungi. However, the reference of many pathogenic fungi is highly fragmented, which prevents the analysis of genome structure variation, evolution and import pathogenicity genes. Here, we assembly the only chromosome-scale haplotype-phased reference of dikaryotic fungus so far. This assembly achieves the gold standard based on many evaluation software, which indicates that the pipeline developed in this study can be applied to assemble \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18166864332977315867", "cites_id": ["18166864332977315867"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.18.484966.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G6DT0duqHfwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
