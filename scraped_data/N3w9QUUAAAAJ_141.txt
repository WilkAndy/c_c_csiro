We examined three nuclear-phased genome assemblies of Puccinia triticina, which causes wheat leaf rust disease. We found that the most recently emerged Australian lineage is derived by nuclear exchange between two pre-existing lineages, which originated in Europe and North America. Haplotype-specific phylogenetic analysis reveal that repeated somatic exchange events have shuffled haploid nuclei between long-term clonal lineages, leading to a global population representing different combinations of a limited number of haploid genomes. Thus, nuclear exchange seems to be the predominant mechanism generating diversity and the emergence of new strains in this otherwise clonal pathogen. Such genomics-accelerated surveillance of pathogen evolution paves the way for more accurate global disease monitoring."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3627944098936325693", "cites_id": ["3627944098936325693"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.28.518271.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PQYTsu8LWTIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
