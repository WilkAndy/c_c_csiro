We have been using the flax (Linum usitatissimum) and flax rust (Melampsora lini) model system to study disease resistance mechanisms to this important class of pathogens. Rust resistance in flax and other plants is mediated by the plant innate immunity system in which highly polymorphic resistance (R) proteins act as receptors that recognize specific avirulence (Avr) proteins produced by the pathogen. This race-specific resistance is characterised by Flor\u2019s \u201cgene-for-gene\u201d model, first proposed based on the flax rust system. In gene-for-gene resistance, recognition between the R and Avr proteins initiates defense responses leading to host resistance to infection, including a localised necrosis or hypersensitive response. Nineteen different rust resistance genes have been cloned from flax, including 11 allelic variants of the L locus, which all encode cytosolic proteins with conserved nucleotide-binding (NB) and Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. Four families of Avr genes,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4157230384196656486", "cites_id": ["4157230384196656486"], "pub_url": "https://globalrust.org/sites/default/files/posters/dodds_2009.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Zp2AKwJzsTkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
