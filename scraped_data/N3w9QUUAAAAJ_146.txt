Here we have developed a split GAL4 RUBY assay that enables macroscopically visual PPI detection in plant leaves in real time. Candidate interacting protein partners are fused to specific domains of the yeast GAL4 and herpes simplex virus VP16 transcription factors and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamina leaves by Agrobacterium infiltration. PPI, that may be either direct or indirect, results in transcriptional activation of a RUBY reporter gene leading to the production of the highly visual metabolite, betalain, in leaf tissue of living plants. Samples require no processing for in planta visual qualitative assessment, but with very simple processing steps the assay is quantitative. Its accuracy is demonstrated using a series of known interacting protein partners and mutant derivatives including transcription factors, signalling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.16234", "cites_per_year": {}}
