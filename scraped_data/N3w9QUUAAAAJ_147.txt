Historically, Puccinia species have posed a threat to members of the Poaceae plant family; however, recent outbreaks have raised awareness of their destructive nature. This chapter focuses on Puccinia species that have caused epidemics affecting crops that account for half of the global food production. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technology and computational approaches have increased our understanding of virulence evolution in rust fungi and the molecular factors behind disease epidemics. Pioneering research has revealed the first few avirulence (Avr) genes from Puccinia species, and novel mechanisms behind the diversification of pathogen populations, which enable the coevolutionary arms race between Puccinia members and their hosts.
