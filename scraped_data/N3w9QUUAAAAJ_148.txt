Previous studies in wheat have shown promising data suggesting the type III secretion system (T3SS) of bacteria may be a suitable surrogate for delivery and detection of Avr properties of fungal effectors. However, these delivery systems were tested in the absence of confirmed Avr effectors. Here, we tested two previously described T3SS-mediated delivery systems for their suitability when delivering two confirmed Avr effectors from two fungal pathogens of wheat, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype tritici. We showed that both effectors (AvrSr50 and AvrRmg8) were unable to elicit a hypersensitive response on wheat seedlings with the corresponding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-08-22-0167-SC", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Gfsgd8wFhQEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
