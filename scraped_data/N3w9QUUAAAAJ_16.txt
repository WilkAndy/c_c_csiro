In Arabidopsis, the immune receptors RPS4 and RRS1 are both required to activate defense to three different pathogens. We show that RPS4 and RRS1 physically associate. Crystal structures of the N-terminal Toll\u2013interleukin-1 receptor/resistance (TIR) domains of RPS4 and RRS1, individually and as a heterodimeric complex (respectively at 2.05, 1.75, and 2.65 angstrom resolution), reveal a conserved TIR/TIR interaction interface. We show that TIR domain heterodimerization is required to form a functional RRS1/RPS4 effector recognition complex. The RPS4 TIR domain activates effector-independent defense, which is inhibited by the RRS1 TIR domain through the heterodimerization interface. Thus, RPS4 and RRS1 function as a receptor complex in which the two components play distinct \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 325, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6161663038052781852", "cites_id": ["6161663038052781852"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1247357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HE_KIOOfglUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 20, "2015": 31, "2016": 49, "2017": 37, "2018": 30, "2019": 40, "2020": 40, "2021": 38, "2022": 29, "2023": 10}}
