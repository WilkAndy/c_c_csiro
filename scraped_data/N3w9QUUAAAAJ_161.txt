These concerns have 33 catalyzed an extensive global effort towards controlling this disease. Substantial 34 research and breeding programs target the identification and introduction of new stem 35 rust resistance (Sr) genes in cultivars for genetic protection against the disease. Such 36 resistance genes typically encode immune receptor proteins that recognize specific 37 components of the pathogen, known as avirulence (Avr) proteins. A significant 38 drawback to deploying cultivars with single Sr genes is that they are often overcome by 39 evolution of the pathogen to escape recognition through alterations in Avr genes. Thus, 40 a key element in achieving durable rust control is the deployment of multiple effective Sr 41 genes in combination, either through conventional breeding or transgenic approaches, 42 to minimize the risk of resistance breakdown. In this situation, evolution of pathogen 43 virulence would require changes in multiple Avr genes in order to bypass recognition. 44 However, choosing the optimal Sr gene combinations to deploy is a challenge that 45 requires detailed knowledge of the pathogen Avr genes with which they interact and the 46 virulence phenotypes of Pgt existing in nature. Identifying specific Avr genes from Pgt 47 will provide screening tools to enhance pathogen virulence monitoring, assess 48 heterozygosity and propensity for mutation in pathogen populations, and confirm 49 individual Sr gene functions in crop varieties carrying multiple effective resistance 50 genes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melania-Figueroa/publication/293489431_Changing_the_Game_Using_Integrative_Genomics_to_Probe_Virulence_Mechanisms_of_the_Stem_Rust_Pathogen_Puccinia_graminis_f_sp_tritici/links/56b92ea508ae39ea9905c857/Changing-the-Game-Using-Integrative-Genomics-to-Probe-Virulence-Mechanisms-of-the-Stem-Rust-Pathogen-Puccinia-graminis-f-sp-tritici.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
