It has been well established, especially through the work on TLRs, that signalling depends on regulated self-association of TIR domains. However, every single TIR domain structure has revealed a different association mode [1]. In the search for common features, we have targeted a number of TIR domains from mammals, plants and bacteria to characterize structurally. We have determined the crystal structures of the TIR domains from the human TLR adaptor protein MAL [1], the bacterial protein TcpB from Brucella melitensis [2] and the plant immune proteins L6 from flax [3] and SNC1, RPS4 and RRS1 from Arabidopsis (unpublished). In the case of the proteins RPS4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2014/a1/00/a51542/a51542.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
