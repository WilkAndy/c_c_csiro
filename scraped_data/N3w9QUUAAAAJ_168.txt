From a molecular point of view, very little is known about this organism, in particular its remarkable capacity to mutate to virulence on previously resistant wheat cultivars. In an effort to overcome this, we generated several datasets to map the genome, and describe deployment of the pathogen\u2019s genes during infection. The most important goal of these studies is to identify virulence genes called effectors, which typically are secreted by the pathogen into the host tissue to promote the infection. A subset of effectors can be recognised by the host immune (resistance) machinery, and these are designated avirulence (Avr) genes in the jargon. By characterising genes expressed in the fungal haustoria, we identified 531 candidate effector genes which encode secreted proteins characteristic of effectors. These are largely novel proteins which are generally not shared with those described from the related species Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causative agent of wheat stem rust. Overall, the sequences give little indication to function, and further insight will be derived from genomic characterisation of related pathogen strains with differing pathogenicity profiles."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Dodds/publication/267200095_Identification_and_characterisation_of_effector_genes_from_the_wheat_stripe_rust_fungus/links/548105900cf263ee1adfad97/Identification-and-characterisation-of-effector-genes-from-the-wheat-stripe-rust-fungus.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gvTiFlvgcCAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
