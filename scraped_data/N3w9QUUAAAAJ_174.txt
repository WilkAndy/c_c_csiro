During the infection process intercellular hyphae differentiate to produce haustoria, which penetrate the host cell wall and invaginate the plasma membrane. Haustoria are the primary sites for nutrient uptake and host cell communication but are also the site of recognition in resistant plants (Hahn and Mendgen, 2001; Heath, 1997). Other obligate biotrophs, such as the downy mildews (oomycetes) and the powdery mildews (ascomycetes), also produce haustoria although these have probably evolved independently. Hemibiotrophic pathogens, such as the oomycete Phytophthora, also form haustoria early in infection, but later induces host cell death and enters a necrotrophic phase. The flax (Linum usitatissimum) and flax rust (Melampsora lini) disease system has been an enduring model system in plant disease resistance, having been the basis for Flor\u2019s \u201cgene-for-gene\u201d model. In gene-for-gene resistance, the products of host resistance (R) genes determine recognition of pathogen \u201cavirulence\u201d(Avr) gene products to initiate defense responses leading to resistance. One of the hallmarks of this system is the high degree of specificity between corresponding R and Avr genes. Previous isolation of flax resistance genes, including 11 alleles of the L locus and representatives of the M, N and P loci, has provided insights into resistance gene specificity.
