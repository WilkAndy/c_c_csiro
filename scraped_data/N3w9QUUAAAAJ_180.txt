The red, orange, yellow and green segments on the lower bar indicate the fraction of residues that contain outliers for>= 3, 2, 1 and 0 types of geometric quality criteria. A grey segment represents the fraction of residues that are not modelled. The numeric value for each fraction is indicated below the corresponding segment, with a dot representing fractions<= 5% The upper red bar (where present) indicates the fraction of residues that have poor fit to the electron density. The numeric value is given above the bar."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8290541270296988613&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
