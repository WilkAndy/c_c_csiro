The protein net charge, isoelectric point and frequencies of amino acid classes (tiny, small, aliphatic, aromatic, nonpolar, polar, charged, basic, acidic) in the sequence were calculated using pepstats (Rice et al., 2000). The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), classes of predicted secondary structure elements (helix, turn, sheet) and aromaticity were calculated using ProtParam"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7121399335539302003&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c96FAvdK1GIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
