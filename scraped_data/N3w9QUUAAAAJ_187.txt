Protein structure of fungal effector AvrP reveals molecular mechanisms for fungal infection in plants", "citation": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, 24, 0", "author": "Xiaoxiao Zhang and Thomas Ve Simon Williams and Peter N Dodds and G Jeffrey", "journal": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences", "pages": "24", "abstract": "Crop losses due to fungal pathogens represent one of the most serious threats to global food production. Many fungal pathogens infect plant by delivering a diverse set of secreted proteins into plant cells to manipulate host defences and metabolism (1). Those proteins are referred to as \u2018effectors\u2019. Plants recognize some of the effectors, designated avirulence (Avr) proteins, through plant resistance (R) proteins and trigger defense responses to limit pathogen spread. The molecular functions of most fungal effector proteins have not been identified.AvrP from flax-rust is recognised by the flax resistance protein P and is a small secreted cysteine-rich protein of unknown function with sequence similarity to disulfide-containing Kazal protease inhibitors (2). However, homology modeling and biochemical studies suggest that AvrP is not disulfide-bonded and may be strucutrally similar to plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4994949380366622197&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9V3PP_-fUUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
