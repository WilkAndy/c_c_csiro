We show that RGA4 and RGA5, two NB\u2010LRRs from rice, interact functionally and physically to mediate resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae and accomplish different functions in AVR recognition. RGA4 triggers an AVR\u2010independent cell death that is repressed in the presence of RGA5 in both rice protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana. Upon recognition of the pathogen effector AVR\u2010Pia by direct binding to RGA5, repression is relieved and cell death occurs. RGA4 and RGA5 form homo\u2010 and hetero\u2010complexes and interact through their coiled\u2010coil domains. Localization studies in rice protoplast suggest that RGA4 and RGA5 localize to the cytosol.
