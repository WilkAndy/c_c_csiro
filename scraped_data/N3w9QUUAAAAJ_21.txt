R genes have now been cloned from four of the five loci in flax and all encode proteins of the Toll, Interleukin-1 receptor, R gene-nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR) class. Avr genes have been cloned from four loci in flax rust and encode small secreted proteins with no between locus similarity and no close homologs in current data bases. It is postulated that Avr proteins enter the host cell, have virulence effector functions, and in resistant host genotypes, are recognized by direct and specific interaction with host R proteins, leading to activation of rust resistance defense responses. Direct interaction between R and Avr proteins is the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 257, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2914462989455000600", "cites_id": ["2914462989455000600"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.phyto.45.062806.094331", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GAR9vaVAcigJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 12, "2009": 39, "2010": 22, "2011": 28, "2012": 25, "2013": 18, "2014": 19, "2015": 12, "2016": 13, "2017": 15, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
