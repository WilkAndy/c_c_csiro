Recent advances are revealing the extensive effector repertoires of these pathogens and are beginning to shed light on how they manipulate host cells to establish a parasitic relationship. Surprisingly, oomycete effectors seem to share a common uptake system with those from the human malaria pathogen. The current explosion of information is opening new research avenues in molecular plant pathology and is providing new opportunities to limit the impact of plant disease on food production."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 239, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17118802675424194754", "cites_id": ["17118802675424194754"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1171652", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wnCqgFU0ku0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 26, "2011": 25, "2012": 27, "2013": 19, "2014": 25, "2015": 24, "2016": 17, "2017": 11, "2018": 17, "2019": 13, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
