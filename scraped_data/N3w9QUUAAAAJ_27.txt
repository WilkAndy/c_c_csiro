A number of secreted fungal avirulence (Avr) proteins are also inferred to be delivered into host cells, based on their intracellular recognition by host resistance proteins, including those of flax rust (Melampsora lini). Here, we show by immunolocalization that the flax rust AvrM protein is secreted from haustoria during infection and accumulates in the haustorial wall. Five days after inoculation, the AvrM protein was also detected within the cytoplasm of a proportion of plant cells containing haustoria, confirming its delivery into host cells during infection. Transient expression of secreted AvrL567 and AvrM proteins fused to cerulean fluorescent protein in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and flax cells resulted in intracellular accumulation of the fusion proteins \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 204, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10830935002208858400", "cites_id": ["10830935002208858400"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/22/6/2017/6095920", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IPEA8P81T5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 7, "2011": 32, "2012": 27, "2013": 27, "2014": 18, "2015": 21, "2016": 16, "2017": 13, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 4, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
