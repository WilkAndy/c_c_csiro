Local adaptation studies demonstrate partner impacts on fitness and adaptive change, but do not directly expose genetic processes predicted by theory. Specifically, we have little knowledge of the relative importance of fluctuating selection vs. arms\u2010race dynamics in maintaining polymorphism in natural systems where metapopulation processes predominate. We conducted cross\u2010year epidemiological, infection and genetic studies of multiple wild host and pathogen populations in the Linum\u2010Melampsora association. We observed asynchronous phenotypic fluctuations in resistance and infectivity among demes. Importantly, changes in allelic frequencies at pathogen infectivity loci, and in host \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 202, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10919900029599917112", "cites_id": ["10919900029599917112"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01749.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OKQUhzhHi5cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 13, "2014": 43, "2015": 19, "2016": 27, "2017": 20, "2018": 14, "2019": 16, "2020": 14, "2021": 10, "2022": 12, "2023": 8}}
