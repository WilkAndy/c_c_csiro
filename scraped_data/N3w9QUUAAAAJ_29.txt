Recent studies have identified a class of pathogenicity effector proteins from these pathogens that is transferred into host cells from haustoria during infection. This insight stemmed from the identification of avirulence (Avr) proteins from these pathogens that are recognized by intracellular host resistance (R) proteins. Oomycete effectors contain a conserved translocation motif that directs their uptake into host cells independently of the pathogen, and is shared with the human malaria pathogen. Genome sequence information indicates that oomycetes may express several hundred such host\u2010translocated effectors. Elucidating the transport mechanism of fungal and oomycete effectors and their roles in disease offers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 199, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6252220181649194532", "cites_id": ["6252220181649194532"], "pub_url": "https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02922.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JH66KCFZxFYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 15, "2011": 29, "2012": 17, "2013": 9, "2014": 19, "2015": 12, "2016": 14, "2017": 13, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 13, "2022": 14, "2023": 10}}
