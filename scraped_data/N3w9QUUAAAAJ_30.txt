We show that Sr50 confers a unique resistance specificity different from Sr31 and other genes on rye chromosome 1RS, and is effective against the broadly virulent Ug99 race lineage. Extensive haplotype diversity at the rye Sr50 locus holds promise for mining effective resistance genes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 191, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16094747168615789098", "cites_id": ["16094747168615789098"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nplants2015186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KnIRt0YHXN8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 15, "2017": 17, "2018": 22, "2019": 26, "2020": 27, "2021": 38, "2022": 38, "2023": 7}}
