The AvrM effector from flax rust is a small secreted protein that is recognized by the M resistance protein in flax. Here, we investigate the mechanism of M\u2013AvrM recognition and show that these two proteins directly interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay, and that this interaction correlates with the recognition specificity observed for each of the different AvrM variants. We further characterize this interaction by demonstrating that the C-terminal domain of AvrM is required for M-dependent cell death, and show that this domain also interacts with the M protein in yeast. We investigate the role of C-terminal differences among the different AvrM proteins for their involvement in this interaction and establish that M recognition is hindered by an additional 34 amino acids \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 162, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8891351044617518275", "cites_id": ["8891351044617518275"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-23-1-0049", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w7y5q6psZHsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 10, "2011": 18, "2012": 12, "2013": 11, "2014": 15, "2015": 10, "2016": 11, "2017": 14, "2018": 10, "2019": 19, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
