Variation in disease resistance is a widespread phenomenon in wild plant\u2013pathogen associations. Here, we review current literature on natural plant\u2013pathogen associations to determine how diversity in disease resistance is distributed at different hierarchical levels \u2013 within host individuals, within host populations, amongst host populations at the metapopulation scale and at larger regional scales. 2. We find diversity in resistance across all spatial scales examined. Furthermore, variability seems to be the best counter\u2010defence of plants against their rapidly evolving pathogens. We find that higher diversity of resistance phenotypes also results in higher levels of resistance at the population level. 3. Overall, we find that wild plant populations are more likely to be susceptible than resistant to their pathogens. However, the degree of resistance differs strikingly depending on the origin of the pathogen strains used in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7818171116134704666", "cites_id": ["7818171116134704666"], "pub_url": "https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01738.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GqZtKjW5f2wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 15, "2014": 20, "2015": 16, "2016": 15, "2017": 14, "2018": 16, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 12, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
