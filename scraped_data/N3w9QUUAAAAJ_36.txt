Flax rust (Melampsora lini) AvrL567 avirulence proteins and the corresponding flax (Linum usitatissimum) L5, L6, and L7 resistance proteins interact directly. We determined the three-dimensional structures of two members of the AvrL567 family, AvrL567-A and AvrL567-D, at 1.4- and 2.3-A\u030a resolution, respectively. The structures of both proteins are very similar and reveal a \u03b2-sandwich fold with no close known structural homologs. The polymorphic residues in the AvrL567 family map to the surface of the protein, and polymorphisms in residues associated with recognition differences for the R proteins lead to significant changes in surface chemical properties. Analysis of single amino acid substitutions in AvrL567 proteins confirm the role of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 156, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17439005514537660729", "cites_id": ["17439005514537660729"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/19/9/2898/6092248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OXEYoh7LA_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 6, "2009": 11, "2010": 14, "2011": 18, "2012": 9, "2013": 10, "2014": 8, "2015": 7, "2016": 13, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 11, "2020": 6, "2021": 9, "2022": 13, "2023": 3}}
