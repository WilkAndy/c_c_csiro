Over the last few years, many efforts have greatly improved the understanding of effector and NB-LRR function, but have left a lot of questions as to how effector perception activates NB-LRR induction of defense signaling. This review describes exciting new findings showing similarities and differences in function of diverse plant NB-LRR proteins in terms of pathogen recognition and where and how resistance proteins are activated. Localization studies have shown that some NB-LRRs can activate signaling from the cytosol while others act in the nucleus. Also, the structural determination of two NB-LRR signaling domains demonstrated that receptor oligomerization is fundamental for the activation of resistance signaling."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 149, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14450258833600643066", "cites_id": ["14450258833600643066"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526611000835", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-n83MdmhicgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 4, "2012": 23, "2013": 20, "2014": 18, "2015": 16, "2016": 24, "2017": 14, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
