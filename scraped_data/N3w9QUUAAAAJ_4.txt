They are obligate biotrophs, which extract nutrients only from living plant tissues and cannot grow apart from their hosts. Their lifestyle has slowed the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying host invasion and avoidance or suppression of plant innate immunity. We sequenced the 101-Mb genome of Melampsora larici-populina, the causal agent of poplar leaf rust, and the 89-Mb genome of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat and barley stem rust. We then compared the 16,399 predicted proteins of M. larici-populina with the 17,773 predicted proteins of P. graminis f. sp tritici. Genomic features related to their obligate biotrophic lifestyle include expanded lineage-specific gene families, a large repertoire of effector-like small secreted proteins, impaired nitrogen and sulfur assimilation pathways, and expanded families of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 726, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1588204849617977601", "cites_id": ["1588204849617977601"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1019315108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AUEIZOVvChYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 18, "2012": 44, "2013": 54, "2014": 97, "2015": 64, "2016": 73, "2017": 60, "2018": 67, "2019": 47, "2020": 62, "2021": 54, "2022": 57, "2023": 25}}
