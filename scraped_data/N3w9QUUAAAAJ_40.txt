Plant pathogens deliver effectors both into the apoplast and inside host cells, but no computational method currently exists to discriminate between these localizations. We present ApoplastP, the first method for predicting whether an effector or plant protein localizes to the apoplast. ApoplastP uncovers features of apoplastic localization common to both effectors and plant proteins, namely depletion in glutamic acid, acidic amino acids and charged amino acids and enrichment in small amino acids. ApoplastP predicts apoplastic localization in effectors with a sensitivity of 75% and a false positive rate of 5%, improving the accuracy of cysteine\u2010rich classifiers by > 13%. ApoplastP does not depend on the presence of a signal peptide and correctly predicts the localization of unconventionally secreted proteins.
