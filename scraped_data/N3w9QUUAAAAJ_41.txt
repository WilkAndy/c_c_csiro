Comprehensive studies of the flax\u2013flax rust pathosystem have led to the postulation of the gene\u2010for\u2010gene model, a genetic paradigm describing recognition events between host disease resistance proteins and pathogen effector proteins. The identification of directly interacting fungal effector proteins and plant disease resistance proteins in this pathosystem has facilitated the study of both the physical nature of these interactions and the evolutionary forces that have resulted in a molecular arms race between these organisms. The flax\u2013flax rust pathosystem has also been detailed on the scale of interacting populations, and the integration of molecular\u2010 and population\u2010scale datasets represents a unique opportunity to further our understanding of many poorly understood facets of host \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 130, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7515026039681068399", "cites_id": ["7515026039681068399"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00657.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:by0A5V28SmgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 9, "2012": 13, "2013": 5, "2014": 13, "2015": 12, "2016": 10, "2017": 16, "2018": 11, "2019": 11, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
