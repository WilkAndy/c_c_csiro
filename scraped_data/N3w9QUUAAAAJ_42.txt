Several mutant and recombinant forms of L6 were made that altered either the methionine-histidine-aspartate (MHD) motif conserved in the NBS domain of resistance proteins or exchanged the short domain C-terminal to the LRR region that is highly variable among L allele products. In transgenic flax some of these alleles are autoactive; they cause a gene dosage-dependent dwarf phenotype and constitutive expression of genes that are markers for the plant defense response. Their effects and penetrance ranged from extreme to mild in their degree of plant stunting, survival, and reproduction. Dwarf plants were also resistant to flax rust \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=514201159827246446", "cites_id": ["514201159827246446"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-18-0570", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bs2YAjvPIgcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 9, "2007": 7, "2008": 9, "2009": 13, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
