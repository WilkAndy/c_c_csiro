Here, we use the interaction between the rust pathogen, Melampsora lini, and two host plants, Linum marginale and Linum usitatissimum, to examine how host\u2013pathogen interactions influence the maintenance of polymorphism in genes underlying pathogen virulence. Extensive sequence variation at two effector loci (AvrP123, AvrP4) was found in M. lini isolates collected from across the native range of L. marginale in Australia, as well as in isolates collected from a second host, the cultivated species L. usitatissimum. A highly significant excess of nonsynonymous compared with synonymous polymorphism was found at both loci, suggesting that diversifying selection is important for the maintenance of the observed sequence diversity.
