RNase NE is 86% identical to an extracellular RNase from tomato cell cultures, RNase LE. DNA hybridisation experiments indicate that there are ca. 5\u20136 sequences related to RNase NE in the N. alata genome and that RNase NE is not linked to the self-incompatibility (S) locus. RNase NE is expressed in the styles, petals and immature anthers but not in the vegetative tissues of N. alata plants under normal growth conditions. Under phosphate-limited conditions, RNase NE expression is induced in roots but not leaves of N. alata. A transcript hybridising to RNase NE is also induced in N. plumbaginifolia cell cultures in response to phosphate starvation. RNase NE is likely to play a role in the response of N. alata to phosphate limitation, possibly by scavenging phosphate from sources \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2425310883051432296", "cites_id": ["2425310883051432296"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00021786", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aGkr9mVvqCEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 8, "1999": 10, "2000": 5, "2001": 15, "2002": 8, "2003": 6, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
