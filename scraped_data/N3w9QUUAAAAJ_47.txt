Although Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression has enabled high-throughput functional analysis of effectors in dicot plants, this assay is not effective in cereal leaves. Here, we show that a nonpathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens engineered to express the type III secretion system (T3SS) of P. syringae and the wheat pathogen Xanthomonas translucens can deliver fusion proteins containing T3SS signals from P. syringae (AvrRpm1) and X. campestris (AvrBs2) avirulence (Avr) proteins, respectively, into wheat leaf cells. A calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase reporter protein was delivered effectively into wheat and barley by both bacteria. Absence of any disease symptoms with P. fluorescens makes it more suitable than X. translucens for detecting a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13417526174136922558", "cites_id": ["13417526174136922558"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-07-13-0187-FI", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vvHvXfegNLoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 13, "2015": 15, "2016": 14, "2017": 20, "2018": 10, "2019": 14, "2020": 13, "2021": 3, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
