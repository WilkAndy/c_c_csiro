Structure-based studies identified different TIR-domain dimerization interfaces required for signaling of the plant nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) L6 from flax and disease resistance protein RPS4 from Arabidopsis. Here we show that the crystal structure of the TIR domain from the Arabidopsis NLR suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1 (SNC1) contains both an L6-like interface involving helices \u03b1D and \u03b1E (DE interface) and an RPS4-like interface involving helices \u03b1A and \u03b1E (AE interface). Mutations in either the AE- or DE-interface region disrupt cell-death signaling activity of SNC1, L6, and RPS4 TIR domains and full-length L6 and RPS4. Self-association of L6 and RPS4 TIR domains is affected by mutations in either region \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8258579832322286666", "cites_id": ["8258579832322286666"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1621248114", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SmTGBppenHIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 12, "2018": 11, "2019": 15, "2020": 24, "2021": 23, "2022": 18, "2023": 12}}
