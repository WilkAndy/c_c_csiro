Anne Rehmany et al. have recently identified a potential host-targeting signal in oomycete avirulence proteins from Hyaloperonospora parasitica, Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora infestans that might be involved in transporting proteins into the host cell. This signal is surprisingly similar to the host targeting signal used by the malaria pathogen Plasmodium fulciparum to target virulence proteins to the mammalian host cell."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13159336937967642883", "cites_id": ["13159336937967642883"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138505003067", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A-k8Uzlbn7YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 15, "2007": 18, "2008": 13, "2009": 7, "2010": 10, "2011": 12, "2012": 7, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
