The predicted L6 and L11 proteins differ solely in the LRR region, whereas L6 and L7 differ solely in the TIR region. Thus, specificity differences between alleles can be determined by both the LRR and TIR regions. Functional analysis in transgenic plants of recombinant alleles constructed in vitro provided further information: L10\u2013L2 and L6\u2013L2 recombinants, encoding the LRR of L2, conferred L2 resistance specificity, and an L2\u2013L10 recombinant, encoding the LRR of L10, conferred a novel specificity. The sequence comparisons also indicate that the evolution of L alleles has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 620, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10706234763828095238", "cites_id": ["10706234763828095238"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/11/3/495/6008543", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BmnpK8svlJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 7, "2000": 35, "2001": 38, "2002": 36, "2003": 33, "2004": 29, "2005": 22, "2006": 26, "2007": 39, "2008": 31, "2009": 28, "2010": 27, "2011": 25, "2012": 34, "2013": 25, "2014": 28, "2015": 23, "2016": 19, "2017": 19, "2018": 16, "2019": 21, "2020": 22, "2021": 17, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
