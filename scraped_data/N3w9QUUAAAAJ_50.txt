These eukaryotic filamentous pathogens secrete effector proteins to facilitate plant infection. Fungi and oomycete pathogens have diverse infection strategies and their effectors generally do not share sequence homology. However, they occupy similar host environments, either the plant apoplast or plant cytoplasm, and, therefore, may share some unifying properties based on the requirements of these host compartments. Here, we exploit these biological signals and present the first classifier (EffectorP 3.0) that uses two machine-learning models: one trained on apoplastic effectors and one trained on cytoplasmic effectors. EffectorP 3.0 accurately predicts known apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors in fungal and oomycete secretomes with low estimated false-positive rates of 3 and 8%, respectively. Cytoplasmic effectors have a higher proportion of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9210212377998008659,9212552633107933431", "cites_id": ["9210212377998008659", "9212552633107933431"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-08-21-0201-R", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UyF6KFw_0X8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 64, "2023": 44}}
