We used a degenerate PCR approach, with primers directed to the nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain characteristic of many plant resistance genes, to isolate resistance gene analogs (RGAs) from flax. One RGA clone detected RFLPs co\u2010segregating with alleles of the N locus. With this probe we isolated four related genes that occur within a 30kbp region and encode proteins with NBS and leucine\u2010rich repeat (LRR) domains and N\u2010terminal Toll/Interleukin\u20101 Receptor homology (TIR) domains. One of these four genes was identified as the N resistance gene by sequence analysis of three mutant alleles and by transgenic expression. We isolated homologous genes from two flax lines containing the N1 or N2 specificities and from flax lines carrying no N locus resistance specificities.
