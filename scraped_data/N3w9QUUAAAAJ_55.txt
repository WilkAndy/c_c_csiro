Since then, many more R genes have been identified and characterized in numerous plant pathosystems. Most of these encode members of the large family of intracellular NLRs (NOD-like receptors), which also includes animal immune receptors. New discoveries in this expanding field of research provide new elements for our understanding of plant NLR function. But what do we know about plant NLR function today? Genetic, structural, and functional analyses have uncovered a number of commonalities and differences in pathogen recognition strategies as well as how NLRs are regulated and activate defense signaling, but many unknowns remain. This review gives an update on the latest discoveries and breakthroughs in this field, with an emphasis on structural findings and some comparison to animal NLRs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3451246271999827039", "cites_id": ["3451246271999827039"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-phyto-080516-035250", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X9zw6jJK5S8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 18, "2019": 34, "2020": 26, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
