The mechanistic basis of multi-pathogen resistance is largely unknown. Here we use comparative genomics, mutagenesis and transformation to isolate the wheat Lr67 gene, which confers partial resistance to all three wheat rust pathogen species and powdery mildew. The Lr67 resistance gene encodes a predicted hexose transporter (LR67res) that differs from the susceptible form of the same protein (LR67sus) by two amino acids that are conserved in orthologous hexose transporters. Sugar uptake assays show that LR67sus, and related proteins encoded by homeoalleles, function as high-affinity glucose transporters. LR67res exerts a dominant-negative effect through heterodimerization with these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 528, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2934259043845940774", "cites_id": ["2934259043845940774"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JiZq0w2VuCgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 24, "2017": 47, "2018": 56, "2019": 67, "2020": 76, "2021": 89, "2022": 123, "2023": 44}}
