To answer this, high-quality genomic resources that enable haplotype comparisons are essential. Short-read genome assemblies for dikaryotic fungi are highly fragmented and lack haplotype-specific information due to the high heterozygosity and repeat content of these genomes. Here, we present a diploid-aware assembly of the wheat stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici based on long reads using the FALCON-Unzip assembler. Transcriptome sequencing data sets were used to infer high-quality gene models and identify virulence genes involved in plant infection referred to as effectors. This represents the most complete Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici genome assembly to date (83 Mb, 156 contigs, N50 of 1.5 Mb) and provides phased haplotype information for over 92% of the genome \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11128036044100298629", "cites_id": ["11128036044100298629"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/mBio.02275-17", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hWdXwNK5bpoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 20, "2020": 19, "2021": 18, "2022": 18, "2023": 8}}
