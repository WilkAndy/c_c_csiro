The pollen grain hydrates and a pollen tube emerges from the grain and grows through the style to the ovary. The pollen tube consists of a single large vegetative cell carrying two sperm cells in its tip. When the pollen tube reaches an ovule, one sperm cell fuses with the haploid egg cell to form the embryo, while the second sperm cell fuses with a diploid accessory cell (the central cell) to form the endosperm, a specialized food-storage tissue. Communication between pollen and pistil is an essential factor in many aspects of this process. For example, directional cues enable pollen tubes to locate the ovules ("}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17839641069208727400", "cites_id": ["17839641069208727400"], "pub_url": "https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)81090-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aO-nsggjk_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 9, "1997": 7, "1998": 9, "1999": 7, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
