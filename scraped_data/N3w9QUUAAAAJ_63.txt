Increased durability and broad-spectrum resistance can be achieved by introducing more than one resistance gene, but combining numerous unlinked genes by breeding is laborious. Here we generate polygenic Pgt resistance by introducing a transgene cassette of five resistance genes into bread wheat as a single locus and show that at least four of the five genes are functional. These wheat lines are resistant to aggressive and highly virulent Pgt isolates from around the world and show very high levels of resistance in the field. The simple monogenic inheritance of this multigene locus greatly simplifies its use in breeding. However, a new Pgt isolate with virulence to several genes at this locus suggests gene stacks \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 84, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17573879254258784908", "cites_id": ["17573879254258784908"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00770-x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jJqzQxL24vMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 20, "2022": 50, "2023": 14}}
