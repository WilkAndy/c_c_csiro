The N termini of the Arabidopsis RPP1-WsB and RPS5 resistance proteins and the PBS1 protein, which is required for RPS5 resistance, targeted GFP to the plasma membrane, and mutation of predicted myristoylation and potential palmitoylation sites resulted in a shift to nucleocytosolic localization. The N-terminal domain of the membrane-attached Arabidopsis RPS2 resistance protein was targeted incompletely to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the N-terminal domains of the Arabidopsis RPP1-WsA and flax L6 and M resistance proteins, which carry predicted signal anchors, were targeted to the endomembrane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16686653455259685517", "cites_id": ["16686653455259685517"], "pub_url": "https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/abs/10.1094/MPMI-11-10-0272", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jVLMaujmkucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 12, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
