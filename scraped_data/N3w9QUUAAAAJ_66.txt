AvrM is a secreted effector protein from flax rust (Melampsora lini) that can internalize into plant cells in the absence of the pathogen, binds to phosphoinositides (PIPs), and is recognized directly by the resistance protein M in flax (Linum usitatissimum), resulting in effector-triggered immunity. We determined the crystal structures of two naturally occurring variants of AvrM, AvrM-A and avrM, and both reveal an L-shaped fold consisting of a tandem duplicated four-helix motif, which displays similarity to the WY domain core in oomycete effectors. In the crystals, both AvrM variants form a dimer with an unusual nonglobular shape. Our functional analysis of AvrM reveals that a hydrophobic surface patch conserved between both variants is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9317812564810750722", "cites_id": ["9317812564810750722"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1307614110", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Als36SiFT4EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 10, "2018": 8, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
