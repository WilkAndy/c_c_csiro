One gene is a homologue of the F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Fol) effector gene SIX6, encoding a 215\u2010residue cysteine\u2010rich secreted protein. The Six6 proteins from Fol and Fov contained eight conserved cysteine residues, five of which occurred in the highly diverged 48\u2010amino\u2010acid region where FovSix6 differs from FolSix6 at 32 residues. Two other potential effector genes, PEP1 and PEP2, were identified in a cDNA library of Fov genes expressed during infection of cotton. The presence of FovSIX6 and other differences in DNA fingerprints clearly distinguished Australian Fov isolates from non\u2010Australian Fov isolates and these differences further support the hypothesis based on earlier phylogenetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12130007780573161922", "cites_id": ["12130007780573161922"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02363.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wqnJE89xVqgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 9, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 11, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
