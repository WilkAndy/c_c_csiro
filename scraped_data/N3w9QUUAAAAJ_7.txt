Resistance of flax (Linum usitatissimum) to flax rust (Melampsora lini) involves the induction of a hypersensitive cell death response at haustoria formation sites, governed by gene-for-gene recognition between host resistance and pathogen avirulence genes. We identified genes encoding haustorially expressed secreted proteins (HESPs) by screening a flax rust haustorium-specific cDNA library. Among 429 unigenes, 21 HESPs were identified, one corresponding to the AvrL567 gene. Three other HESPs cosegregated with the independent AvrM, AvrP4, and AvrP123 loci. Expression of these genes in flax induced resistance gene\u2013mediated cell death with the appropriate specificity \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 525, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9648299256648375108", "cites_id": ["9648299256648375108"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/18/1/243/6114798", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RBsxFw6l5YUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 22, "2007": 44, "2008": 34, "2009": 53, "2010": 41, "2011": 55, "2012": 27, "2013": 28, "2014": 36, "2015": 23, "2016": 34, "2017": 27, "2018": 17, "2019": 19, "2020": 26, "2021": 18, "2022": 12, "2023": 6}}
