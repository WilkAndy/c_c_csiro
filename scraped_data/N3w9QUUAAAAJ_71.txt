Plant NLRs can be divided into several classes based upon their N-terminal signaling domains, including TIR (Toll-like, Interleukin-1 receptor, Resistance protein)- and CC (coiled-coil)-NLRs. Upon ligand detection, mammalian NAIP and NLRC4 NLRs oligomerize, forming an inflammasome that induces proximity of its N-terminal signaling domains. Recently, a plant CC-NLR was revealed to form an inflammasome-like hetero-oligomer. To further investigate plant NLR signaling mechanisms, we fused the N-terminal TIR domain of several plant NLRs to the N terminus of NLRC4. Inflammasome-dependent induced proximity of the TIR domain in planta initiated defense signaling. Thus, induced proximity of a plant TIR domain imposed by oligomerization of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13652138789202106914", "cites_id": ["13652138789202106914"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2001185117", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ihq5iuUjdr0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 20, "2022": 25, "2023": 16}}
