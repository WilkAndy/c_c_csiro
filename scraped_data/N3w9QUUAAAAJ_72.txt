The gene contains 8 introns, is expressed in germinating urediospores and vegetative mycelia and encodes a 448 amino acid protein that is similar to other fungal \u03b2-tubulin genes. Evidence for a second \u03b2-tubulin gene within the M. lini genome is also presented. The predicted M. lini \u03b2-tubulin protein was compared with 34 other fungal \u03b2-tubulin proteins in a phylogenetic analysis and, in general, good agreement was observed between the derived \u03b2-tubulin based phylogeny and the current taxonomic status of these species. However, a second \u03b2-tubulin protein found in five fungal species is atypical when compared to other fungal \u03b2-tubulin proteins. Analysis of intron positions within 33 fungal \u03b2-tubulin genes showed that intron location was generally characteristic of the fungal class, with euascomycete fungi showing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5363596229359117592", "cites_id": ["5363596229359117592"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756208619310", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GCWTYVpSb0oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 5, "2009": 9, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
