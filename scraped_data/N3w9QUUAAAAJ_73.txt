Studies by Harold Flor demonstrated that single pairs of allelic genes determine the avirulence/virulence phenotype on host lines with particular resistance genes and led him to propose his famous \u2018gene\u2010for\u2010gene\u2019 hypothesis. Flor's inheritance studies, together with those subsequently carried out by others, also revealed that, in some cases, an inhibitor gene pair and an avirulence/virulence gene pair interact to determine the infection outcome on host lines with particular resistance genes. Recently, avirulence/virulence genes at four loci, AvrL567, AvrM, AvrP4 and AvrP/AvrP123, have been cloned. All encode novel, small, secreted proteins that are recognized inside plant cells.
