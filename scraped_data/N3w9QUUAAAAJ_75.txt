The GFG paradigm was largely built on the foundations of Flor\u2019s early work on the flax\u2013flax rust interaction and is based on the concept of genetic recognition leading to incompatible disease outcomes, typical of host immune recognition. In contrast, the MA model is based on the assumption that genetic recognition leads to compatible interactions, which can result when pathogens require specific host factors to cause infection. Results from classical MA and GFG models have led to important predictions regarding various coevolutionary phenomena, including the role of fitness costs associated with resistance and infectivity, the distribution of resistance genes in wild populations, patterns of local adaptation and the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction. Empirical evidence (which we review briefly here), particularly from recent molecular advances in understanding of the mechanisms that determine the outcome of host\u2013pathogen encounters, suggests considerable variation in specific details of the functioning of interactions between hosts and pathogens, which may contain elements of both models. In this regard, GFG and MA scenarios likely represent endpoints of a continuum of potentially more complex interactions that occur in nature. Increasingly, this has been recognized in theoretical studies of coevolutionary processes in plant host\u2013pathogen and animal host-parasite associations (e.g., departures from strict GFG/MA assumptions, diploid genetics, multi \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5974409832956213086", "cites_id": ["5974409832956213086"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.01084/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xrf02xZe6VIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 15, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
