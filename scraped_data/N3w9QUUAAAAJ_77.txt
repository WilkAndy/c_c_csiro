Evidence showing that the effectors of some eukaryotic plant pathogens are able to interact directly with cytoplasmic host proteins indicates that translocation of these proteins into host cells is an important part of infection. Recently, we showed that the flax rust effectors AvrM and AvrL567 are able to internalize into plant cells in the absence of the pathogen. Further, N-terminal sequences that were sufficient for uptake were identified for both these proteins. In light of the possibility that the internalization of fungal and oomycete effectors may require binding to specific phospholipids, the lipid binding activities of AvrM and AvrL567 mutants with different abilities to enter cells were tested. While AvrL567 was not found to bind to phospholipids, AvrM bound strongly to phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl inositol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12545152511318881130", "cites_id": ["12545152511318881130"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/psb.5.10.13013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:avNC8r1VGa4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 13, "2012": 10, "2013": 9, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
