Plants can be protected from rust disease by resistance genes encoding receptors that trigger a highly effective defence response upon recognition of specific pathogen avirulence proteins. Identifying avirulence genes is crucial for understanding how virulence evolves in the field.To facilitate avirulence gene cloning in the flax rust fungus, Melampsora lini, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using single nucleotide polymorphisms detected in restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data. The map comprises 13,412 RADseq markers in 27 linkage groups that together span 5860 cM and contain 2756 recombination bins. The marker sequences were used to anchor 68.9 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14097009337257002818", "cites_id": ["14097009337257002818"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-016-3011-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QoeRlk2josMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 11, "2020": 11, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
