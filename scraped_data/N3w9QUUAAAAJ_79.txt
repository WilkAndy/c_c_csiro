One striking example is the wheat stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, which can rapidly evolve new virulent pathotypes in response to resistant host lines. Like several other filamentous fungal and oomycete plant pathogens, its genome features expanded gene families that have been implicated in host-pathogen interactions, possibly encoding effector proteins that interact directly with target host defense proteins. Previous efforts to understand virulence largely relied on the prediction of secreted, small and cysteine-rich proteins as candidate effectors and thus delivered an overwhelming number of candidates. Here, we implement an alternative analysis strategy that uses the signal of adaptive evolution as a line of evidence for effector function, combined with comparative information and expression data. We demonstrate that in planta up-regulated genes that are rapidly evolving are found almost exclusively in pathogen-associated gene families, affirming the impact of host-pathogen co-evolution on genome structure and the adaptive diversification of specialized gene families. In particular, we predict 42 effector candidates that are conserved only across pathogens, induced during infection and rapidly evolving. One of our top candidates has recently been shown to induce genotype-specific hypersensitive cell death in wheat. This shows that comparative genomics incorporating the evolutionary signal of adaptation is powerful for predicting effector candidates for laboratory verification. Our system can be applied to a wide range of pathogens and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9431885865226668497", "cites_id": ["9431885865226668497"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2014.00372/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0Qnd3jjK5IIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
