The first class, called R (for resistance) genes, are pathogen race specific in their action, effective at all plant growth stages and probably mostly encode immune receptors of the nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) class. The second class is called adult plant resistance genes (APR) because resistance is usually functional only in adult plants, and, in contrast to most R genes, the levels of resistance conferred by single APR genes are only partial and allow considerable disease development. Some but not all APR genes provide resistance to all isolates of a rust pathogen species and a subclass of these provides resistance to several fungal pathogen species. Initial indications are that APR genes encode a more heterogeneous range of proteins than R proteins. Two APR genes, Lr34 and Yr36, have been cloned from wheat and their products are an ABC transporter and a protein kinase, respectively. Lr34 and Sr2 have provided long lasting and widely used (durable) partial resistance and are mainly used in conjunction with other R and APR genes to obtain adequate rust resistance. We caution that some APR genes indeed include race specific, weak R genes which may be of the NB-LRR class. A research priority to better inform rust resistance breeding is to characterize further APR genes in wheat and to understand how they function and how they interact when multiple APR and R genes are stacked in a single genotype by conventional and GM breeding. An important message is do not be complacent about the general durability of all APR genes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 489, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7359685629723834762,1269258476231111947", "cites_id": ["7359685629723834762", "1269258476231111947"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2014.00641/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ink8QhbbImYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 14, "2016": 32, "2017": 56, "2018": 54, "2019": 69, "2020": 64, "2021": 73, "2022": 90, "2023": 33}}
