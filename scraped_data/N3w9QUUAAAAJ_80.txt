The key has been the identification of the role of pathogen effectors, proteins secreted at infection sites, some of which enter host cells to dampen host immunity and modify metabolism to pathogens\u2019 advantage. Knowledge of how effectors function and how their contributions to plant disease can be blocked promises ways of controlling crop diseases (1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15231932985280660346", "cites_id": ["15231932985280660346"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1111668108", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eoM1DlmyYtMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 8, "2013": 16, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
