Here the specificities of presumptive L1, L5, L8 and L11 genomic clones are confirmed by transgenic expression. L6 and L11 differ by 33 amino acids, 32 in the LRR region and one in the C\u2010terminal non\u2010LRR region, and recognize unrelated avirulence proteins, AvrL567 and AvrL11, respectively. To analyse the specificity differences, 13 L6L11 recombinant genes were constructed in vitro and tested in transgenic flax for resistance to F2 progeny of rust strain CH5, in which the unlinked avirulence genes AvrL567 and AvrL11 segregate. The data show that the single C\u2010terminal non\u2010LRR region polymorphism is not involved in L6\u2013L11 specificity differences, that polymorphisms necessary for specificity are spread \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16094499278041849399", "cites_id": ["16094499278041849399"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2006.00375.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nx53MdIlW98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 7, "2010": 2, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
