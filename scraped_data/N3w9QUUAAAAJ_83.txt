For much of its life cycle, P. coronata f. sp. avenae is dikaryotic, with two separate haploid nuclei that may vary in virulence genotype, highlighting the importance of understanding haplotype diversity in this species. We generated highly contiguous de novo genome assemblies of two P. coronata f. sp. avenae isolates, 12SD80 and 12NC29, from long-read sequences. In total, we assembled 603 primary contigs for 12SD80, for a total assembly length of 99.16 Mbp, and 777 primary contigs for 12NC29, for a total length of 105.25 Mbp; approximately 52% of each genome was assembled into alternate haplotypes. This revealed structural variation between haplotypes in each isolate equivalent to more than 2% of the genome size, in addition to about 260,000 and 380,000 heterozygous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12512098912601789106", "cites_id": ["12512098912601789106"], "pub_url": "https://journals.asm.org/doi/abs/10.1128/mBio.01650-17", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:slIuSKvno60J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
