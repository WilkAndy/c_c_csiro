The gene controlling the self-incompatibility phenotype of the pistil encodes an extracellular ribonuclease, the S-RNase. The gene(s) controlling the self-incompatibility phenotype of pollen (the pollen-S gene) has yet to be identified. As part of a long-term strategy to clone the pollen-S gene by chromosome walking, a detailed map of the region near the S locus of Nicotiana alata was generated using a total of 251 F2 plants. The map spans an interval of approximately 2.6 cM and contains five markers as well as the S-RNase gene. Two markers were detected with heterologous probes that also detect sequences linked to the S locus of Solanum tuberosum and the homologous region of the Lycopersicon genome. Three markers were identified by differential display using N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6758184195079489094", "cites_id": ["6758184195079489094"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001220051376", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RkZfErjkyV0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 3, "2003": 11, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
