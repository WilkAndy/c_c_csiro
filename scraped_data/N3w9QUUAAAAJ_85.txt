Many of these pathogens have a similar biotrophic life stage during which they contact host cells and secrete effector proteins that alter plant responses to infection . In this issue, comparative genomics studies of closely related pathogen species by Raffaele et al. on page 1540 , Baxter et al. on page 1549 , Spanu et al. on page 1543 , and Schirawski et al. on page 1546  reveal that such effector proteins evolve rapidly and that their diversity contributes to host range and parasite speciation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5355007983646067339", "cites_id": ["5355007983646067339"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1200245", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i8qammPPUEoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 8, "2012": 11, "2013": 5, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
