Although mutations in SGT1b were identified in these loss-of-resistance screens, no mutations were found in SGT1a (Austin et al., 2002; Muskett et al., 2002). Interestingly, the spectra of R genes that require RAR1 or SGT1 do not coincide with those of genes that use EDS1/PAD4 or NDR1, nor do they match the TIRNBS or CC-NBS classifications (Table 1). In fact, R genes from both classes and both pathways may require RAR1 and/or SGT1b to varying degrees, so that some R genes require RAR1 and"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10586898029139583300", "cites_id": ["10586898029139583300"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article-abstract/14/suppl_1/S5/6009907", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ROElbKo37JIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 7, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
