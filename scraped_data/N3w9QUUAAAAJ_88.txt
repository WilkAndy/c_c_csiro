While first characterized as avirulence factors that are recognized by host immune receptors, rust effectors are believed to play important roles in establishing successful infection. Several rust avirulence and effector proteins have been identified as small secreted proteins that are expressed in haustoria, and these characteristics have been used in the systematic prediction of effector gene candidates from recently sequenced rust genomes. The poplar rust and wheat stem rust genomes for instance contain over a thousand small secreted proteins that may have effector functions. These proteins are highly divergent between these rust species, reflecting the rapid evolution expected of virulence factors that directly engage with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14267897222581368782", "cites_id": ["14267897222581368782"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119949138.ch7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zre-6-3AAcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 5}}
