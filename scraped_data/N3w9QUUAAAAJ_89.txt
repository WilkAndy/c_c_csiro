Recent rust disease epidemics driven by the emergence of strains with novel virulence profiles demand a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms of these organisms. Here, we review research advances in genome-scale analysis coupled with functional validation of effector candidate genes that have been instrumental to elucidate processes that contribute to changes in virulence phenotypes. We highlight how haplotype-phased genome references have paved the road to link these processes to the reproductive phases of rust fungi and have provided evidence for somatic exchange between strains as an important mechanism for generating diversity in asexual populations. With increasing data availability, we envision the future development of molecular virulence diagnostic tools."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14390866462119078640", "cites_id": ["14390866462119078640"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526620300273", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8KqwHM2gtscJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 12, "2022": 20, "2023": 4}}
