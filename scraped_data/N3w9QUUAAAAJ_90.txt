We have cloned two additional functional resistance genes at this locus, M1 and M3, by transposon tagging and candidate gene approaches, and investigated the genetic relationships between four genes (M, M1, M3 and M4) by recombination analysis. M1 and M3, like M, are members of the nucleotide binding site, leucine\u2010rich repeat (NBS\u2010LRR) family. Comparisons of the predicted M1 and M3 amino acid sequences with M and L6 reveal that: (i) M1 contains four additional LRRs, probably as a result of an unequal crossover event between duplicated regions; (ii) M1 shares large segments of exact identity with M and M3, indicative of intragenic recombination events; and (iii) a large number of amino acid differences are scattered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9131026617753769051", "cites_id": ["9131026617753769051"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00563.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W5TZoVTst34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 8, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
