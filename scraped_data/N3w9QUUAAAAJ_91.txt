In the case of eukaryotic filamentous pathogens, such as fungi and oomycetes, effector proteins are typically dissimilar, at the protein sequence level, to known protein families and functional domains. Consequently, we currently have a limited understanding of how fungal and oomycete effectors promote disease. Protein biochemistry and structural biology are two methods that can contribute greatly to the understanding of protein function. Both techniques are dependent on obtaining proteins that are pure and functional, and generally require the use of heterologous recombinant protein expression systems. Here, we present a general scheme and methodology for the production and characterization of small cysteine\u2010rich \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7103643890640758376", "cites_id": ["7103643890640758376"], "pub_url": "https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mpp.12385", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aCaEWHs2lWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
