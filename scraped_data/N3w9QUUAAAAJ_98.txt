In this study a single copy avirulence gene, AvrP4, in the plant pathogen Melampsora lini, was used to investigate the evolution of such a gene across species. Partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha sequences were obtained to establish phylogenetic relationships among the Melampsora species. We amplified AvrP4 homologues from species pathogenic on hosts from different plant families and orders, across the inferred phylogeny. Translations of the AvrP4 sequences revealed a predicted signal peptide and towards the C-terminus of the protein, six identically spaced cysteines were identified in all sequences. Maximum likelihood analysis of synonymous versus non-synonymous substitution rates indicated that positive selection played a role in the evolution of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1465024069827188061", "cites_id": ["1465024069827188061"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2009.0328", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XVVyJaHPVBQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 9, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2}}
