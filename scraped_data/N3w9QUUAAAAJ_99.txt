The discovery and identification of these proteins has greatly expanded with the sequencing and annotation of fungal pathogen genomes. Studies to characterise effector function have revealed that a subset of these secreted pathogen proteins interact with plant proteins within the host cytoplasm. This review focuses on the effectors of intracellular biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal plant pathogens and summarises advances in understanding the roles of these proteins in disease and in elucidating the mechanism of fungal effector uptake into host cells."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "N3w9QUUAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17487007439281097206", "cites_id": ["17487007439281097206"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/FP10072", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9on2qp1UrvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
