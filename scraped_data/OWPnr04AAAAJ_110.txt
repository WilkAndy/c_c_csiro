With methyl methacrylate and styrene, the conversions of the polymerizations are relatively unaffected by the vinyl ethers. With methyl acrylate and vinyl acetate, however, some retardation occurs. The activity of the compounds is compared with that of \u03b1\u2010benzyloxystyrene (1), which undergoes chain transfer by a novel free radical addition\u2010fragmentation pathway."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11513962115632217705", "cites_id": ["11513962115632217705"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.1990.021910707", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:aT6QY4rPyZ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 4, "1996": 7, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
