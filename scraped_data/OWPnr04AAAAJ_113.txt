These effects arise from the RAFT\u2010induced exit of radicals, the desorption of the RAFT\u2010reinitiating radical from the particles, and the specificity of the reinitiating radical to the RAFT agent. Methods for reducing the inhibition period such as using a more hydrophobic reinitiating radical are predicted to show a significant improvement in the inhibition periods. The time\u2010dependent behavior of the RAFT adduct to the entering radical and the RAFT\u2010induced exit (loss) of radicals from particles are studied using a previously described Monte Carlo model of RAFT/emulsion particles. It is shown that an effective way of reducing the rate coefficient for the exit of radicals from the particles is to use a less active RAFT \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=689645773053997070", "cites_id": ["689645773053997070"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mats.200500052", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:DrC7Oy0dkgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
