The role of head-to-head linkages and unsaturated ends as defect structures in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is confirmed and the relative stability of these groups is established. The half-lives for oligo(methyl methacrylate) \u201cdecamers\u201d containing head-to-head and unsaturated linkages at 240\u00b0C in nitrogen are 72\u00b13 min. and 19\u00b12 min., respectively. Some limitations on Thermogravimetry when used for the quantitative analysis of PMMA are addressed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6088970949398650140", "cites_id": ["6088970949398650140"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01153444", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HF2UVtFegFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
