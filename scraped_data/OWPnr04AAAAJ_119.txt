The absolute rate constants for \u03b2-scission of tert-alkoxyl radicals, which vary over 4 orders of magnitude, indicate the vastly different behavior of alkoxyl radicals. However, the radical generation efficiencies of 1 varied only slightly, from 53 (R = Me) to 63% (R = But), supporting a mechanism involving concerted two-bond scission within the solvent cage to generate the tert-butyl radical, CO2, and an alkoxyl radical. The thermolysis rate constants of tert-alkyl peroxypivalates 1 were influenced by both inductive and steric effects [Taft\u2212Ingold equation, log(rel kd) = (0.97 \u00b1 0.14)\u03a3\u03c3* \u2212 (0.31 \u00b1 0.04)\u03a3Esc, was obtained].
