Vitamin D3 (D3) and la, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (l\u03b1,25-(OH)2-D3) were concurrently tested as dietary supplements in order to compare the potency of these three sterols. Growth, plasma calcium and phosphorus concentration, percentage bone ash, calcium absorption, and radiographic appearance of bone were determined after treatment of the chicks with the sterols for 3 weeks. l\u03b1-OH-D3 was 5.1, 3.4 and 3.7 times more potent than D3 in stimulating weight gain, maintenance of plasma calcium and promotion of increased percent bone ash, respectively. Radiographic examination of tibiae and femurs from the various groups revealed that l\u03b1-OH-D3 effectively mediates normal bone calcification; l\u03b1-OH-D3 was 2\u20136 times \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3668138354117507443", "cites_id": ["3668138354117507443"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/94/5/1337/2621886", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:c_koAGbY5zIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 6, "1978": 8, "1979": 0, "1980": 6, "1981": 4, "1982": 2, "1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
