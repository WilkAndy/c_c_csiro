The products were identified as hydroxy\u2010terminated poly(alkylene oxides) by 1H and 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy. The polymers were obtained in 66\u201381% yield from both catalysts in the polymerizations of 1,8\u2010octanediol and 1,10\u2010decanediol. With 1,6\u2010hexanediol the polymer yields were 30 and 42\u201056% in the presence of Nafion and sulphuric acid, respectively. These low yields were due to the formation of oxepane as confirmed by gas chromatographic analysis of volatile condensation products. Vapour pressure osmometry showed the number\u2010average molecular weight of polymers to be in the range 700\u20102400, depending on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16597975944351605088", "cites_id": ["16597975944351605088"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pi.4990270313", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YGGOeS7bV-YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 8, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
