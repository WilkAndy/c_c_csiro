Some retardation occurs with vinyl acetate and methyl acrylate.Ib also has the property of initiating the polymerization of methyl methacrylate photochemically, whileIIb acts as a thermal initiator. The chain transfer constants ofIIb make it particularly suitable for regulating molecular weight in batch polymerizations of methyl methacrylate and styrene."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15590960501493861716", "cites_id": ["15590960501493861716"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00587972", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VA2wvvg3XtgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
