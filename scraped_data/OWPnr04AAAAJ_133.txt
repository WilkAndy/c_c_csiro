The extent of the unimolecular reactions of the tert-alkoxyl radicals (versus addition to styrene) and the relative reactivity of alkyl radicals toward addition to styrene were obtained from the competitive addition/trapping reactions. The absolute rate constants for the addition of tert-butyl, ethyl, methyl, and n-propyl radicals to styrene at 60 \u00b0C were estimated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6304897982947805512", "cites_id": ["6304897982947805512"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo9707489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SEmuik9_f1cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
