The compounds examined were 2\u2010methyl\u20105\u2010methylene\u20101,3\u2010dithiane (5) (solid), 2\u2010methyl\u20106\u2010methylene\u20101,4\u2010dithiepane (6) (liquid), 6\u2010methyl\u20103\u2010methylene\u20101,5\u2010dithiacyclooctane (7) (liquid), and 6,8\u2010dimethyl\u20103\u2010methylene\u20101,5\u2010dithiacyclooctane (8) (liquid). The monomers were stable materials not requiring any special handling or storage conditions. They were polymerized in bulk using thermal azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, VAZO88) and photochemical initiators (Ciba DAROCUR 1173) and in benzene solutions (AIBN, 70 \u00b0C). The six\u2010membered ring monomer 5 was unreactive whereas seven\u2010membered ring monomer 6 polymerized to high conversion in bulk. In addition, 6 did not polymerize in benzene solution at 70 \u00b0C at [6] = 1.25 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3821745770892380998", "cites_id": ["3821745770892380998"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1099-0518(20010101)39:1%3C202::AID-POLA230%3E3.0.CO;2-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Rkvkt4eRCTUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
