The ratio of the individual catalyst components was investigated to achieve maximum conversion, stereoregularity, and molecular weight. It was found that the specific order of addition of catalyst components to the feedstock and aging time therein has critical influence in the polymerization reaction. This can be attributed to the rate of chlorinating the aluminoxane and the stability of the active catalyst sites obtained. \u00a9 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
