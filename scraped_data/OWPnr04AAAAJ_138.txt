Use of di-t-butyl peroxalate leads to the expected radical intermediates which are efficiently scavenged by the nitroxide. When benzoyl peroxide is used as initiator however, both ionic and radical processes are involved. The importance of electron-transfer processes is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18056686035175028747", "cites_id": ["18056686035175028747"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001430578990027X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Czhd00c8lvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
