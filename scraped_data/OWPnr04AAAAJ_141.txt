Extensive hydrogen abstraction as well as addition to both allyl and acryloyl double bonds was observed. One unusual feature of the reaction, the formation of considerably more (Z)- alkene than (E)- alkene from trapping of radicals derived from the allyloxy moiety, is also discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15964403119096513079", "cites_id": ["15964403119096513079"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch9850689", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:N8LixA30jN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 3, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 4, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
