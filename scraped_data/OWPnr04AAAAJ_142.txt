This activity was close to the ideal for obtaining narrow molecular\u2010weight distributions in batch polymerizations. The thionoester 3 showed no activity in polymerizations of methyl methacrylate, but was too reactive to be useful in vinyl acetate polymerizations. Ring\u2010substituted thionoesters 9\u201011 and 14 and 1H NMR spectroscopy of the resulting polymers were used to establish the type and quantity of end\u2010groups. The thionoester 12 was used to produce low\u2010molecular\u2010weight polystyrene that was terminated at one end with a hydroxy group and at the other end by a thioloester moiety."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6812108954631535155", "cites_id": ["6812108954631535155"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.1992.021930209", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:M_oRjAB5iV4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
