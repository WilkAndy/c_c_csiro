O-wherein n is as de fined in formula I above; or (iii) mixture of macrodiols comprising greater than 10% of a macrodiol as defined in formula I above;(B) an aliphatic or aromatic diisocyanate known in the art of polyurethane manufacture; and (C) optionally a chain extender."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8250865060584447694", "cites_id": ["8250865060584447694"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US5393858A/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zl7RwQ72gHIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
