Relative rates of double bond addition and of allylic hydrogen abstraction have been measured and are discussed, as are the relative stabilities of the products formed. The allylic radicals generated in these systems react with (1) mainly by coupling at the more substituted terminus of the radical \u03c0 system. Substituent effects on this regioselectivity may be explained in terms of the electrophilicity of (1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3619298098440104035", "cites_id": ["3619298098440104035"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH9831957", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y-jE1XFUOjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
