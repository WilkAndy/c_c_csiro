Thermolysis of 1 generated t-butyl and the corresponding t-alkoxyl radicals, i.e. 1,1,2-trimethylpropoxyl 2a and 1,1,2,2-tetramethylpropoxyl radicals 2b. Both t-alkoxyl radicals underwent very fast unimolecular processes (\u03b2-scission) essentially to the exclusion of intermolecular processes (addition and H-abstraction), in contrast to other t-alkoxyl radicals such as t-butoxyl radicals. The extent of \u03b2-scission of 2a and 2b to form alkyl radicals R\u00b7 were 97.6 and 99.7% in styrene and 98.4 and 99.7% in MMA, respectively. Alkyl radicals formed in the reaction then underwent selective tail addition to monomers or were trapped by the nitroxide.
