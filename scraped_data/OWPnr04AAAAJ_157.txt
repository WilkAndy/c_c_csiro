The method is based on cleavage of the tert-butyl ether with boron trichloride and analysis of the resulting tert-butyl chloride by gas-liquid chromatography. In polystyrene, tert-butoxy endgroups were also determined by dealkylation with trifluoroacetic acid, followed by reaction of the resulting hydroxy endgroups with o-sulfobenzoic anhydride and analysis for sulfonate by the dye-partition technique with methylene blue reagent. From these analyses it was possible to conclude that tert-butoxy radicals, derived from the decomposition of di-tert-butyl peroxalate (DBPOX), initiated styrene polymerization largely by direct addition, whereas in their reaction with methyl methacrylate (MMA) both direct addition and hydrogen abstraction from the monomer were important processes.
