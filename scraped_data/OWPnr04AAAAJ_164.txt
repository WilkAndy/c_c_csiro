For the reaction of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) with sulfuric acid in methyl methacrylate (MMA), the rate of initiation of polymer varies in a complex manner with the concentration of the components but is first-order in [tBHP] and approximately second-order in [H2SO4] at low concentrations of tBHP and in the presence of excess acid. At high concentrations of tBHP, chain transfer to unprotonated hydroperoxide retards the rate of polymerization. The rate of polymer initiation parallels the ionization ratio [BH+]/[B] of a weak base (B = 4-chloro-2-nitroaniline) in MMA-H2SO4 and the high order in [H2SO4] can be explained in terms of the requirement of more than one molecule of H2SO4 for the monoprotonation of the hydroperoxide \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13918275238627638569", "cites_id": ["13918275238627638569"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222338008063207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Kf2DXJalJ8EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 2, "1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2}}
