Thermolysis of 2 generated tert-butoxyl, tert-butyl, and methyl radicals in the ratios of 48:50:2 at 60 \u00b0C in 3. Both alkyl radicals underwent selective tail addition to 3. tert-Butyl radicals reacted about twice as fast as methyl radicals with 3. The absolute rate constant for addition of tert-butyl radicals to 3 was estimated to be 2.3 \u00d7 106 M-1 s-1 at 60 \u00b0C. The overall ratio of addition to H abstraction in the reaction of 2 with 3 was 5:1.
