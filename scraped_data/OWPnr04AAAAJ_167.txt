The specimens  that were subjected to 3 months of implantation were strained to 250% of their resting length, while those implanted for 6 months had no applied external strain. SEM examination of the explanted specimens revealed that the novel materials displayed resistance to environmental stress cracking.  Proprietary materials, Pellethane 2363-80A, Biomer and Tecoflex EG-80A, which had been implanted under identical conditions, showed evidence of significant stress cracking. The extent of stress cracking in the 3-month strained experiment was similar to that from the 6-month unstrained experiment.  Stress cracking was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10850267713481166410", "cites_id": ["10850267713481166410"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1163/156856295X00742", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Sk7vi__kk5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
