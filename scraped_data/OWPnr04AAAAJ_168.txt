On irradiation cis-a, 4-di% nitrostilbene (1) yields the N-oxide (4), for which we have no direct evidence, which then breaks down to give bensaldehyde and p-nitrobensonitrile oxide. These products then combine in a 1, 3 dipolar addition to yield the dioxazole (3). p-Nitrobenzoic acid probably arises by hydrolysis of the nitrile oxide under the acid conditions which develop during the photolysis, or from the dioxazole, shown to yield the acid under the irradiation conditions. There is analogy for the formation of the N-oxide (4) in the recent photochemical conversion of an o&unsaturated ketone to an oxetene 13, and in the proposed intermediacy of an oxasetbne in the photochemical breakdown of an acetylenic nitrite to a nitrile and a lactone 14. Two further examples of this nitroolefin fragmentation have been found.
