An explanation for bimodal molecular weight distributions observed when making high molecular weight acrylic polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn\u22641.1) at high conversion involves copolymerization of the macromonomer formed by backbiting-\u03b2-scission. Evidence for this mechanism is provided. RAFT copolymerization is illustrated by the synthesis of novel copolymer intercalants/ exfoliants/dispersants for unmodified layered silicates (sodium montmorillonite) in polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites. Block and gradient copolymers were prepared based on a long chain acrylate (e.g. octadecyl acrylate, ODA) and various polar comonomers (e.g. acrylic acid, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, maleic anhydride, methacrylic acid, N-vinyl pyrrolidone)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1935494178989434899", "cites_id": ["1935494178989434899"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2006-0944.ch035", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E2iAe7NB3BoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
