The resulting copolymers contained blocks of homo-poly(MDTO), even at low MDTO feed ratios. Changes in temperature and monomer concentration have a significant effect on the copolymer composition of methyl methacrylate\u2212MDTO and styrene\u2212MDTO mixtures and therefore on the apparent reactivity ratios. The magnitude of the concentration effect is independent of the solvent. A new copolymerization mechanism is proposed in which the addition of an MDTO radical to the comonomer is reversible while all other propagation reactions are effectively irreversible. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of such a mechanism. Parameters for MDTO\u2212M2 (M2 = STY, MMA) according to this model are reported as (rMDTO, r2, k-12/k \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14690275612506436579", "cites_id": ["14690275612506436579"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0020584", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:47MHUNZX3ssJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
