The predominant unimolecular reactions of 3, that is, \u03b2-scission to form neopentyl radicals (14b) and a 1,5-H shift to form 4-hydroxy-2,2,4-trimethylpentyl radicals (14c), were observed in both monomer systems. The resulting alkyl radicals underwent selective addition to the two monomers. The relative reactivities of the alkyl radicals toward addition to the monomers were obtained from competitive addition/trapping reactions. The absolute rate constants for the addition of alkyl radicals 14b and 14c to the two monomers at 60 \u00b0C were estimated to be 9.5 \u00d7 105 and 2.6 \u00d7 105 M-1 s-1 to MMA and 4 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5883521212707497034", "cites_id": ["5883521212707497034"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja972240t", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SuTn5153plEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
