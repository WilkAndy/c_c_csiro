The major reaction pathways of the alkoxyl radicals were \u03b2-scission and rearrangement (1,5-H shift) to generate alkyl radicals, which occurred to the extent of 83% (3b) and 90% (3c), respectively. The resulting alkyl radicals underwent selective addition to MMA. The overall ratios of addition to H-abstraction in the reactions of 3b and of 3c with MMA were 13:1 and 24:1, respectively. From the competitive addition/trap reactions of alkyl radicals, relative reactivities of alkyl radicals toward addition to MMA were in the ratio:\u2009 Et\u2022:n-Pr\u2022:4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl radical:But\u2022 = 0.39 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2329368671946019785", "cites_id": ["2329368671946019785"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma9615765", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yRNEMneUUyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
