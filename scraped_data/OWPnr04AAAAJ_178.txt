Mark\u2212Houwink\u2212Sakurada (MHS) constants for poly(MDTO) were found to be K = 23 \u00d7 10-5 dL g-1 and \u03b1 = 0.67. Using these parameters, chain transfer constants were obtained at 60 \u00b0C and are reported as 0.13 (BuSH), 0.19 (BuSSBu), and 0.0025 (BuSBu). These values are compared to the corresponding chain transfer constants obtained for styrene (STY) and methyl methacrylate (MMA). Subsequently, the chain transfer activity was measured over a range of temperatures (40\u221280 \u00b0C), and Arrhenius parameters were determined. Significant differences in chain transfer activity between carbon- and sulfur-centered radicals were observed. In addition, the extent of transfer to monomer was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17720146191808804990", "cites_id": ["17720146191808804990"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0010579", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:fjjBehOb6vUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
