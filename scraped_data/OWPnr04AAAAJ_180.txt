The mechanisms of initiation and termination can only be defined with a knowledge of the structures and relative proportions of these groups. The identification and estimation of end groups is, however, difficult because of their low overall concentration. We have previously2) reported a 13C NMR technique, based on the inversionhecovery sequence, for the identification of end groups in low molecular weight polymers. The low inherent sensitivity of the 13C nucleus in NMR measurements restricts this method to low molecular weight polymers. The problem has been overcome in one instance3) by the use of a labelled initiator. We now report an NMR technique which allows the identification of the end groups in high molecular weight polymers, even when the signals of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4521409317364453209", "cites_id": ["4521409317364453209"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.1983.030040107", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:WU-mldFFvz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 2, "1985": 4, "1986": 0, "1987": 2, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1}}
