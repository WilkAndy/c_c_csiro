A further aspect of the invention is the Subsequent modification of the thin film composite polyamide membrane by controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP) to yield membranes having new chemical and physical properties, eg antifouling and/or antibacterial properties. Further aspects of the invention are the functionalized thin film composite (TFC) polyamide membranes on the microporous Substrate itself and the mem branes modified by controlled free radical polymerization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5715165831431573322", "cites_id": ["5715165831431573322"], "pub_url": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US8544658B2/en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Ss_tHgtZUE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
