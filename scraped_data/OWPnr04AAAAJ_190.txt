Thus, 2\u2010cyanoprop\u20102\u2010yl dithiobenzoate on treatment with diazomethane at room temperature provided a mixture of stereoisomeric 1,3\u2010dithiolanes in near quantitative (>95%) yield. A low\u2010molecular\u2010weight RAFT\u2010synthesized poly(methyl methacrylate) with dithiobenzoate end\u2010groups underwent similar reaction as indicated by immediate decolourization and a quantitative doubling of molecular weight. Higher\u2010molecular\u2010weight poly(methyl methacrylate)s were also rapidly decolourized by diazomethane and provided a product with a bimodal molecular weight distribution. Under similar conditions, the trithiocarbonate group does not react with diazomethane."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18383828381695551197", "cites_id": ["18383828381695551197"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch10471", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3Sa17oJ6IP8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
