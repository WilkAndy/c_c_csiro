Allylic hydrogen abstraction was shown to compete with addition to the double bond at the CH2 group. The proportion of abstraction relative to addition increases with increasing solvent polarity, however, this effect is more pronounced in the reactions of isopropenyl acetate than in those of \u03b1\u2010methylstyrene."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17284930302314511585", "cites_id": ["17284930302314511585"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.1984.021850903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4XzXzIdo4O8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 6, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
