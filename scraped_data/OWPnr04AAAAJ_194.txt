A molecular weight series of polyethylene glycols was attached to the surface hydroxyls, using a urethane linker, by reaction with toluene 2,4\u2010diisocyanate. The change in the surface was monitored and the surface products identified using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscoy (DRIFTS) and solid\u2010state carbon\u201013 NMR spectroscopy. The strength of attachment was evaluated by extraction with solvents for urethanes and poly(ethylene oxides). The surface coverage of polymer chains was quantified using a combination of two methods. Potentiometric titration was used to determine the amount of urethane formed on the surface and the number of terminal isocyanate groups available for subsequent reaction with the hydroxy\u2010terminated polymer.
