The chain\u2010transfer constants for these compounds at 60 \u00b0C were 0.38 (PhSH), 0.76 (BzSH), 0.24 (PhSSPh), and 0.05 (BzSSBz). The variations in the thiol chain\u2010transfer constants could be explained in terms of the stability of the resulting radicals. The chain transfer to the disulfides, however, appeared to be determined by the electronic character of the disulfide bond, and this suggests that the transfer took place via an addition\u2013fragmentation mechanism. \u00a9 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
