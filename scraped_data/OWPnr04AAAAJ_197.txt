MDTO was also copolymerized with styrene (STY) under the same conditions. Reactivity ratios in bulk monomer at 25 \u00b0C, based on the terminal model, were determined from 1H NMR analyses of the copolymers as rMDTP = 0.85, rMMA = 11 (MDTP\u2212MMA); rMDTO = 1.22, rMMA = 3.08 (MDTO\u2212MMA); and rMDTO = 0.3, rSTY = 8.6 (MDTO\u2212STY). The average propagation rate coefficients, \u27e8kp\u27e9, were determined for the copolymerizations in the monomer composition ranges 0 \u2264 fMDTP \u2264 0.6 (MDTP\u2212MMA), 0 \u2264 fMDTO \u2264 0.4 (MDTO\u2212MMA) and 0 \u2264 fMDTO \u2264 0.3 (MDTO\u2212STY). It was not possible to obtain values for \u27e8kp\u27e9 from mixtures containing higher mole fractions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2423454482997428257", "cites_id": ["2423454482997428257"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0111663", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IcBjJAPXoSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
