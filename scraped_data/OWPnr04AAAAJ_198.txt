The important advantages over chlorosulfonic acid, previously employed in the dye-partition analysis for the conversion of hydroxy into sulfate groups, are that o-sulfobenzoic anhydride does not react at sites other than the hydroxy functionality and that it introduces the dye-active moiety (sulfonate) into the polymer via a hydrolytically more stable linkage."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1703042577484079563", "cites_id": ["1703042577484079563"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222337908066623", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y-FNfDNsohcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 3, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 3, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
