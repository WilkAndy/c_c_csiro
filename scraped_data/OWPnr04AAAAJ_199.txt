We report the successful use of switchable RAFT agents for controlling the polymerization of N,N-dimethylacrylamide in aqueous media and the dependence of RAFT agent activity on acid type and acid strength. For best results a stoichiometric amount of a strong acid should be used. We describe new RAFT agents (N-aryl-N-(4-pyridinyl) dithiocarbamates, aryl trithiocarbonates). We assess the for scope for RAFT single unit monomer insertion and describe its application in the synthesis of block copolymers containing organic semiconductor segments. Finally we briefly summarize methods of transforming RAFT synthesized polymers and disclose a potential click process based on successive 1,3-doplar addition steps for quantitatively transforming RAFT end groups."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2063817471096732021", "cites_id": ["2063817471096732021"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2012-1100.ch016", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dTn3LQ4npBwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
