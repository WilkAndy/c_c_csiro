With allyl acrylate, extensive H-abstraction as well as addition to both allyl and acryloyl double bonds was observed whereas with diallyl ether, the only products obtained were derived exclusively from H-abstraction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2757505156476309792", "cites_id": ["2757505156476309792"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1988/p1/p19880000485", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IBEUdlSgRCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
