This new material was obtained by combining Suzuki polycondensation with radical addition fragmentation chain transfer. The block copolymer was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, and optical spectroscopy methods. Photophysical data for (F6T2\u2010b\u2010PS(C60)) and a related block copolymer (F6T2\u2010b\u2010PS(PCBM)) (PCBM, phenyl\u2010C61\u2010butyric acid methyl ester) are reported and their performance as compatibilizers in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells is assessed. It is demonstrated that the addition of the rod\u2013coil block copolymers to the active layer extends the operational stability of organic photovoltaic devices. \u00a9 2015 Wiley \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17590519227886832185", "cites_id": ["17590519227886832185"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pola.27514", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OYrfCAoUHvQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
