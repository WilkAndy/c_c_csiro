When the active\u2010center concentration was determined by the number\u2010average molecular weight technique, it was found that the percentage of active cobalt depended on the Al/Co ratio. Subsequently, an equilibrium reaction was proposed to be Co + 2Al \u21cc CoAl2, where Co is cobalt(II) octanoate, Al is either of the aluminum alkyl\u2010activator species, and CoAl2 is the active catalyst. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
