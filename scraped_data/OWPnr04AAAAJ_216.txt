In particular, initiator-derived end groups can have profound effects on the stability of the polymer toward thermal and/or photochemical degradation. 1 The nitroxide radical trapping technique, employing 1, 1, 3, 3-tetramethyl-2, 3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yloxyl (1) as a scavenger, has been used extensively to elucidate initiation mechanisms in free radical polymerization. 2 Griffiths et al. studied the reaction of tert-butoxyl radicals 3a with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and reported that 3a underwent not only addition to MMA but also hydrogen abstraction from MMA in significant proportion (33%). 3 This indicates that 3a is a potent hydrogen abstractor and tert-butoxyl radical initiation introduces a considerable amount of unsaturated end groups in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18194922011203821843", "cites_id": ["18194922011203821843"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ma9611127", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:E2G9GStZgfwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
