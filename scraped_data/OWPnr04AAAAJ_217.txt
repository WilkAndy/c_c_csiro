It is suggested that for both compounds the major primary photo-product is the corresponding aci-nitro tautomer, which then undergoes further reactions depending mainly on the conditions employed. The aci-nitro compounds are believed to be formed by a 1,5-hydrogen shift from C4 to oxygen, and their intermediacy is supported by the formation of a mixture of 6\u03b1-deutero-6\u03b2-nitrocholest-4-ene and 6\u03b2-deutero-6\u03b1- nitrocholest-4-ene on irradiation of 6-nitrocholest-5-ene in Me3COD.    Several other reactions of 3\u03b2-acetoxy-6-nitrocholest-5-ene and 6- nitrocholest-5-ene are described."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13322263626648407439", "cites_id": ["13322263626648407439"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH9780097", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:j018Hi8w4rgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 2, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1}}
