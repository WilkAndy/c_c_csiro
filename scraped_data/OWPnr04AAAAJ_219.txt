Besides, it offers all advantages of conventional free radical polymerization. The polymerization is carried out in the presence of thiocarbonylthio compounds of general structure ZC (= S) SR and results in the formation of end-functionalized polymers. 1 Poly (N-hydroxysuccinimide methacrylate) is widely used in the synthesis of watersoluble block copolymers for polymer-drug conjugation. 2 The drug is bound to the polymer via a hydrolizable oligopeptide linker, which in turn is bound to the polymer through the reaction of the N-hydroxysuccinimide moiety (Scheme 1). If LCST polymers are sequentially copolymerized with functional monomers, such as N-hydroxysuccinimide methacrylate, short blocks are obtained which provide binding sites for the amino functions of proteins."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=385941619610152126", "cites_id": ["385941619610152126"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/San-Thang/publication/225033676_Controlled_radical_polymerization_of_N-isopropylacrylamide_and_of_activated_esters_for_the_synthesis_of_polymer-protein_and_polymer-drug_conjugates/links/0046353b79dd6454d1000000/Controlled-radical-polymerization-of-N-isopropylacrylamide-and-of-activated-esters-for-the-synthesis-of-polymer-protein-and-polymer-drug-conjugates.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:vuzmtNsjWwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
