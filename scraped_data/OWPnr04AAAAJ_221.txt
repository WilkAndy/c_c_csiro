Macromonomers of general structure 1 have been prepared by utilizing appropriately substituted allylic sulfides as chain transfer agents in free radical polymerizations. Preliminary experiments have shown that a polystyrene macromonomer (1, R = Ph) copolymerizes efficiently with ethyl acrylate."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13267942406986628306", "cites_id": ["13267942406986628306"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-84115-6_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:0nzHlFIzIbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2}}
