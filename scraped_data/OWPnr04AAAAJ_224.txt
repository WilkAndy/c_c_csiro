The process is living and uses simple organic compounds having a thiocarbonyl thio function to control the polymerization, which otherwise is similar to a conventional free radical polymerization. The review will detail the mechanistic aspects of the process and the use of the method to prepare narrow polydispersity polymers of defined molecular weight and a variety of architectures. A set of guidelines to select the appropriate RAFT agent, the rationale behind such a selection, depending on the monomer to be polymerized, will also be included."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11077122437979998939", "cites_id": ["11077122437979998939"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roshan-Mayadunne/publication/267214124_MECHANISTIC_AND_PRACTICAL_ASPECTS_OF_RAFT_POLYMERIZATION/links/54487e3b0cf22b3c14e31160/MECHANISTIC-AND-PRACTICAL-ASPECTS-OF-RAFT-POLYMERIZATION.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:24pOESvYuZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
