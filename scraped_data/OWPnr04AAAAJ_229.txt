The kinetic data show that the decomposition rate constant of 1b is about three times higher than that of tert-butyl peroxypivalate. The radical trapping technique employing 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yloxyl has been used to study the decomposition mechanism of 1b. The results show that the thermolysis of 1b in cumene generates tert-butyl radicals exclusively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4847425680233305667", "cites_id": ["4847425680233305667"], "pub_url": "https://www.journal.csj.jp/doi/abs/10.1246/cl.1997.1093", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Q5ZpMfmDRUMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
