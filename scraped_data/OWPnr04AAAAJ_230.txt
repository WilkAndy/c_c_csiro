The mechanism of the light-induced formation of the corresponding \u03b1, \u03b2- unsaturated ketone , which may accompany deconjugation , has also been examined. Support for a scheme involving \u03b3-hydrogen abstraction to give an unsaturated nitronic acid, followed by N- hydroxyoxaziridine formation and collapse to the ketone, is provided in the photochemistry of the stable nitronic acids, 4-t-butyl-aci-nitrocyclohexane (17) and 9-aci-nitrofluorene (18). Syntheses of the nitro olefins (6), (7), (12), (15) and (27), and the nitronic acid (17) are also reported."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12016907530490976032", "cites_id": ["12016907530490976032"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH9851505", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IJehDbuhxKYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
