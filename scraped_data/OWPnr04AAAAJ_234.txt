This contribution demonstrates the attributes of the RAFT process as a ground-breaking technology offering unprecedented control over the composition, functionality and architecture of polymers obtained through radical polymerization. Examples of block copolymer structures with distinctive physical and chemical properties are presented and the performance attributes of these polymers are highlighted."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4506127739120866757", "cites_id": ["4506127739120866757"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2013-1148.ch010", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xVXV4k37iD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
