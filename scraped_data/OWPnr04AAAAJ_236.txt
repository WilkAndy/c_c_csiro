The propagation rates were reduced by 50% with the inclusion of 18 mM mesitylene or 0.17 mM trimethoxybenzene. Mesitylene was found to be an inefficient polymerization regulator because it reduced the propagation rate by a combination of regulation and destruction of the active catalyst complex. Not only did trimethoxybenzene reduce the propagation rate by effective regulation at low concentration, it also increased the percentage activity of cobalt to 200%, indicating that two polymer chains were propagating simultaneously from each active center. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
