All the materials were thermally processable at 120\u2013160\u00b0C except one that was solvent\u2010castable. Mechanical properties and hydrolytic stability (at neutral pH) were found to depend on the macrodiol and chain extender. Poly(tetramethylene oxide)\u2010based polyetherurethaneureas that were chain\u2010extended with primary aliphatic diamines, other than 1,3\u2010propanediamine, exhibited significantly better mechanical properties than those chain\u2010extended with secondary aliphatic or aromatic diamines.
