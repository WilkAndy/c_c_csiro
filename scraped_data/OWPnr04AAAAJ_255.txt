The introduction of electron-rich thiophene units to BDT raises the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the conjugated polymer and the concomitant reduction of the bandgap enhances the harvesting of solar radiation. This modification also introduces less sterically demanding triple bonds, thereby potentially enabling more favourable molecular interactions and an extra dimension of conjugation perpendicular to the main polymer chain. The optoelectronic properties of this new conjugated polymer were evaluated using UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy in air, photo-induced charge extraction \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:BrOSOlqYqPUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13107488162690577879", "cites_id": ["13107488162690577879"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/ch15457", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:1zXPmgkn57UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
