Diels-Alder adducts were confirmed between partially dehydrochlorinated PVC and dihexadecylmaleate and dioctadecylmaleate both in solution and under extrusion processing conditions by 1H n.m.r. and i.r. spectroscopy. The 1H n.m.r. spectra allowed an estimation of the degree of incorporation of the maleate groups."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2382427120735847188", "cites_id": ["2382427120735847188"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0032386189901304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FIO3-tcUECEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
