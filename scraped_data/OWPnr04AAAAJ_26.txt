Use of 1-phenylethyl phenyldithioacetate (1-PEPDTA) produced well-defined polymers with molecular weights close to those predicted from theory, up to conversions of 30%. The mechanism of polymerization was examined and shown to proceed via reversible addition\u2212fragmentation chain transfer, as opposed to reversible termination with a thiocarbonylthiyl radical. UV-induced decomposition of the dithioester moiety in 1-PEPDTA and 1-phenylethyl dithiobenzoate (1-PEDB) mediated RAFT polymerizations was followed using UV/vis spectrophotometry; 1-PEPDTA decomposed much slower than 1-PEDB. Analysis of the decomposition products of 1-PEPDTA with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to elucidate a possible mechanism for its degradation, suggesting that both 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 351, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10409594098798790177", "cites_id": ["10409594098798790177"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0204296", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IYbnMq5OdpAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 12, "2004": 10, "2005": 9, "2006": 13, "2007": 19, "2008": 19, "2009": 18, "2010": 17, "2011": 16, "2012": 16, "2013": 14, "2014": 26, "2015": 16, "2016": 22, "2017": 24, "2018": 16, "2019": 15, "2020": 21, "2021": 20, "2022": 18, "2023": 7}}
