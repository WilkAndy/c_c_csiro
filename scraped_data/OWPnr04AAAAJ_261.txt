Comparable amounts of cyclohexyl radicals and t-butyl radicals were generated from the thermolysis of 1a. Thus, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethoxyl radicals 2a undergo \u03b2-scission exclusively. The efficiency of radical generation for 1a was determined to be 0.56, which is slightly higher than that for t-butyl peroxypivalate (0.53)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10954336088000203586", "cites_id": ["10954336088000203586"], "pub_url": "https://www.journal.csj.jp/doi/abs/10.1246/cl.1998.965", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qot-K6KeBZgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2}}
