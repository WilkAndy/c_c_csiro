RAFT polymerization has been a success; there are now more than 10\u2009000 publications and over 1000 patent families that relate to the understanding, development, and/or application of the technique, and the rate of publication shows no signs of waning. Although some might argue that RAFT is now a mature technique, there are significant efforts striving for a more complete understanding of the mechanism and further expanding the scope of the process. The success of these endeavours to date can be gauged by comparing the contents of the book with that of the 2008 \u2018Handbook of RAFT Polymerization.\u2019 The optimism expressed in the chapters show that RAFT polymerization will \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:yeL6HyUMUGUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7356214234667065251", "cites_id": ["7356214234667065251"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527821358.ch1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:o58AHd-FFmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
