The structure of 13 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. A \u03b2-fragmentation mechanism is suggested for the oxidative ring-opening reaction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:zdjWy_NXXwUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10680565662950833011", "cites_id": ["10680565662950833011"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH17203", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cztr5OH9OJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
