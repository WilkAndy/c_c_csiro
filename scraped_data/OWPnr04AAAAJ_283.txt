RAFT polymerization is an extremely versatile process. There is compatibility with a wide range of functionality in monomers, solvents and initiators. It can be applied to form narrow polydispersity polymers or copolymers from most monomers amenable to radical polymerization. It is possible to take RAFT polymerizations to high conversion and achieve commercially acceptable polymerization rates. Various complex architectures such as stars, blocks, microgel and hyperbranched structures, supramolecular assemblies are readily accessible. These features of RAFT Polymerization are described in recent reviews. This paper will discuss recent advances relevant to improved nanostructured materials:(1) approaches to stereochemical control through polymerization in the presence of Lewis Acids;(2) methods of thiocarbonylthio end group removal or transformation;(3) approaches to the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:eI34FqJmdUoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7287220001801531537", "cites_id": ["7287220001801531537"], "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/advances-in-raft-polymerization-improved-nanostrucured-materials", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kXCAd_tnIWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
