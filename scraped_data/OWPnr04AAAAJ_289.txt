The polymerizations use addition-fragmentation chain transfer agents (RAFT agents) that possess high transfer coefficients in free radical polymerization and confer living character on the polymerization. This paper explores the effect of the substituents R of dithiobenzoate RAFT agents [SdC (Ph) SR] on the outcome of polymerizations of styrene, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl (BA) or methyl acrylate (MA). In MMA polymerization at 60 C, effectiveness depends strongly on R decreasing in the order where R is:-C (Alkyl) 2CN\u223c-C (Me) 2Ar>-C (Me) 2C (dO) O (alkyl)>-C (Me) 2C (dO) NH (alkyl)>-C (Me) 2CH2C (Me) 3 g-C (Me) HPh>-C (Me) 3\u223c-CH2Ph. Of these, only the compounds with R)-C (Me) 2Ph and-C (Me) 2CN provided polymers with substantially narrowed polydispersities in batch polymerization and gave molecular weight control of the form expected for a living polymerization. These compounds have high transfer coefficients in MMA polymerization (transfer coefficient> 20 for 0.003 M RAFT agent in bulk MMA). Reagents with R)-C (Me) 2C (dO) O (alkyl), C (Me) 2C (dO) NH (alkyl),-C (Me) 2CH2C (Me) 3,-C (Me) HPh,-C (Me) 3, and-CH2Ph appear relatively ineffective in MMA polymerization because they have much lower transfer coefficients (ca. 1.7, 0.7, 0.4, 0.15, 0.03, and 0.03 respectively). In polymerizations of styrene or acrylates at 60 C, transfer coefficients of RAFT agents are several orders of magnitude \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1407762313393605037", "cites_id": ["1407762313393605037"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/46303130/Thiocarbonylthio_compounds_SCPhS-R_in_20160607-12338-2cq3n5.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rQkCil1giRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
