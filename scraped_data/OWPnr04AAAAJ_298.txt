Polyurethane-ureas prepared from the diisocyanate TMXDI (m-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate), however, show decreased stability. In vivo subcutaneous implant experiments (sheep; 90 days and 180 days), show that the new MDI-based ether-reduced polyurethanes do not undergo stress cracking while the PTMO-based materials do. The TMXDI materials performed poorly when implanted."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:yMeIxYmEMEAC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11037704070106289374", "cites_id": ["11037704070106289374"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=CT7tCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA213&dq=info:3pSRGl_NLZkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=LKcGv-9HZQ&sig=_YURJHu7T6t7LhXoOvcitcXuVqk", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3pSRGl_NLZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1}}
