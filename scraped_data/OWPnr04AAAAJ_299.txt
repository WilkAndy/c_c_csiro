The linking process or polymerization is generally carried out by \"opening\" a double bond, opening a ring, or by using molecules bearing two or more reactive functional groups. Polymerization process are two distinct types: chain growth (also referred to as chain reaction or addition polymerization) and step growth (also referred to as step reaction or condensation polymerization). The major distinctions between the two result from the differences in the kinetics of the polymerization reaction. The chapter is an attempt to provide a concise overview of polymer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3770891838190534730", "cites_id": ["3770891838190534730"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3770891838190534730&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:SkDE1SXmVDQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1}}
