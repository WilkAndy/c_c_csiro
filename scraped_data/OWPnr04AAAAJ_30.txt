The RAFT process is accomplished by performing a conventional radical polymerization in the presence of a (thiocarbonyl) sulfanyl compound of general structure SdC (Z)-SR (1)(eg, 2-phenylprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate, 1a) that acts as an efficient reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer agent (a RAFT agent) and confers living characteristics onto the polymerization. A major advantage of the RAFT process over other methods for living radical polymerization is its compatibility with a wide range of functional monomers, for example, methacrylic acid, styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, or 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate. The products, whether homopolymers, random copolymers, gradient, or block copolymers, are of controlled molecular weight and generally have very narrow polydispersities (usually< 1.2, sometimes< 1.1). 11-14"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 281, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11023579580045205945", "cites_id": ["11023579580045205945"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/83716165/MoadRizzardo_20RAFT_20ESR.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:uSHY_Tif-5gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 6, "2001": 14, "2002": 22, "2003": 26, "2004": 26, "2005": 24, "2006": 21, "2007": 19, "2008": 24, "2009": 13, "2010": 12, "2011": 10, "2012": 13, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 12, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
