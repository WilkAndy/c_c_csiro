This is no doubt due to the instability of these compounds, especially non-conjugated ones, which are required for a study of the photochemistry of the isolated chromophore.We have now found that 4-t-butyl-aci-nitrocyclohexane'(1)[mp 115-117 dec.,~~ xx\"\" 234 run (E 9400),\u201c; 2\u2019 2800-2300 and 1657 cm-'], which is readily prepared from a mixture of cie-and trcuzs-4-t-butylnitrocyclohexane', is remarkably stable, being unchanged after keeping at room temperature for several weeks. The only nitronic acids of similar stability reported so far are stabilised either by conjugation or by the presence of bulky neighbouring groups'. Although unstable in protic solvents,(1) could be recovered unchanged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13550907537308821014", "cites_id": ["13550907537308821014"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13550907537308821014&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:FqZ0AZx-DrwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 1}}
