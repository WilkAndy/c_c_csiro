A variety of processes have now been reported for thiocarbonylthio-group modification. These include reactions with nucleophiles, radicalinduced reactions, thermolysis, electrocyclic reactions and \u201cclick\u201d processes. We also 10 consider the use of RAFT-synthesized polymers in the construction of block or graft copolymers, functional nanoparticles and biopolymer conjugates where transformation of the thiocarbonylthio-group is an integral part of the process. This includes the use of RAFT-synthesized polymers in other forms of radical polymerization such as ATRP or NMP, and the \u201cswitching\u201d of thiocarbonylthio-groups to enable control over polymerization of a wider 15 range of monomers in the RAFT process."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1788965783396692447", "cites_id": ["1788965783396692447"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP102281&dsid=DS3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:3zGw0uau0xgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
