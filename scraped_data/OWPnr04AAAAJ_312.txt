Thus, 2-cyanoprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate on treatment of with diazomethane at room temperature provided stereoisomeric 1, 3-dithiolanes in near quantitative (95%) yield. A low molecular weight RAFT-synthesized poly (methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) with dithiobenzoate end groups underwent similar reaction as indicated by immediate decolorization and a quantitative doubling of molecular weight. Higher molecular weight PMMA were also rapidly decolorized by diazomethane and provided a product with a bimodal molecular weight distribution. Under similar conditions, the trithiocarbonate group does not react with diazomethane."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:0aBXIfxlw9sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP106720&sb=RECENT&n=43&rpp=50&page=69&tr=5045&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "cites_per_year": {}}
