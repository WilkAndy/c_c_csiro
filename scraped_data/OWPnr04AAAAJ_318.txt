The process is living and uses simple organic compounds having a thiocarbonyl thio function to control the polymerization, which otherwise is similar to a conventional free radical polymerization. The review will detail the mechanistic aspects of the process and the use of the method to prepare narrow polydispersity polymers of defined molecular weight and a variety of architectures. A set of guidelines to select the appropriate RAFT agent, the rationale behind such a selection, depending on the monomer to be polymerized, will also be included."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=sfVq6CYqIzAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA65&dq=info:If1msVJcX80J:scholar.google.com&ots=k4quVO955J&sig=roa01TXLOomQQ1lOgGZhseL8e04", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:If1msVJcX80J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
