These polymers have ruthenium polybipyridine moieties as the energy trap cores and styrene functionalized coumarin monomers as the light absorbing antenna chromophores. The polymers have been made by reversible additionfragmentation chain transfer RAFT polymerisation using di- or hexafunctional ruthenium-containing RAFT agents. The resulting ruthenium-containing polymers have narrow molecular weight distribution polydispersity < 1.1 and exhibit energy transfer efficiencies of up to 60 between the coumarin donor dyes and the ruthenium acceptor chromophores."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:QsKbpXNoaWkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12098427332246908615&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
