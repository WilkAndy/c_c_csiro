The outcomes of these experimental conditions are seen to be quite different, with the improved experimental"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:hGdtkIFZdKAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://nanonanonano.net/projects/RAFT/thesis/pdf/05chapter04.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Mo_JxwqFgRoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
