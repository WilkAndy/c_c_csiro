Degradation in these tests was compared to degradation of the same materials in an ovine in vivo accelerated test in which polyurethane dumbbells were stretched over poly (methyl methacrylate) holders to a constant strain and implanted for 90 days subcutaneously. Further samples of the same materials were implanted unstressed for 6 months. Degradation in both in vitro and in vivo accelerated tests was correlated with degradation observed in the 6 month in vivo study. The in vitro test is suitable for initial screening of novel polyurethanes. The accelerated in vivo model generated environmental stress cracking in 90 days and was able to discriminate between materials of differing biostability. Three of the novel materials studied were more biostable than the commercial materials. The accelerated in vivo model provides a technique to identify materials which are more biostable than existing commercial polyurethanes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:HGTzPopzzJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17091214823819883568&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
