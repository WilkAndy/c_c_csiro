In the present work, results of a detailed study of the mechanism of reaction of allyl acrylate (2, AA) and of allyl methacrylate (3, AMA) with tert-butoxy radicals in the presence of (1) is reported. These acrylates are'difunctional'monomers of commercial importance as crosslinking agents in the manufacture of polymers. The main aim of this work was to compare the reactivity of allylic and acryloyl functions (in the same molecule) with tert-butoxy radicals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:wUn16MOA3RoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/characterization-of-initiation-in-the-free-radical-polymerization", "cites_per_year": {}}
