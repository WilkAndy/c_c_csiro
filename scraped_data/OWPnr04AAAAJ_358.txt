Although relatively stable to acid, the enol ether may be hydrolysed to yield the triketone, a mixture of two stable tautomers, which may be separated readily by fractional crystallisation. Structures have been assigned to the two tautomers on spectroscopic evidence."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1972/p1/p19720001358", "cites_per_year": {}}
