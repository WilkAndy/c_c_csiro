It is one of the most versatile processes for conferring living characteristics on radical polymerization. 1 Most monomers that can be polymerized by radical polymerization are able to be controlled via the RAFT process.However, the control that a RAFT agent (ZC (= S) SR) is able to impart upon a polymerization is dependent on which monomer (s) are used. RAFT agents suitable for controlling polymerization of the \u2018more-activated\u2019monomers (MAMs)(eg acrylate and styrenic monomers) inhibit or retard polymerizations of the \u2018less activated\u2019monomers (LAMs)(eg vinyl esters and amides). Alternately, RAFT agents suitable for controlling polymerizations of LAMs tend to be inert to radical addition during polymerization of MAMs, making them ineffective control agents. For these reasons the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11097410126930993250&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:YmCLvrbrAZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
