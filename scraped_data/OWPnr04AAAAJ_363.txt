Thus, 2-cyanoprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate on treatment of with diazomethane at room temperature provided stereoisomeric 1, 3-dithiolanes in near quantitative (> 95%) yield. A low molecular weight RAFT-synthesized poly (methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) with dithiobenzoate end-groups underwent similar reaction as indicated by immediate decolorization and a quantitative doubling of molecular weight. Higher molecular weight PMMA were also rapidly decolorized by diazomethane and provided a product with a bimodal molecular weight distribution. Under similar conditions, the trithiocarbonate group does not react with diazomethane."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP106720&dsid=DS4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_KsEBUd5jWUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
