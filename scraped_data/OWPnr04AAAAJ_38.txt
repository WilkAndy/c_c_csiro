Reaction then proceeds with growing polymer chains reacting alternately with the two sulfur atoms in the polymeric RAFT agent. In this system, R must be a good leaving group that is able to re-initiate polymerisation and the Z group strongly influences the stability of the intermediate disulfur macroradical species. 4, 5In order to synthesise certain novel materials, it is desirable to develop a RAFT agent that can be used at rt and with initiation techniques such as UV or gamma radiation. However, preliminary studies by the authors have shown that at low temperatures (~ 25 C), the presence of a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2785520948772471863", "cites_id": ["2785520948772471863"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2001/cc/b101794m", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NwT-aYsoqCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 17, "2003": 12, "2004": 14, "2005": 19, "2006": 14, "2007": 8, "2008": 17, "2009": 10, "2010": 14, "2011": 5, "2012": 5, "2013": 9, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 3}}
