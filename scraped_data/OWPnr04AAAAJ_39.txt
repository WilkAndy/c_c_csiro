The process regen-erates the double bond adjacent to its original position and expels a thiyl radical. It seemed to us that thistype of reaction could be uti-lized to effect chain transferin free radical polymerization, provided certain criteria were met. These include the requirement that the rate constant for addition of ma-croradicals to the allylic sulfide be comparable in mag-nitude with the propagation rate constant for the polymerization and that the fragmentation step be fast and ef-ficient to preclude copolymerization of 1 with the monomer. In addition, theexpelled thiyl radical YS\" must be effective ininitiating further polymerization. We now report preliminary experiments which demonstrate that appropriately substituted allylic sulfides can function as ideal chain-transfer agents in free radical polymerization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 189, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14568455538349693606", "cites_id": ["14568455538349693606"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00188a039", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ptpnCSCNLcoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 5, "1991": 7, "1992": 7, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 9, "1996": 9, "1997": 4, "1998": 8, "1999": 7, "2000": 8, "2001": 7, "2002": 5, "2003": 8, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 3, "2008": 7, "2009": 8, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 7, "2014": 9, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 4}}
