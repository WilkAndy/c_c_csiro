RAFT/emulsion polymerizations have considerable technical potential: to 'tailor-make' material properties, to eliminate added surfactant from surface coatings, and so on. However, considerable difficulties have been experienced in using RAFT in emulsion polymerization systems. Here, progress in the application of RAFT techniques to emulsion polymerization is reviewed, summarizing the difficulties that have been experienced and mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the observed behaviour. Possible origins of the difficulties in implementing RAFT in emulsion polymerizations include polymerization in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 160, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11193355220436196756", "cites_id": ["11193355220436196756"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ch/CH02073", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lB3dnkTJVpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 22, "2006": 17, "2007": 15, "2008": 12, "2009": 6, "2010": 10, "2011": 7, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
