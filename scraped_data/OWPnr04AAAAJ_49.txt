The course of thermolysis of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) prepared with dithiobenzoate and trithiocarbonate RAFT agents was followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), 1H NMR spectroscopy, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The weight loss profile observed depends strongly on the RAFT agent used during polymer synthesis. PMMA with a methyl trithiocarbonate end group undergoes loss of that end group at ~180\u00b0C, at least in part, by a mechanism believed to involve homolysis of the C\u2013CS2SCH3 bond and subsequent depropagation. In contrast, PMMA with a dithiobenzoate end appears more stable. Only the end group is lost at ~180\u00b0C and the dominant mechanism is proposed to be a concerted elimination process analogous to that involved in the Chugaev reaction."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 141, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=351076965376433880", "cites_id": ["351076965376433880"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/ch06229", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:2J4V0qNG3wQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 8, "2009": 11, "2010": 7, "2011": 11, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 6, "2016": 13, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 15, "2022": 15, "2023": 2}}
