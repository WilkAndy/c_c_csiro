Recently, 1\u03b1-hydroxycholecalciferol was synthesized and we report on its biological activity in rachitic chicks. 1\u03b1-Hydroxycholecalciferol is identical in potency to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption; either sterol elicits a near maximal effect at a dose of 0.3-0.6 nmol. The time-course of action of 1\u03b1-hydroxycholecalciferol also parallels that of the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol with a maximal increase in calcium transport occurring 5-10 hr after administration of sterol to vitamin D-deficient chicks. 6.5 nmol of 1\u03b1-hydroxycholecalciferol causes a doubling in calcium absorption in only 2-3 hr, which is the most rapid physiologic response yet detected for a vitamin D \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=330363831782591520", "cites_id": ["330363831782591520"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.70.8.2248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:IMwJmCewlQQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 3, "1983": 3, "1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 3, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 0, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
