End-functional polymers, prepared with ethyl a-(((carboxymethyl) thio) methyl) acrylate (2b) or a-(((carboxymethyl) thio) methyl) acrylic acid (lib), were capped with both a carboxy group and an acrylate moiety. Low molecular weight,-dicarboxypolystyrene or poly (methyl methacrylate) were readily obtained by chain transfer with lib. a-Hydroxy-< v-carboxy-and,-dihydroxy-terminated polystyrene, poly (methyl methacrylate), and poly (butyl acrylate) were prepared with a-(((2-hydroxyethyl) thio) methyl)-acrylic acid (lid) and 2-hydroxyethyla-(((2-hydroxyethyl) thio) methylacrylate (12d), respectively, while JV-phthalimidoethyl a-(((2-hydroxyethyl) thio) methyl) acrylate (13d) was used to prepare polymers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5153956380655769371", "cites_id": ["5153956380655769371"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ma00012a033", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:G1fYeAWIhkcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 5, "1994": 7, "1995": 12, "1996": 11, "1997": 5, "1998": 6, "1999": 8, "2000": 7, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
