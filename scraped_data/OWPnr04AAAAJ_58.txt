This mixture was characterized by UV\u2212vis absorption, photoluminescence excitation (PLE), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Se X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Se-XAS), electron impact mass spectrometry (EIMS), and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) to establish identifiable spectroscopic and chemical signatures that can be correlated to the chemical efficacy of the precursor for the growth of metal selenide nanocrystals. Highly temperature dependent rates of selenium dissolution and deactivation of the resultant precursor are demonstrated and optimal preparation times for the most reactive precursor are determined. Distinctive features in the PLE spectrum provide a rapid estimate of the reactivity of the as-prepared Se-ODE \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 121, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12503258206334467560", "cites_id": ["12503258206334467560"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm903813r", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6L2N8xd_hK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 12, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 11, "2015": 13, "2016": 8, "2017": 17, "2018": 6, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
