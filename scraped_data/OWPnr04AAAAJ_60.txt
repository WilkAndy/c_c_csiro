The reactive group is most commonly a vinyl group that can participate in free radical polymerization, but any polymerizable end group, such as epoxy, bis-hydroxy, etc., is sufficient for the molecule to be classified as a macromonomer. The words \u201cmacromer\u201d and \u201cmacromonomer\u201d are often used interchangeably, although the former term was introduced originally as a trademark of CPC International to describe the macromonomers discovered by Milkovich [1]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8547796429768074797", "cites_id": ["8547796429768074797"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07366579008050912", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:LaatkJDfn3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 6, "1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 9, "1996": 8, "1997": 6, "1998": 9, "1999": 7, "2000": 3, "2001": 11, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
