The proportion of each of these processes, as well as the fraction of tert-butoxy radicals that fragment to give methyl radicals, has been determined by analysis of the products that result on trapping the transient carbon-centered radicals with 1,1,3,3-tetramethylisoindoline-2-oxyl."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11891142661378768194", "cites_id": ["11891142661378768194"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222338208056464", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Qn35oD_TBaUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 3, "1992": 4, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 10, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 9, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
