The \u03b3 radiation had little or no detrimental effect on the RAFT agent, with the molecular weight of the polymer increasing linearly with conversion (up to the maximum measured conversions of 30%). The polymerization had kinetics (polym.) consistent with those of a living polymerization (first order in monomer) and proportional to the square root of the radiation\u2010dose rate. This initiation technique may facilitate the grafting of narrow polydispersity, well\u2010defined polymers onto existing polymer surfaces as well as allow a wealth of kinetic experiments using the constant radical flux generated by \u03b3 radiation. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
