These allylic compounds include bromides, phosphonates, stannanes, thioethers, sulfoxides, and sulfones. Allylic silanes and chlorides, however, do not posess significant chain transfer activity. Suitable activating substituents towards radical addition are phenyl, ethoxycarbonyl, cyano, and acetoxy. Several of the compounds have an advantage over thiols in that they do not contain sulfur."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 100, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9128787496827316281", "cites_id": ["9128787496827316281"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00395571", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:OWhrqtz3r34J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 7, "1995": 7, "1996": 4, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 8, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
