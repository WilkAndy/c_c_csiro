The RAFT process involves performing a conventional free radical polymerization in the presence of certain thiocarbonylthio compounds S= C (Z)-SR that act as highly efficient reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer agents and provide the polymerization with living characteristics. It was found that the modified RAFT procedure described provides an efficient and simple way to prepare functionalized RAFT agents. These RAFT agents can be applied to incorporate end group functionality in polymers and used as make linear and diblock light harvesting polymers that exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 92, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13898151952760287583", "cites_id": ["13898151952760287583"], "pub_url": "https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/synthesis-of-functionalized-raft-agents-for-light-harvesting-macr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:X7GtwpAn4MAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 7, "2006": 8, "2007": 5, "2008": 7, "2009": 10, "2010": 4, "2011": 8, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
