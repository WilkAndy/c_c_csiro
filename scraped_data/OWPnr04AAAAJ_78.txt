The carbon-centred radicals formed by interaction of cumyloxyl with the respective monomers were trapped as stable adducts of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-isoindolin-2-yloxyl. Extensive hydrogen atom abstraction and methyl radical generation as well as double-bond addition were observed in methyl methacrylate. Styrene underwent only double-bond addition by both cumyloxy and methyl radicals. Some possible implications of these results for polymer structure are discussed. A kinetic study of the decomposition of dicumyl hyponitrite in cyclohexane at various temperatures gave k=7.7 \u00d7 1014exp(-13600/T) s-1 for the rate constant. Rate constants for the addition of cumyloxyl to methyl methacrylate (k \u2248 2 \u00d7 104 dm3 mol-1 s-1) and styrene (k\u22482 \u00d7 105 dm3 mol-1 s-1) at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6679992236346747911", "cites_id": ["6679992236346747911"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH9822013", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:B6zQ_YsZtFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 4, "1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 4, "1992": 4, "1993": 1, "1994": 4, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 8, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 7, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
