The monomers are cyclic allylic sulfides with 6-methylene-1,4-dithiepane (3) and 3-methylene-1,5-dithiacyclooctane (4) synthesized and investigated as two examples. 6-Methylene-1,4-dithiepane (3) is a clear oil and 3-methylene-1,5-dithiacyclooctane (4) has a low, near ambient temperature melting point, and in contrast to many ring-opening monomers, they readily survive exposure to moisture and aqueous acids and bases. These compounds were polymerized in bulk with complete ring opening to give highly insoluble crystalline homopolymers of high molecular weight (Mw ca. 500\u2009000\u2212700\u2009000) with glass transition temperatures of ca. \u221230 to \u221250 \u00b0C and melting points of ca. 100\u2212130 \u00b0C. The homopolymers and their 1:1 copolymer were characterized by FT-IR and high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14967829748459429454", "cites_id": ["14967829748459429454"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma960573p", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Tt5yb9ppuM8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 6, "2002": 5, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 5}}
