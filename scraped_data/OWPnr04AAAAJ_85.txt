TMDBIO possesses a very low fluorescence quantum yield due to quenching by the nitroxide group; however, when the free-radical moiety is removed by reaction with alkyl radicals (to give an alkoxyamine), strong fluorescence is observed. Using spectrofluorimetry, the reaction of the nitroxide with polymer alkyl radicals during oxidation has been monitored. Significantly, the trapping of polymer alkyl radicals during the \u201cinduction period\u201d at 120\u00b0C is observed, when it is not possible to detect changes in the polymer using either chemiluminescence or infrared spectroscopy. This highlights the sensitivity of this method and represents the direct observation of free-radical generation in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3462551886135040830", "cites_id": ["3462551886135040830"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391005000790", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PhtwVZh0DTAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 8, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 9, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
