R. Andrews,*\u00b7! E. N. Cain, \u00a7 E. Rizzardcv and GD Smith abstract: The enzymically catalyzed conversion of chorismate to prephenate may proceed through either a chair-like or a boat-like transition state. To distinguish betweenthese alternatives, we have prepared a series of structural analogues of the two possible transition state structures and tested them as inhibitors of chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli K12. The results indicate that the en-zymically catalyzed reaction passes through a chair-like in-'The isomerization of chorismate to prephenate (Figure 1) is the first specific step in the biosynthetic pathways leading to tyrosine and phenylalanine in bacteria and other organisms (Gibson and Pittard, 1968). The reaction is an oxy-Cope re-arrangement catalyzed by either chorismate mutase-pre-phenate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3. 1.12) or chorismate mutaseprephenate dehydratase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16414925681953864854", "cites_id": ["16414925681953864854"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi00641a015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:lvxLD_CHzeMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 5, "1983": 3, "1984": 2, "1985": 3, "1986": 3, "1987": 4, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 5, "1991": 2, "1992": 4, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
