These compounds function by a radical addition\u2010fragmentation mechanism by which fragments derived from the chain transfer agents are installed at both ends of polymer chains. This provides a convenient method for preparing both mono\u2010 and di\u2010end functional oligomers and polymers. Allylic peroxides fragment to give epoxy end groups while the other allylic compounds give rise to macromonomers by introducing terminal double bonds."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=854347419659026576", "cites_id": ["854347419659026576"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/masy.19950980109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:kECMn3NA2wsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 8, "2000": 5, "2001": 8, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
