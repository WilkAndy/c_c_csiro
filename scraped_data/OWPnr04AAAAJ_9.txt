The polymerizations use addition\u2212fragmentation chain transfer agents (RAFT agents) that possess high transfer coefficients in free radical polymerization and confer living character on the polymerization. This paper explores the effect of the substituents R of dithiobenzoate RAFT agents [SC(Ph)S\u2212R] on the outcome of polymerizations of styrene, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl (BA) or methyl acrylate (MA). In MMA polymerization at 60 \u00b0C, effectiveness depends strongly on R decreasing in the order where R is:\u2009 \u2212C(Alkyl)2CN \u223c \u2212C(Me)2Ar > \u2212C(Me)2C(O)O(alkyl) > \u2212C(Me)2C(O)NH(alkyl) > \u2212C(Me)2CH2C(Me)3 \u2265 \u2212C(Me)HPh > \u2212C(Me)3 \u223c \u2212CH2Ph.
