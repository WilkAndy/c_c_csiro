Their mechanical properties and degradation resistance were compared with poly(tetramethylene oxide)\u2010based polyurethanes. The new polyurethanes were more resistant to hydrolysis and to hydrogen peroxide\u2010induced oxidation than were the poly(tetramethylene oxide) \u2010based materials. The poly(octamethylene oxide) \u2010based polyurethane displayed good resistance to sodium hypochlorite. 1,2\u2010Diaminoethane chain\u2010extended polyurethane\u2013ureas were also prepared using the macrodiols poly(hexamethylene oxide) and poly(octamethylene oxide). They were not thermally processable or solvent\u2010castable.
