IR spectral changes were similar to those observed after degradation in vivo. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that hydrogen\u2010peroxideinduced degradation was associated with greater order in the hard domain and greater mobility in the soft domain. Studies conducted with low\u2010molecular\u2010weight model compounds for the hard and soft segments confirmed that methylene groups adjacent to oxygen were susceptible toward oxidation. The extent of degradation of a series of commercial polyurethanes on treatment with hydrogen peroxide (25%, 24 h, 100\u00b0C) correlated well with their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18411753407424004156", "cites_id": ["18411753407424004156"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbm.820270308", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:PICYpSywg_8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 10, "1996": 5, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 7, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
