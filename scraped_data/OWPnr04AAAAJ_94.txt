Results from the nitroxide trapping clearly show that the initiation step ranges from simple clean addition to the head of the monomer, to complex addition/abstraction reactions. Careful selection of the monomer/initiation system is emphasized with particular reference to two common monomers, styrene and methyl methacrylate, and two initiating radicals, t-butoxy and benzoyloxy. The discovery of nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP) from observations made during the nitroxide trapping work is reported and the ability to have a living radical system demonstrated with numerous examples. Similarly, the study of the copolymerization of macromonomers, formed by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "OWPnr04AAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10353467201835126527", "cites_id": ["10353467201835126527"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/CH12194", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_04Kp5Dnro8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 9, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
