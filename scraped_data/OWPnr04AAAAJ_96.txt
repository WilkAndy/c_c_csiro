This differs from classical endogenous control of synthesis by classical anionoid and cationoid groups in the skeleton, and its application has many theoretical and practical advantages. It is illustrated by considerations of reactions of substituted tricarbonylcyclohexa-l,3-dieneiron derivatives; notably the derived dienyliron salts, which are defined as equivalents of specifically substituted aryl cations or as cyclohex-2-enone cations, dependent on the structures and reaction sequences. The effects are noted of classical substituents on the positions and on the rates of reactivity of some complexed dienyl cations ; both regio- and stereospecificities are dependent on the nature of the anion involved and the conditions. Probable mechanisms are discussed.
