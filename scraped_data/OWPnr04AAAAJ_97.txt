This provides direct measurement of radical loss processes. A water-insoluble RAFT agent, 2-phenylprop-2-yl phenyldithioacetate, was transported to preformed seed particles using acetone, the acetone then removed, the particles swollen with monomer, and RAFT-mediated polymerization initiated by \u03b3-irradiation. The systems show good control over the molecular weight of the products and a retardation dependent on the concentration of RAFT agent. Kinetic parameters are obtained from the \u03b3-relaxation experiments, using pseudo-bulk kinetics as an approximation to full compartmentalization/chain-length-dependent kinetics to describe the systems.
