Weekly fluxes are estimated on a 3.75\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 (longitude\u2010latitude) grid throughout the 21 years. The assimilated observations include 128 station records from three large data sets of surface CO2 mixing ratio measurements. A Monte Carlo approach rigorously quantifies the theoretical uncertainty of the inverted fluxes at various space and time scales, which is particularly important for proper interpretation of the inverted fluxes. Fluxes are evaluated indirectly against two independent CO2 vertical profile data sets constructed from aircraft measurements in the boundary layer and in the free troposphere. The skill of the inversion is evaluated by the improvement brought over a simple benchmark flux estimation based on the observed atmospheric growth rate. Our error analysis indicates that the carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 285, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5731213815063939532", "cites_id": ["5731213815063939532"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010JD013887", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zImyeplciU8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 13, "2012": 13, "2013": 24, "2014": 14, "2015": 19, "2016": 24, "2017": 25, "2018": 32, "2019": 31, "2020": 28, "2021": 21, "2022": 22, "2023": 12}}
