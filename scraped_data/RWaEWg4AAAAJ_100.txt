Observations were confined between the latitudes of 40\u00b0S and 55\u00b0S and between the longitudes of 135\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E, which covers a region south of the island of Tasmania. Because of the remoteness of the region that was sampled, the microphysical cloud structure represents background conditions in which anthropogenic influences are minimal. Maximum cloud droplet concentrations for individual case studies ranged between 45 and 200 cm\u22123. These numbers are consistent with those reported from the summer phase of the Southern Ocean Cloud Experiment (SOCEX II, February 1995) and confirm that the droplet concentrations in an unpolluted atmosphere are largely constrained to values below 200 cm\u22123 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17476186714129334528", "cites_id": ["17476186714129334528"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97JD03280", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AIEURDnjh_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
