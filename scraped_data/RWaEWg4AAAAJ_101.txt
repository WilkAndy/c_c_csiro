Measurements made included non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) (PTR-MS), particle number size distribution, condensation nuclei (CN) > 3 nm, black carbon (BC) concentration, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number, ozone (O3), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), halocarbons and meteorology.  During the first plume strike event (BB1), a 4 h enhancement of CO (max ~ 2100 ppb), BC (~ 1400 ng m-3) and particles > 3 nm (~ 13 000 cm-3) with dominant particle mode of 120 nm were observed overnight. A wind direction change lead to a dramatic reduction in BB tracers and a drop in the dominant particle mode to 50 nm. The dominant mode increased in size to 80 nm over 5 h in calm sunny conditions, accompanied by an increase in ozone. Due to an enhancement in BC but not CO during particle growth, the presence of BB emissions during this period could not be confirmed.  The ability of particles > 80 nm (CN80) to act as CCN at 0.5 % supersaturation was investigated. The \u0394CCN / \u0394CN80 ratio was lowest during the fresh BB plume (56 \u00b1 8 %), higher during the particle growth period (77 \u00b1 4 %) and higher still (104 \u00b1 3 %) in background marine air. Particle size distributions indicate that changes to particle chemical composition, rather than particle size, are driving these changes. Hourly average CCN during both BB events were between 2000 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8553803451374317392", "cites_id": ["8553803451374317392"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/15/13393/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UC-tRes2tXYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
