As the atmospheric mixing ratios of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) (MCF), the commonly used OH reference gas, approaches zero, it is important to find alternative approaches to infer atmospheric OH abundance and variability. The lack of global bottom\u2010up emission inventories is the primary obstacle in choosing a MCF alternative. We illustrate that global emissions of long\u2010lived trace gases can be inferred from their observed mixing ratio differences between the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), given realistic estimates of their NH\u2010SH exchange time, the emission partitioning between the two hemispheres, and the NH versus SH OH abundance ratio. Using the observed long\u2010term trend and emissions derived from the measured hemispheric \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7046133723887810340", "cites_id": ["7046133723887810340"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017JD026926", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JLc7NErlyGEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 2}}
