Global emissions of these perfluorocarbons (PFCs) calculated from atmospheric measurements are significantly greater than expected from reported national and industry\u2010based emission inventories. In this study, in situ measurements of the two PFCs in the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment network are used to show that their emission ratio varies according to the relative regional presence of these two industries, providing an industry\u2010specific emission \u201csignature\u201d to apportion the observed emissions. Our results suggest that underestimated emissions from the global semiconductor industry during 1990\u20132010, as well as from China's aluminum industry after 2002, account for the observed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6327943789709951632", "cites_id": ["6327943789709951632"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014GL059783", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kAJNkFlf0VcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 10, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
