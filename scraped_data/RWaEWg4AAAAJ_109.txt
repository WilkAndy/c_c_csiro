This slowing is widespread but determined with greatest certainty in the largest well-mixed portion of the global troposphere (30\u25e6S\u201390\u25e6S). We rely on atmospheric mixing for global integration and selection of atmospheric data for spatial representativeness. Prior to 2002/2003, after empirical adjustment for perturbations associated with ENSO and volcanic activity (EV), dCa/dt increases are well represented by linear regression, using direct monitoring records from 1990 or 1965, also from preindustrial times using archived air. In contrast,modelled atmospheric trends due to reported emissions dCE/dt (assuming historically consistent oceanic and terrestrial uptake mechanisms), agree with dCa/dt or dCa/dt-EV up until \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:kzcrU_BdoSEC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8247192283392722190", "cites_id": ["8247192283392722190"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2010.00472.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DkX3ra_pc3IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
