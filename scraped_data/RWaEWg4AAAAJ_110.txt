The inversions employ the GEOS-Chem adjoint and an array of aggregation strategies 20 to test how well current observations can constrain the spatial distribution of global N2O emissions. The strategies include:(1) a standard 4D-Var inversion at native model resolution (4\u00d7 5),(2) an inversion for six continental and three ocean regions, and (3) a fast 4D-Var inversion based on a novel dimension reduction technique employing randomized singular value decomposition (SVD). The optimized global flux ranges from 15.9 Tg N yr-1 (SVD-based inversion) to 17.5-17.7 Tg N yr-1 (continental-scale, standard 4D-Var inversions), with the former better capturing the N2O background measured during 25 the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) airborne campaigns. We find that the tropics provide a greater contribution to the global N2O flux than is predicted by the prior bottom-up inventories, likely due to underestimated agricultural and oceanic emissions. We infer an overestimate of natural soil emissions in the extratropics, and find that predicted emissions are seasonally biased in northern midlatitudes. Here, optimized fluxes exhibit a springtime versus summertime peak more consistent with the timing of fertilizer application, soil thawing, and elevated soil moisture. Finally, the inversions reveal a 30 major emission underestimate in the US Corn Belt (which may extend to other intensive agricultural regions), likely from underrepresentation of indirect N2O emissions from leaching and runoff.
