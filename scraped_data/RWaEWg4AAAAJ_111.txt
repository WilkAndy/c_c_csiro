Understanding the role of clouds in assessing the impact of climate change is a challenging issue. It is thought that plankton and seaweed contribute to the formation of clouds by emitting gases that lead to the particle production necessary for cloud formation. Macroalgae (kelp) at Mace Head, Ireland, produce large quantities of iodine when exposed to sunlight at low tide and this iodine results in the rapid production of particles. Cape Grim, Tasmania, also has large colonies of kelp and the role of Bull Kelp (Durvillaea potatorum) in particle production was assessed. Abstract. Iodine emissions from coastal macroalgae have been found to be important initiators for nucleation events at Mace Head, Ireland. The source of this iodine is the large beds of the brown kelp Laminaria digitata, which are significantly exposed at low tide. On the coast around Cape Grim, Tasmania, there are beds of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14170668468577794230", "cites_id": ["14170668468577794230"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN07041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tnhoi-RTqMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
