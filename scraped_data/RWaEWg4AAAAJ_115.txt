As such, its emissions of greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases are of global significance. However, unlike neighbouring China, the Indian sub-continent is very poorly monitored by atmospheric measurement networks. India's halocarbon emissions, here defined as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and chlorocarbons, are not well-known. Previous measurements from the region have been obtained at observatories many hundreds of kilometres from source regions, or at high altitudes, limiting their value for the estimation of regional emission rates. Given the projected rapid growth in demand for refrigerants and solvents in India, emission estimates of these halocarbons are urgently needed to provide a benchmark against which future changes can be evaluated. In this study, we report atmospheric-measurement-derived halocarbon emissions from India. With the exception of dichloromethane, these top-down estimates are the first for India's halocarbons. Air samples were collected at low altitude during an aircraft campaign in June and July 2016, and emissions were derived from measurements of these samples using an inverse modelling framework. These results were evaluated to assess India's progress in phasing out ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol. India's combined CFC emissions are estimated to be 54\u202f(27\u201386)\u202fTg\u202f\u202fyr (5th and 95th confidence intervals are shown in parentheses). HCFC-22 emissions of 7.8\u202f(6.0\u20139.9)\u202fGg\u202fyr are of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8518538021464752410", "cites_id": ["8518538021464752410"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/19/9865/2019/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GsEQhzLtN3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 10, "2022": 9}}
