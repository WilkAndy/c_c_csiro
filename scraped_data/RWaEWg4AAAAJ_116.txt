This mechanism is globally important: while other contributions to the global budget of O2 impart isotopic signatures, the O(3P)\u2009+\u2009O2 reaction resets all such signatures in the atmosphere on subdecadal timescales. Consequently, the isotopic distribution within O2 is determined by O3 photochemistry and the circulation patterns that control where that photochemistry occurs. The variability of isotopic ordering in O2 has not been established, however. We present new measurements of 18O18O in air (reported as \u039436 values) from the surface to 33\u2009km altitude. They confirm the basic features of the clumped\u2010isotope budget of O2: Stratospheric air has higher \u039436 values than tropospheric air (i.e., more 18O18O), reflecting colder temperatures and fast photochemical cycling of O3.
