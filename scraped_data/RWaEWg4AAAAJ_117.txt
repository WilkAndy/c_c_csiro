The recent adjustment of the calibration scale for H2 translates into a change in the tropospheric burden. Furthermore, the ECMWF Reanalysis\u2010Interim (ERA\u2010Interim) data from the European Centre for Medium\u2010Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) used in this study show slower vertical transport than the operational data used before. Consequently, more H2 is removed by deposition. The deposition parametrization is updated because significant deposition fluxes for snow, water, and vegetation surfaces were calculated in our previous study. Timescales of 1\u20132\u2009h are asserted for the transport of H2 through the canopies of densely vegetated regions. The global scale variability of H2 and \u03b4[DH2] is well represented by the updated model. H2 is slightly overestimated in the Southern Hemisphere because too little H2 is removed by dry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:SpbeaW3--B0C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11211784834128097184", "cites_id": ["11211784834128097184"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgrd.50204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oC9RcOdCmJsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3}}
