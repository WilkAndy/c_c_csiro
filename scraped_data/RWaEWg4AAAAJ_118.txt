Severe loss of stratospheric ozone associated with the so-called ozone hole continues to occur each spring over Antarctica as it has done annually since around 1980 (Farman et al. 1985; Stolarski et al. 1986; Hassler et al. 2011). Meteorological factors continue to play a significant role in the interannual variability of the size and severity of the Antarctic ozone hole (WMO 2011a). However as shown by Salby et al.(2011), when account is made for variability driven by the propagation of planetary waves into the polar stratosphere, indications of ozone recovery are emerging. In the Arctic, less severe but overall significant ozone loss has been observed in boreal spring since the"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12764037939865564939", "cites_id": ["12764037939865564939"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Alexander-4/publication/262415742_The_Antarctic_ozone_hole_during_2010/links/58b363ce92851cf7ae91d658/The-Antarctic-ozone-hole-during-2010.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C7dLKeH4IrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 6, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
