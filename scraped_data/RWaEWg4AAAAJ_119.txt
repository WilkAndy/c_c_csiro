BASELINE CARBON DIOXIDE MONITORING", "pub_year": 2004, "citation": "Baseline, 36, 2004", "author": "LP Steele and PB Krummel and DA Spencer and LW Porter and SB Baly and RL Langenfelds and LN Cooper and MV Van der Schoot and GA Da Costa", "journal": "Baseline", "pages": "36", "abstract": "Over the two years 2001-2002, the continuous measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in air drawn from the 70-m intake continued with the Siemens ULTRAMAT 5E (serial number X08-397) infrared gas analyser system known as BASGAM. Shown in Figure 1 are the hourly CO2 values for this period with corresponding baseline data. The top panel shows all instrumentally valid hourly values, with baseline data shown in red and non-baseline data shown in blue, illustrating the large number of departures of CO2 both above and below the baseline values. As noted previously, the largest negative departures from baseline levels occur predominantly in the winter months of each year, while the largest positive excursions occur in the summer months. In the second panel are shown hourly baseline data only (see Steele et al. 2003 for details of the baseline selection technique). Also shown in this panel is the 80-day smooth curve (blue) and 650-day trend curve found using the filtering techniques of Thoning et al.[1989]. A change in the way these CO2 data are reported here is the use of units of \u00b5mol mol-1 instead of parts per million, as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), and described by Schwartz and Warneck [1995]. The change to the BASGAM CO2 monitoring program introduced from the beginning of 1997 (the use of high-span, low-span, and reference gases prepared in CSIRO GASLAB from dry natural air) continued through 2001-2002. The salient details of the high-span, low-span, and reference gases used for BASGAM monitoring during 2001-2002 are given in Table 1.
