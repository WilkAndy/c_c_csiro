Each model was run with prescribed fluxes and forced with analysed meteorology for 2000\u20132003. Twelve models were chosen for analysis based on each model\u2019s ability to differentiate baseline CO2 concentrations from non-baseline CO2 (influenced by regional land fluxes). Analysis focused on non-baseline events during 2002\u20132003. Radon was better simulated than CO2, indicating that a spatially uniform radon land flux is a reasonable assumption and that regional-scale transport was adequately captured by the models. For both radon and CO2, the ensemble model mean generally performed better than any individual model. Two case studies highlight common problems with the simulations.
