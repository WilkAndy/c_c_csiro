This unique balance of sources poses significant challenges for global models. Carbon monoxide (CO) in particular is difficult to simulate in the SH due to the increased importance of secondary chemical production associated with the much more limited primary emissions. Here, we use aircraft observations from the 1991\u20132000 Cape Grim Overflight Program (CGOP) and the 2009\u20132011 HIAPER (High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO), together with model output from the SH Model Intercomparison Project, to elucidate the drivers of CO vertical structure in the remote SH. Observed CO vertical profiles from Cape Grim are remarkably consistent with those observed over the southern mid-latitudes Pacific 10\u201320 years later, despite major differences in time periods, flight locations, and sampling strategies between the two data sets. These similarities suggest the processes driving observed vertical gradients are coherent across much of the remote SH and have not changed significantly over the past 2 decades. Model ability to simulate CO profiles reflects the interplay between biogenic emission sources, the chemical mechanisms that drive CO production from these sources, and the transport that redistributes this CO throughout the SH. The four chemistry-climate and chemical transport models included in the intercomparison show large \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=242949372896814441", "cites_id": ["242949372896814441"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/15/3217/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aSXr3SohXwMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
