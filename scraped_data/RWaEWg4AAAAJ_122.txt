We found that interannual variability in N2O is weakly correlated with that in CFC\u201012 and SF6 for the northern extratropics and more strongly correlated for the southern extratropics, suggesting that interannual variability in all these species is influenced by large\u2010scale atmospheric circulation changes and, for SF6 in particular, interhemispheric transport. N2O interannual variability was not, however, correlated with polar lower stratospheric temperature, which is used as a proxy for stratosphere\u2010to\u2010troposphere transport in the extratropics. This suggests that stratosphere\u2010to\u2010troposphere transport is not a dominant factor in year\u2010to\u2010year variations in N2O growth rate. Instead, we found strong correlations of N2O interannual variability with the Multivariate ENSO Index.
