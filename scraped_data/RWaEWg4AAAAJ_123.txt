Figure\u00e13 of our Article demonstrated this inconsistency between the two largest and most precisely determined terms in the global carbon budget. If the curves represent global trends, then the changing difference represents variation in sinks to maintain global mass balance. We estimated a magnitude for the difference between the curves at~ 9\u00e1Pg\u00e1C between 1994 and 2005, obtained by overlapping the curves during a recent four-year period of unusually quiet natural interannual variability (IAV). We make no previous assumptions about sink changes on timeframes of longer than three to five years (that is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:_OXeSy2IsFwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15192507125463433080", "cites_id": ["15192507125463433080"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1925", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eL_WvLyg1tIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
