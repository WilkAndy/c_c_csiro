In both years, ozone holes formed that were fairly typical of those observed since the late 1990s. The ozone hole of 2008 was somewhat larger than that of 2009. In 2009 the ozone hole developed more rapidly, but did not last as long as in 2008, particularly in the lower stratosphere."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13306122663745229412", "cites_id": ["13306122663745229412"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simon-Alexander-4/publication/313947144_The_Antarctic_ozone_hole_during_2008_and_2009/links/58b363da92851cf7ae91d65a/The-Antarctic-ozone-hole-during-2008-and-2009.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZBJPVhDYqLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
