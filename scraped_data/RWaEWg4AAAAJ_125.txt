The ozone hole has formed every spring since the early 1980s. Its depth and size increased up until the late 1990s, and since then conditions have generally stabilised. However there has been considerable interannual variability in the severity of the ozone hole, particularly during the past decade, with unusually benign conditions in 2002 and 2004 associated with warm stratospheric temperatures.Apart from the direct consequence of ozone depletion in reducing the shielding of the surface from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and its consequent impacts on human health and ecosystems, in more recent years the importance of ozone for climate has been increasingly recognised. It is now realised that ozone depletion and recovery have substantial effects on modelled climate predictions and need to be accurately represented in climate models (Cordero and Forster 2006). In particular, the impact on climate of the formation and eventual recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole is now being closely studied (Cai 2006; Keeley et al. 2007; Roscoe and Haigh 2007; Crook et al. 2008; Perlwitz et al. 2008; Son et al. 2008)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13839599281278412374", "cites_id": ["13839599281278412374"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/41694273/tully.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VuZZkjgiEMAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
