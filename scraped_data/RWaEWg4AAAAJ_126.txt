The global mean tropospheric abundance was 0.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009ppt (parts per trillion, dry air mole fraction) in 2012, rising from 0.04\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009ppt in 2000. We combine the measurements with a model and an inverse method to estimate rising global emissions\u2014from 0.43\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2000 to 1.13\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2012 (~1.9\u2009Tg\u2009CO2\u2010eq\u2009yr\u22121 based on a 100\u2009year global warming potential of 1660).
