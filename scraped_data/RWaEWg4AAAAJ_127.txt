The long-term growth rate of SF6 as observed at Cape Grim has increased from 0.1 ppt yr-1 in the late 1970s to 0.24 ppt yr-1 in the mid-1990s. Since then the growth rate has remained relatively constant at 0.23\u00b10.02 ppt yr-1, indicating relatively constant global emissions (\u00b110%) since 1995. Pollution episodes at Cape Grim have been used to estimate regional (Melbourne and environs) and Australian emissions of SF6 at 3\u00b11.5 and 15\u00b17.5 tonnes yr-1 during 2001-2003."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13318181342878829957", "cites_id": ["13318181342878829957"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/baseline_2001-2002.pdf#page=25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hQ2HXF6v07gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
