Estimations of tropospheric OH trends and variability based on budget analysis of methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) and process\u2010based chemistry transport models often produce conflicting results. Here we use a previously tested transport model to simulate atmospheric CH3CCl3 for the period 1985\u20132018. Based on mismatches between model output and observations, we derive consistent anomalies in the inverse lifetime of CH3CCl3 (KG) using measurements from two independent observational networks (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment). Our method allows a separation between \u201cphysical\u201d (transport, temperature) and \u201cchemical\u201d (i.e., abundance) influences on OH + CH3CCl3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11364296391202752943", "cites_id": ["11364296391202752943"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JD033862", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r8nkb1sXtp0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
