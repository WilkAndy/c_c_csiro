Gas Bull", "volume": "8", "pages": "11012", "abstract": "The latest analysis of observations from the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme shows that the globally averaged mixing ratios of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2 O) reached new highs in 2010, with CO2 at 389.0 ppm, CH4 at 1808 ppb and N2 O at 323.2 ppb. These values are greater than those in pre-industrial times (before 1750) by 39%, 158% and 20%, respectively. Atmospheric increases of CO2 and N2 O from 2009 to 2010 are consistent with recent years, but they are higher than both those observed from 2008 to 2009 and those averaged over the past 10 years. Atmospheric CH4 continues to increase, consistent with the past three years. The NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index shows that from 1990 to 2010, radiative forcing by longlived greenhouse gases increased by 29%, with CO2 accounting for nearly 80% of this increase. Radiative forcing of N2 O exceeded that of CFC-12, making N2 O the third most important long-lived greenhouse gas.Nitrous oxide is now the third most important contributor to radiative forcing of long-lived greenhouse gases, recently surpassing CFC-12, and its impact on climate integrated over 100 years is 298 times greater than equal emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). It plays an important role in stratospheric ozone (O3) destruction. The major anthropogenic source of N2 O to the atmosphere is the use of nitrogen containing fertilizers (including manure), which have profoundly affected the global nitrogen cycle. Reductions in the amounts of fertilizer applied to agricultural fields to better match the nitrogen needs of crops can reduce N2 O emissions. Such changes must be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:uDGL6kOW6j0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16460066703099217620", "cites_id": ["16460066703099217620"], "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/197586458.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1MZ2EXXnbeQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
