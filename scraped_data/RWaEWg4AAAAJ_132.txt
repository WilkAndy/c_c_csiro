Atmospheric particles play an important role in the global climate system; they contribute to the radiation balance directly, but they also have an indirect effect by modifying cloud properties and influencing precipitation. Over the Southern Ocean, nanometre-sized particle production is believed to be largely natural, although the processes that lead to these particles are not well understood. This work provides new observations of atmospheric nanoparticles, and shows that they arise from diverse sources of production. Abstract. This paper presents analyses of a two-year record of aerosol measurements made at the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS) in Tasmania covering the period 1999 and 2000. The focus of the study is nanoparticles, defined here as particles with diameter Dp, in the range 3 \u2264 Dp \u2264 12 nm; with the number concentration determined using two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9629496968232312966", "cites_id": ["9629496968232312966"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en07038", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hiAwLXnYooUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
