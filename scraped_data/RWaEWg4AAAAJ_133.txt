In addition to the major HFCs, HCFCs and CFCs, the new observations include the first in situ time series of the C1\u2013C3 PFCs (CF4, C2F6 and C3F8) and the more volatile of the HFCs (CHF3, CH2F2, CH3CF3) alongside SF6, all of which are now monitored routinely as part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE). Observed trends in newly monitored species are shown, obtained from 1\u20132 years continuous in situ air analyses at remote monitoring sites at Mace Head (Ireland) and Cape Grim (Australia). Observed deviations in the air background for these gas species are linked to modelled trajectories of air masses arriving at the monitoring stations to indicate potential source regions for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13643398024882398047", "cites_id": ["13643398024882398047"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15693430500402614", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X6NhwjcWV70J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
