The objective of the flight was the investigation of the impact of clouds on the formation and destruction of aerosol in the boundary layer. The principle focus of this paper is an examination of the thermodynamic structure and a quantification of the entrainment rate. Three methods are presented. The first method uses the thermodynamic budget of the boundary layer to calculate its evolution over time. The second uses turbulence flux observations near the inversion, while the third uses estimates of the subsidence rate together with direct observations of the rate of change of cloud top height. All three methods suffer from serious errors. Our best estimate for the entrainment rate is 4 mm s\u22121 with an \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12278735367021574528", "cites_id": ["12278735367021574528"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00529", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gLlYwsLUZqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
