Recent studies highlight the increasing influence of such compounds, particularly CH2Cl2, on the stratospheric chlorine budget and therefore on ozone depletion. Here, a multiyear global\u2010scale synthesis inversion was performed to optimize CH2Cl2 (2006\u20132017) and C2Cl4 (2007\u20132017) emissions. The approach combines long\u2010term surface observations from global monitoring networks, output from a three\u2010dimensional chemical transport model (TOMCAT), and novel bottom\u2010up information on prior industry emissions. Our posterior results show an increase in global CH2Cl2 emissions from 637 \u00b1 36 Gg yr\u22121 in 2006 to 1,171 \u00b1 45 Gg yr\u22121 in 2017, with Asian emissions accounting for 68% and 89% of these totals, respectively.
