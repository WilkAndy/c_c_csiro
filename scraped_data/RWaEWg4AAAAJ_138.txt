A recent study showed rapidly increasing atmospheric abundances and emissions. We report that, following this rise, the atmospheric abundance and emissions have declined sharply in the past three years. We find a Northern Hemisphere HCFC\u2010133a increase from 0.13 ppt (dry\u2010air mole fraction in parts per trillion) in 2000 to 0.50 ppt in 2012\u2013mid\u20102013 followed by an abrupt drop to \u223c0.44 ppt by early 2015. Global emissions derived from these observations peaked at 3.1 kt in 2011, followed by a rapid decline of \u223c0.5 kt yr\u22122 to reach 1.5 kt yr\u22121 in 2014. Sporadic HCFC\u2010133a pollution events are detected in Europe from our high\u2010resolution HCFC\u2010133a records at three European stations, and in Asia from samples collected in Taiwan.
