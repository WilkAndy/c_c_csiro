The employed measurement ensemble includes approximately weekly and quasi-continuous N2O measurements (hourly averages used) from several long-term monitoring networks, N2O measurements collected from discrete air samples onboard a commercial aircraft (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container; CARIBIC), and quasi-continuous measurements from the airborne HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaigns. For a 2-year inversion, we find that the surface and HIPPO observations can accurately resolve a uniform bias in emissions during the first year; CARIBIC data provide a somewhat weaker constraint. Variable emission errors are much more difficult to resolve given the long lifetime of N2O, and major parts of the world lack significant constraints on the seasonal cycle of fluxes. Current observations can largely correct a global bias in the stratospheric sink of N2O if emissions are known, but do not provide information on the temporal and spatial distribution of the sink. However, for the more realistic scenario where source and sink are both uncertain, we find that simultaneously optimizing both would require unrealistically small errors in model transport. Regardless, a bias in the magnitude of the N2O sink would not affect the a posteriori N2O emissions for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10218568059589123029", "cites_id": ["10218568059589123029"], "pub_url": "https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/8/3179/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1Vv2iIKlz40J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
