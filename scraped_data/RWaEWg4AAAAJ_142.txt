The reconstruction shows that H2 levels in the southern hemisphere were roughly constant near 330 parts per billion (ppb; nmol H2 mol\u22121 air) during the mid to late 1800s. Over the twentieth century, H2 levels rose by about 70% to 550 ppb. The reconstruction shows good agreement with the H2 atmospheric history based on firn air measurements from the South Pole. The broad trends in atmospheric H2 over the twentieth century can be explained by increased methane oxidation and anthropogenic emissions. The H2 rise shows no evidence of deceleration during the last quarter of the twentieth century despite an expected reduction in automotive emissions following more stringent regulations. During the late twentieth century, atmospheric CO levels \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4555389877080703040", "cites_id": ["4555389877080703040"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2103335118", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QEDOLPX-Nz8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
