In this study, we discuss characteristics of the 2018 and 2019 Antarctic ozone holes using surface in\u2009situ, satellite and reanalysis data to gain a better understanding of recent ozone variability. These ozone holes had strongly contrasting characteristics. In 2018, the Antarctic stratospheric vortex was relatively stable and cold in comparison to most years of the prior decade. This resulted in a large and persistent ozone hole that ranked in the upper-tercile of metrics quantifying Antarctic ozone depletion. In contrast, strong stratospheric warming in the spring of 2019 curtailed the development of the ozone hole, causing it to be anomalously small and of similar size to ozone holes in the 1980s.
