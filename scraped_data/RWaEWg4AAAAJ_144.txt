Despite this importance, there are very few published measurements of ambient VOC concentrations in Australia. In this paper, we present mole fractions of several important VOCs measured during the campaign known as MUMBA (Measurements of Urban, Marine and Biogenic Air) in the Australian city of Wollongong (34\u00b0S). We particularly focus on measurements made during periods when clean marine air impacted the measurement site and on VOCs of biogenic origin. Typical unpolluted marine air mole fractions during austral summer 2012-2013 at latitude 34\u00b0S were established for CO2 (391.0 \u00b1 0.6 ppm), CH4 (1760.1 \u00b1 0.4 ppb), N2O (325.04 \u00b1 0.08 ppb), CO (52.4 \u00b1 1.7 ppb), O3 (20.5 \u00b1 1.1 ppb), acetaldehyde (190 \u00b1 40 ppt), acetone (260 \u00b1 30 ppt), dimethyl sulphide (50 \u00b1 10 ppt), benzene (20 \u00b1 10 ppt), toluene (30 \u00b1 20 ppt), C8H10 aromatics (23 \u00b1 6 ppt) and C9H12 aromatics (36 \u00b1 7 ppt). The MUMBA site was frequently influenced by VOCs of biogenic origin from a nearby strip of forested parkland to the east due to the dominant north-easterly afternoon sea breeze. VOCs from the more distant densely forested escarpment to the west also impacted the site, especially during two days of extreme heat and strong westerly winds. The relative amounts of different biogenic VOCs observed for these two biomes differed, with much larger increases of isoprene than of monoterpenes or methanol during the hot westerly winds from the escarpment than with cooler winds from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5924855786455862734", "cites_id": ["5924855786455862734"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/494432", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zo0eUfJQOVIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
