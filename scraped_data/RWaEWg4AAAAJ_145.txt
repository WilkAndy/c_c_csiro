Although HCFC\u201031 has never been produced in large amounts, observed mole fractions in the Northern Hemisphere increased from 2000 onward, reaching 170 ppq (parts per quadrillion, 10\u221215) in 2011\u20132012 before decreasing rapidly. By combining our observations with a two\u2010dimensional atmospheric chemistry\u2010transport model, we infer an increase in global emissions from 240\u2009t\u2009yr\u22121 in 2000 to 840\u2009t\u2009yr\u22121 in 2011\u20132012, followed by a relatively fast decline to 570\u2009t\u2009yr\u22121 in 2014. Emissions of HCFC\u201031 originate most probably from intermediate product release during the manufacturing process of HFC\u201032 (CH2F2). The rapid decline in recent years could be due to changes in production methods rather than declines in diffusive sources such as landfills or HCFC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9454400480654921866", "cites_id": ["9454400480654921866"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015gl064709", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ihC4RSXHNIMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
