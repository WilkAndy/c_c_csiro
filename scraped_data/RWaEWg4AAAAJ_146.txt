The University of Wollongong FTIR trace gas analyser for determination of atmospheric trace gas concentrations has been significantly refined in the past decade since its initial development, providing improved accuracy and greater ease of operation. From October 2008 to February 2009 we operated a new analyser at Cape Grim, parallel to the CSIRO LoFlo CO2 analyser and AGAGE automated GC system. The FTIR analyser drew air from the 70-m tower inlet and operated continuously and autonomously for 110 days measuring 10-minute average concentrations of CO2,\uf064 13C-CO2, CH4, CO and N2O. Here the measurements are compared with LoFlo for CO2, AGAGE for the other gases and isotope ratio mass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=591515079574703132", "cites_id": ["591515079574703132"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP105039&sb=RECENT&n=2&rpp=25&page=45&tr=5045&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HExWtdR7NQgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
