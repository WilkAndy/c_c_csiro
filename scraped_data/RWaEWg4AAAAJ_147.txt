Clouds and the factors controlling cloud properties are essential components in understanding and accurately predicting global climate change. This work examines nanometre-sized atmospheric particles, particularly bursts of enhanced particle concentrations following cold fronts over the Southern Ocean. The properties of these events have been established to enable modelling of their significance as a source of cloud-droplet-forming nuclei. Abstract. Nanoparticles (diameter <10 nm) were studied in clean maritime air at Cape Grim over a 2-year period. Concentrations were determined using a condensation nucleus counter (CNC) and an ultra-CNC (UCNC), requiring careful treatment of drifts in counter efficiency. This is the first extended examination of nanoparticles following cold fronts and shows that nanoparticle enhancements were present following 94% of 121 cold fronts studied \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5426490813918218432", "cites_id": ["5426490813918218432"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en09075", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wAiE_KTETksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
