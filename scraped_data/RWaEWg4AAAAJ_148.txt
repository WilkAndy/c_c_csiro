However, growing emissions of unregulated short-lived anthropogenic chlorocarbons are offsetting some of these gains. Here, we report an increase in emissions from China of the industrially produced chlorocarbon, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The emissions grew from 231 (213\u2013245) Gg yr\u22121 in 2011 to 628 (599\u2013658) Gg yr\u22121 in 2019, with an average annual increase of 13 (12\u201315) %, primarily from eastern China. The overall increase in CH2Cl2 emissions from China has the same magnitude as the global emission rise of 354 (281\u2212427) Gg yr\u22121 over the same period. If global CH2Cl2 emissions remain at 2019 levels, they could lead to a delay in Antarctic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6066487965560450973", "cites_id": ["6066487965560450973"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27592-y", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:na9pval-MFQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 3, "2023": 8}}
