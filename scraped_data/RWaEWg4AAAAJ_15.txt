We derive optimized fluxes from June 2009 to December 2010. We estimate fluxes from surface CO2 measurements to use as baselines for comparing GOSAT data-derived fluxes. Assimilating only GOSAT data, we can reproduce the observed CO2 time series at surface and TCCON sites in the tropics and the northern extra-tropics. In contrast, in the southern extra-tropics GOSAT XCO2 leads to enhanced seasonal cycle amplitudes compared to independent measurements, and we identify it as the result of a land\u2013sea bias in our GOSAT XCO2 retrievals. A bias correction in the form of a global offset between GOSAT land and sea pixels in a joint inversion of satellite and surface measurements of CO2 yields plausible global flux estimates which are more tightly constrained than in an inversion using surface CO2 data alone. We show that assimilating the bias-corrected GOSAT data on top of surface CO2 data (a) reduces the estimated global land sink of CO2, and (b) shifts the terrestrial net uptake of carbon from the tropics to the extra-tropics. It is concluded that while GOSAT total column CO2 provide useful constraints for source\u2013sink inversions, small spatiotemporal biases \u2013 beyond what can be detected using current validation techniques \u2013 have serious consequences for optimized fluxes, even aggregated over continental scales."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 236, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4772881531533563035", "cites_id": ["4772881531533563035"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/8695/2013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m5QUEneuPEIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 6, "2014": 23, "2015": 23, "2016": 19, "2017": 20, "2018": 26, "2019": 26, "2020": 19, "2021": 29, "2022": 32, "2023": 12}}
