With atmospheric lifetimes on the order of thousands to tens of thousands of years, PFC emissions represent a permanent alteration to the global atmosphere on human timescales. While the industries responsible for the vast majority of these emissions \u2013 aluminium smelting and semi-conductor manufacturing \u2013 have made efficiency improvements and introduced abatement measures, the global mean mole fractions of three PFCs, namely tetrafluoromethane (CF4, PFC-14), hexafluoroethane (C2F6, PFC-116) and octafluoropropane (C3F8, PFC-218), continue to grow. In this study, we update baseline growth rates using in situ high-frequency measurements from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and, using data from four European stations, estimate PFC emissions for northwest Europe. The global growth rate of CF4 decreased from 1.3 ppt yr\u22121 in 1979 to 0.6 ppt yr\u22121 around 2010 followed by a renewed steady increase to 0.9 ppt yr\u22121 in 2019. For C2F6, the growth rate grew to a maximum of 0.125 ppt yr\u22121 around 1999, followed by a decline to a minimum of 0.075 ppt yr\u22121 in 2009, followed by weak growth thereafter. The C3F8 growth rate was around 0.007 ppt yr\u22121 until the early 1990s and then quickly grew to a maximum of 0.03 ppt yr\u22121 in 2003\u20132004. Following a period of decline until 2012 to 0.015 ppt yr\u22121, the growth rate slowly increased again to \u223c 0.017 ppt yr\u22121 in 2019.
