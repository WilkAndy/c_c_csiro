The trends were compared to those from the years 1979\u20132001. All metrics considered showed a trend towards reduced ozone depletion since 2001, at significance levels ranging from 2.4 to 3.9 standard errors of the trend after the adjustment was performed. The adjustment for meteorological variability had little effect on the values of the trends but did substantially reduce the scatter and, therefore, uncertainty of the trends."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10710013570932687686", "cites_id": ["10710013570932687686"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/es/es19020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RkMOQ5mcoZQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
