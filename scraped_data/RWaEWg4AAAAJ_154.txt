SGGs are covered by Australia\u2019s emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020) and the Paris Agreement (2021-2030). Both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement are legally-binding instruments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). HFCs are used extensively in Australia, largely in air conditioning and refrigeration, initially as \u2018ozonefriendly\u2019replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Minor uses of HFCs in Australia are as aerosol propellants, including metered dose inhalers (MDIs), as foam blowing agents, solvents, in fire extinguishers and others.Increasing HFC emissions are seen as a significant driver of climate change over the next 50 years (Velders et al., 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015; Estrada et al., 2013; Harris, Wuebbles et al., 2014; Myhre et al., 2014; Rigby et al., 2014). The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol entered into force 1 January 2019 and mandates a phase-down schedule for HFC production and consumption. With global adherence to this Amendment, radiative forcing from HFCs is expected to reduce from 0.22-0.25 W m-2 in the baseline scenario from Velders et al., 2015 to 0.13 W m-2 in 2050 (Montzka and Velders, 2018)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2672555971379087493", "cites_id": ["2672555971379087493"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/report-sgg-2019.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hUhmBH_TFiUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4}}
