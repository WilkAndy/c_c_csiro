We use measurements on archived air samples and in situ observations from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and a box model of the global atmosphere to show a global increase of SO2F2 mole fraction from 0.3 \u00b1 0.02 to 2.5 \u00b1 0.08 ppt along with a global increase in emissions from 0.5 \u00b1 0.4 Gg yr\u22121 to 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 Gg yr\u22121 from 1978 to 2019. Based on a hybrid model incorporating bottom\u2010up industry data and a top\u2010down downscaling approach, we estimate the spatial distribution and trend in SO2F2 regional emissions between 2000 and 2019 and propose that the global emissions increase is driven by the growing use of SO2F2 in structural fumigation in North America and in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6539184566253243516", "cites_id": ["6539184566253243516"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JD034327", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fMw9iLfZv1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
