Their atmospheric concentrations are in decline, thanks to global production and consumption controls imposed by the Montreal Protocol. In recent years, the rates of decline of CFC atmospheric concentrations, especially for CFC-11 (CCl3F), are not as large as anticipated under the Protocol, resulting in renewed efforts to estimate CFC consumption and/or emissions to possibly identify new or poorly quantified sources. Abstract Australian emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been estimated from atmospheric CFC observations by both inverse modelling and interspecies correlation techniques, and from CFC production, import and consumption data compiled by industry and government. Australian and global CFC emissions show similar temporal behaviour, with emissions peaking \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8766933216176797231", "cites_id": ["8766933216176797231"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en19322", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L3bKl09nqnkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
