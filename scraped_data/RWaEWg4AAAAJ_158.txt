The 2017 ozone hole was associated with relatively high-ozone concentrations over the Antarctic region compared to other years, and our analysis ranked it in the smallest 25% of observed ozone holes in terms of size. The severity of stratospheric ozone loss was comparable with that which occurred in 2002 (when the stratospheric vortex exhibited an unprecedented major warming) and most years prior to 1989 (which were early in the development of the ozone hole). Disturbances to the polar vortex in August and September that were associated with intervals of anomalous planetary wave activity resulted in significant erosion of the polar vortex and the mitigation of the overall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8815089907684768827", "cites_id": ["8815089907684768827"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/es/ES19019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O3yuEpF9VXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
