Equatorial sea surface temperatures in the Pacific warmed through the season, and the South ern Oscillation just exceeded El Ni\u00f1o thresholds. However, although trade wind strength weakened at times, particularly late in the season, tropical cloudiness near the Date Line and trade wind strength were more often close to average, suggesting the atmosphere was still not firmly linked with the warmer ocean be low. The negative Indian Ocean Dipole values of winter flipped to neutral or weakly positive values through spring. Pressures in the Australian and Maritime Continent regions were high. Around Antarctica, sea ice reached a record extent in September, with expansion most prominent in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7094031607531542910", "cites_id": ["7094031607531542910"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/es/ES15018", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fplPSCkQc2IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
