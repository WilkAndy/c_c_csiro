Based on analysis of 33 years of satellite records, we find that the ozone hole of 2012 was one of the least severe since the late 1980s in terms of maximum area, minimum ozone level and total ozone deficit. In particular, the estimated integrated ozone mass effectively depleted within the ozone hole of 2012 was approximately 720 Mt, which is the 12th smallest deficit on record and 28 per cent of the peak deficit observed in 2006. The key factor in limiting the extent of Antarctic ozone loss in 2012 was the relatively warm temperatures that occurred in the Antarctic stratosphere from early July. These warm temperatures, which were driven by dynamical activity, limited the activation of ozone depletion chemistry within the polar \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:kuK5TVdYjLIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10377753103118187749", "cites_id": ["10377753103118187749"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/es/ES14028", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5TwRrnYvBZAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
