Australian PFC emissions have been calculated assuming the PFC emissions from the SE Australian smelters are representative of all Australian smelters (scaled by aluminium production). The atmospheric observations show that Australian PFC emissions from the aluminium industry are declining, consistent with the PFC emissions that are reported by the Australian government in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) and submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The data suggest that the aluminium industry is the major, if not the sole, source of CF4 emissions in Australia, whereas there appear to be multiple sources \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11267398613689778913", "cites_id": ["11267398613689778913"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11267398613689778913&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4UK1h1fXXZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
