At the lower levels there was an abrupt change in microphysical and thermodynamic properties from the updraught region to the environment. At the upper level the change was more gradual and extended over a larger region, indicating the spreading out of the convective region underneath the strong inversion capping the boundary layer. Precipitation was observed at all levels, even in the convective region except near its centre core. Vertical\u2010velocity fluctuations in the convective region near the inversion were indistinguishable from the surroundings. At these high levels the horizontal wind in the convective region was from the same direction as the air close to the surface, but was at an angle of up to 60\u00b0 with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14425266578034885176", "cites_id": ["14425266578034885176"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49712353709", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OIIVPobXMMgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
