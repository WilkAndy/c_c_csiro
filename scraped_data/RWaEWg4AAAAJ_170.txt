Here we examine the general characteristics of the 2020 Antarctic ozone hole using a variety of observational and reanalysis data and compare and contrast its behaviour with earlier years. The main feature of the 2020 ozone hole was its relatively large size, and persistence to the beginning of the 2020/2021 summer, with new maximum records being set for the ozone hole daily area and ozone mass deficit during November and December. This was in strong contrast to 2019 when the ozone hole was one of the smallest observed. We show that a key factor in 2020 was the relative stability and strength of the stratospheric polar vortex, which allowed low temperatures in the Antarctic lower stratosphere to enhance ozone depletion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12476847484521044211", "cites_id": ["12476847484521044211"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ES/ES21015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:81ial66qJq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 5}}
