In this study, we simulate atmospheric N 2 O using an atmospheric chemistry-transport model (ACTM), and the results are first compared with the in situ measurements. Five combinations of known (a priori) N 2 O emissions due to natural soil, agricultural land, other human activities, and sea\u2013air exchange are used. The N 2 O lifetime is 127.6\u00b14.0 yr in the control ACTM simulation (range indicates interannual variability). Regional N 2 O emissions are optimized using Bayesian inverse modeling for 84 partitions of the globe at monthly intervals, using measurements at 42 sites around the world covering 1997\u20132019. The best estimated global land and ocean emissions are 12.99\u00b10.22 TgN yr\u2212 1 and 2.74\u00b10.27 TgN yr\u2212 1, respectively, for 2000\u20132009, and 14.30\u00b10.20 TgN yr\u2212 1 and 2.91\u00b10.27 TgN yr\u2212 1, respectively, for 2010\u20132019. On regional scales, we find that the most recent ocean emission estimation, with lower emissions in the Southern Ocean regions, fits better with that predicted by the inversions. Marginally higher (lower) emissions than the inventory/model for the tropical (extratropical) land regions are estimated and validated using independent aircraft observations. Global land and ocean emission variabilities show a statistically significant correlation with El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Analysis of regional land emissions shows increases over America (Temperate North, Central, and Tropical), Central Africa, and Asia (South, East \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:KNjnJ3z-R6IC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1245899225918800268", "cites_id": ["1245899225918800268"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj/100/2/100_2022-018/_article/-char/ja/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jAHTsr5SShEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
