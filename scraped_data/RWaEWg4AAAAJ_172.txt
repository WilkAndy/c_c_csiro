It outlines schedules for the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), chlorinated solvents, halons, and methyl bromide. As a result of this phase-out, alternative chemicals and procedures were developed by industry for use in many applications including refrigeration, air-conditioning, foam-blowing, electronics, medicine, agriculture, and fire protection. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were used as ODS alternatives in many of these applications because they were suitable substitutes and they do not contain ozone-depleting chlorine or bromine; in addition, most HFCs have smaller climate impacts per molecule than the most widely used ODSs they replaced. Long-lived HFCs, CFCs, and HCFCs, however, are all potent greenhouse gases, and concerns were raised that uncontrolled future use of HFCs would lead to substantial climate warming. As a result of these concerns, HFCs were included as one group of greenhouse gases for which emissions controls were adopted by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Consequently, developed countries (those listed in Annex I to this Convention, or \u201cAnnex I\u201d Parties) supply annual emission estimates of HFCs to the UNFCCC. Since the Kyoto Protocol only specified limits on the sum of all controlled greenhouse gases, emissions of HFCs were not explicitly controlled. However, following the Kyoto Protocol, some countries enacted additional controls specifically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10973235707408253771,6674711078808011168", "cites_id": ["10973235707408253771", "6674711078808011168"], "pub_url": "https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/378091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S4OzuLzDSJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
