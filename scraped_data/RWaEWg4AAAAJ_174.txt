Based on analysis of 34 years of satellite records spanning 1979-2013 (which excludes 1995), we find that in terms of maximum area, minimum ozone level and total ozone deficit, the ozone hole in 2013 was typical of other years of moderate ozone loss. The estimated integrated ozone mass effectively depleted within the ozone hole of 2013 was approximately 1037 Mt, which was the 17th largest deficit on record and 41% of the peak deficit observed in 2006. Anomalously cold winter temper atures in the lower stratosphere over Antarctica and concurrent strong and stable vortex conditions favoured the potential for strong ozone depletion in 2013. However, anomalous warming of the polar vortex that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4468745750796565894", "cites_id": ["4468745750796565894"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mo/ES15017", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hv3De5UsBD4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 4}}
