The Pacific basin saw a return to neutral ENSO conditions, with slightly warmer than normal equatorial SSTs just east of the date line and neutral SOI and multivariate ENSO indices. The Australian rainfall pattern was indicative of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, with much of South Australia and other eastern Australian States experiencing much drier than normal conditions. Much of Western Australia, however, had a wetter than normal spring. November 2012 saw much of Australia\u2019s east and south experience one of the most significant spring heatwaves on record which, together with the dry conditions, would leave this area of the continent vulnerable to summer bushfires.
