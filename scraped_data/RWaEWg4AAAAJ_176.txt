However, biomass burning emissions from Australia remain highly uncertain. In this work, we use surface in situ, ground\u2010based total column and satellite total column observations to evaluate the ability of two global models (GEOS\u2010Chem and ACCESS\u2010UKCA) and three global biomass burning emission inventories (FINN1.5, GFED4s, and QFED2.4) to simulate carbon monoxide (CO) in the Australian atmosphere. We find that emissions from northern Australia savanna fires are substantially lower in FINN1.5 than in the other inventories. Model simulations driven by FINN1.5 are unable to reproduce either the magnitude or the variability of observed CO in northern Australia. The remaining two inventories perform similarly in reproducing the observed variability \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2468821685517768027", "cites_id": ["2468821685517768027"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JD035925", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W1URGz4EQyIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
