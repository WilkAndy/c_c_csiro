Chem. Phys. Discuss", "abstract": "As the second most populous country and third fastest growing economy, India has emerged as a global economic power. As such, its emissions of greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases are of global significance. However, unlike neighbouring China, the Indian sub-continent is very poorly monitored by atmospheric measurement networks. India\u2019s halocarbon emissions (here defined as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and chlorocarbons) are not well-known. Previous measurements from the region have been obtained at observatories many hun-5 dreds of kilometres from source regions, or at high altitudes, limiting their value for the estimation of regional emission rates. Given the projected rapid growth in demand for refrigerants and solvents in India, emission estimates of these halocarbons are urgently needed to provide a benchmark against which future changes can be evaluated. In this study, we report the first atmospheric-measurement derived halocarbon emissions from India. Air samples were collected at low-altitude during an aircraft campaign in June and July 2016 and emissions were derived from measurements of these samples using an inverse 10 modelling framework. These results were evaluated to assess India\u2019s progress in phasing out ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol. India\u2019s combined CFC emissions are estimated to be 54 (27\u201386) Tg CO2eq yr\u2212 1. HCFC-22 emissions of 7.8 (6.0\u20139.9) Gg yr\u2212 1 are of similar magnitude to emissions of HFC-134a (8.2 (6.1\u201310.7) Gg yr\u2212 1). We estimate India\u2019s HFC-23 emissions to be 1.2 (0.9\u20131.5) Gg yr\u2212 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15782330918073818663", "cites_id": ["15782330918073818663"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2018-1146/acp-2018-1146.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J150A1oaBtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 3, "2020": 2}}
