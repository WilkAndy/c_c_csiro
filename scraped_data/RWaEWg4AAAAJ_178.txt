However, significant persistent global ODS emissions remain (Montzka & Reimann, 2011) and will potentially delay the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole (Bekki & Bodeker, 2011). Methyl chloride (CH3Cl), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), trichloroethylene (TCE: CHClCl2), perchloroethylene (PCE: CCl2CCl2), dibromomethane (CH2Br2) and bromoform (CHBr3) are not formally listed as ODSs in a Montreal Protocol context, because CH3Cl, CHCl3, CH2Br2 and CHBr3 are predominantly natural in origin, and CH2Cl2, TCE and PCE, although largely anthropogenic in origin, have very short atmospheric lifetimes (< 0.5 yr, Montzka & Reimann, 2011) and therefore relatively low Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs). They are considered in this report in the context of their potential contribution to Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC), the ultimate driver of stratospheric ozone depletion (Bekki & Bodeker, 2011; Fraser et al., 2013; Montzka & Reimann, 2011). In addition, ODS emissions are playing an important role globally in contributing to radiative forcing by GHGs, which largely drives climate change (Forster & Ramaswamy, 2007).The most dramatic demonstration of the environmental impact of EESC is the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15902848269245712617", "cites_id": ["15902848269245712617"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/australian-ods-sgg-emissions.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6YhTdT5EstwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
