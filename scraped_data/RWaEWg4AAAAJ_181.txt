However, significant, persistent ODS emissions remain (Montzka et al., 2018; Engel and Rigby, 2018; Rigby et al., 2019), particularly CFC-11 from East Asia. If this current increase in globally significant CFC-11 emissions were to continue, it could delay recovery of mid-latitude and Antarctic ozone depletion by about 7 and 20 years respectively. Avoiding these increased CFC-11 emissions could have a larger positive impact on stratospheric ozone than any other policy option considered in the latest assessment of stratospheric ozone depletion, including destruction of the CFC bank (Carpenter, Daniel et al. 2018).Methyl chloride (CH3Cl), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), trichloroethylene (TCE: CHClCl2), perchloroethylene (PCE: CCl2CCl2), dibromomethane (CH2Br2), bromoform (CHBr3) and methyl iodide (CH3I) are not listed as ODSs in a Montreal Protocol context, because methyl chloride, chloroform, dibromomethane, bromoform and methyl iodide are predominantly natural in origin, and dichloromethane, trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, although largely anthropogenic in origin, have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (< 0.5 yr, Montzka and Reimann, 2011) and therefore relatively low Ozone Depleting Potentials (ODPs). They are considered in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:43bX7VzcjpAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16941163607828430220", "cites_id": ["16941163607828430220"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/system/files/resources/4d3fcc2c-cae7-4138-95c1-4f5e418d7a5e/files/ozone-depleting-substances-report-2019.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jH1jDosaG-sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
