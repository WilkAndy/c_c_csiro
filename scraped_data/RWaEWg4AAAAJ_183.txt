Furthermore, the chapter updates information about ODSs not controlled under the Protocol, such as methyl chloride (CH3Cl) and very short-lived substances (VSLSs). In addition to depleting stratospheric ozone, many ODSs are potent greenhouse gases.Mole fractions of ODSs and other species are primarily measured close to the surface by global or regional monitoring networks. The surface data can be used to approximate a mole fraction representative of the global or hemispheric tropospheric abundance. Changes in the tropospheric abundance of an ODS result from a difference between the rate of emissions into the atmosphere and the rate of removal from it."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=984712259788429014", "cites_id": ["984712259788429014"], "pub_url": "https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/299913/1/Chapter_1_from%20Scientific-Assessment-of-Ozone-Depletion-2022.pdf", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4}}
