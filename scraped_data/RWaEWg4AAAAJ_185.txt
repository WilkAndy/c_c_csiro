Although the polar vortex was relatively stable in 2014 and persisted some weeks longer into November than was the case in 2012 or 2013, the vortex temperature was close to the long-term mean in September and October with modest warming events occurring in both months, preventing severe depletion from taking place. Of the seven metrics reported here, all were close to their respective median values of the 1979\u20132014 record, being ranked between 16th and 21st of the 35 years for which adequate satellite observations exist."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11057784661659593723", "cites_id": ["11057784661659593723"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ES/ES19023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-6v7KJAkdZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
