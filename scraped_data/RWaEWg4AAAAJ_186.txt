The resulting APONCP signal is compared to satellite and ocean model\u2010based estimates of POC export and NCP across the Southern Ocean. The satellite products underestimate the amplitude of the observed APONCP seasonal cycle by more than a factor of 2. Ocean models suggest two reasons for this underestimate: (1) Current satellite products substantially underestimate the magnitude of NCP in early spring. (2) Seasonal O2 outgassing is supported in large part by storage of carbon in DOC and living biomass. More DOC observations are needed to help evaluate this latter model prediction. Satellite products could be improved by developing seasonally dependent relationships between remote sensing chlorophyll data and in situ NCP \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9267599483809724965", "cites_id": ["9267599483809724965"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018gl079575", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JXoS8aAgnYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
