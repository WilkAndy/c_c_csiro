Subsequently, a two-step radon-only approach for estimating \u2018baseline\u2019constituent concentrations on monthly timescales is proposed. Based on a stringent\u2264 40 mBq m-3 radon threshold followed by a simple 10th/90th percentile constituent outlier removal, the technique is completely independent of meteorological or aerosol observations. An initial evaluation of the technique using hourly CO2 and O3 records yielded monthly \u2018baseline\u2019concentration estimates more consistent with expectations of minimally perturbed Southern Ocean air masses than those produced using contemporary baseline selection techniques."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5159902135332602443", "cites_id": ["5159902135332602443"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott-Chambers/publication/280028388_A_RADON-ONLY_TECHNIQUE_FOR_CHARACTERISING_ATMOSPHERIC_'BASELINE'_CONSTITUENT_CONCENTRATIONS_AT_CAPE_GRIM/links/55a4886108ae81aec912f532/A-RADON-ONLY-TECHNIQUE-FOR-CHARACTERISING-ATMOSPHERIC-BASELINE-CONSTITUENT-CONCENTRATIONS-AT-CAPE-GRIM.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S4JHXKenm0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
