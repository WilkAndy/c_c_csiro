Sulfuryl fluoride is a replacement for methyl bromide, having zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) but a significant global warming potential (GWP: 4800, Muhle et al. 2009)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=189305518457730224", "cites_id": ["189305518457730224"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/dsewpac-research-project-2011-csiro-approved-publication.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sLSxtV2MoAIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
