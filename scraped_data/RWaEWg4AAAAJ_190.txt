HCFC-141b is a controlled substance under the Montreal Protocol, and its phase-out is currently underway, after a peak in reported consumption and production in developing (Article 5) countries in 2013. If reported production and consumption are correct, our study suggests that the 2017\u20132021 rise is due to an increase in emissions from the bank when appliances containing HCFC-141b reach the end of their life, or from production of HCFC-141b not reported for dispersive uses. Regional emissions have been estimated between 2017\u20132020 for all regions where measurements have sufficient sensitivity to emissions. This includes the regions of northwestern Europe, east Asia, the United States and Australia, where emissions decreased by a total of 2.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121, compared to a mean global increase of 3.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 over the same period. Collectively these regions only account for around 30\u2009% of global emissions in 2020. We are not able to pinpoint the source regions or specific activities responsible for the recent global emission rise."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4883965550913938819", "cites_id": ["4883965550913938819"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/22/9601/2022/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g2V4zcpUx0MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
