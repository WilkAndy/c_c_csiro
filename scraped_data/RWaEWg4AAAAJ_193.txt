From this, we find an increase of atmospheric methane total columns that amounts to 0.31\u00b10.03% year-1 (2-sigma level of uncertainty) for the 2005\u20132014 period. Comparisons with in situ methane measurements at both local and global scales show good agreement. We used the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model tagged simulation that accounts for the contribution of each emission source and one sink in the total methane, simulated over the 2005\u20132012 time period and based on emissions inventories and transport.
