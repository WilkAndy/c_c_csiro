Nevertheless, this atmospheric concentration decline suffered a slow-down around 2012 due to emissions from non-reported production. Since CFC-11 is one of the most important ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), its continuous monitoring is essential. We present the CFC-11 total column time series (2000\u20132020) retrieved in a consistent way from ground-based high-resolution solar absorption Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. These observations were recorded at two remote stations of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC): the Jungfraujoch station (Northern Hemisphere) and the Lauder station (Southern Hemisphere). These time series are new. They were produced using improved line parameters and merged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14128431597419912881", "cites_id": ["14128431597419912881"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2022/ea/d2ea00060a", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sV6epa5FEsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
