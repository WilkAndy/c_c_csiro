However, significant, persistent ODS emissions remain (Montzka & Reimann, 2011; Carpenter and Reimann, 2014), particularly in the developing world. If these emissions could be reduced to zero by 2015, then ozone recovery dates at mid-latitudes and over Antarctica could be brought forward by more than a decade (2047\u2192 2036, mid-latitudes; 2073\u2192 2061, Antarctic; Bekki & Bodeker, 2011; Dameris & Godin-Beekmann, 2014; Harris & Wuebbles, 2014).Methyl chloride (CH3Cl), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), trichloroethylene (TCE: CHClCl2), perchloroethylene (PCE: CCl2CCl2), dibromomethane (CH2Br2), bromoform (CHBr3) and methyl iodide (CH3I) are not formally listed as ODSs in a Montreal Protocol context, because methyl chloride, chloroform, dibromomethane, bromoform and methyl iodide are predominantly natural in origin, and dichloromethane, TCE and PCE, although largely anthropogenic in origin, have relatively short atmospheric lifetimes (< 0.5 yr, Montzka & Reimann, 2011) and therefore relatively low Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs). They are considered in this report in the context of their potential contribution to Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC), the ultimate driver of stratospheric ozone \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14579031948541199211", "cites_id": ["14579031948541199211"], "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/australian-global-emissions-ods-2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a4PebVAgU8oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
