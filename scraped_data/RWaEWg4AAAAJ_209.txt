Observations were drawn from 5 different networks, incorporating 59 surface sites and a number of ship-based measurement series. To avoid biases in the inverted fluxes, the data were adjusted to a common scale and scale offsets were 5 included in the optimization problem. The fluxes were calculated at the same resolution as the transport model (3.75\u25e6 longitude\u00d7 2.5\u25e6 latitude) and at monthly time resolution. Over the 11yr period, the global total N2O source varied from 17.5 to 20.1 Tga\u2212 1 N. Tropical and subtropical land regions were found to consistently have the highest N2O emissions, in particular, in South Asia (20% of global total), South America (13%) and 10 Africa (19%), while emissions from temperate regions were smaller, Europe (6%) and North America (7%). A significant multi-annual trend in N2O emissions (0.045 Tga\u2212 2 N) from South Asia was found and confirms inventory estimates of this trend. Considerable inter-annual variability in the global N2O source was observed (0.8 Tga\u2212 1 N, 1 standard deviation, SD) and was largely driven by variability in tropical and subtropical 15 soil fluxes, in particular in South America (0.3 Tga\u2212 1 N, 1 SD) and to a lesser extent in Africa (0.3 Tga\u2212 1 N, 1 SD). Notable variability was also found for N2O fluxes in the tropical and southern oceans (0.15 and 0.2 Tga\u2212 1 N, 1 SD, respectively). Inter-annual variability in the N2O source correlates strongly with ENSO, where El Ni\u00f1o conditions are associated with lower N2O fluxes from soils and from the ocean and vice-versa for 20 La Ni\u00f1a conditions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9869563107745212410", "cites_id": ["9869563107745212410"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=74090a31d745998c2ff9a3d8fc936e9fd207d263", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-id09Vq794gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
