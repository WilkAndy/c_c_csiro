The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), the second-most abundant chlorofluorocarbon, has declined substantially since the mid-1990s. A recently reported slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012, however, suggests that global emissions have increased,. A concurrent increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia contributes to the global emission increase, but the location and magnitude of this regional source are unknown. Here, using high-frequency atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with global monitoring data and atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, we investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 188, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5168403778331610018", "cites_id": ["5168403778331610018"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1193-4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ogs-X9rbuUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 23, "2020": 55, "2021": 53, "2022": 38, "2023": 13}}
