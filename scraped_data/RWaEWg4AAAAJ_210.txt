OMI continues the NASA TOMS satellite record for total ozone and other atmospheric parameters related to ozone chemistry and climate.In 2008, stripes of bad data began to appear in the OMI products apparently caused by a small physical obstruction in the OMI instrument field of view and is referred to as a row anomaly. NASA scientists guess that some of the reflective Mylar that wraps the instrument to provide thermal protection has torn and is intruding into the field of view. On 24 January 2009 the obstruction suddenly increased and now partially blocks an increased fraction of the field of view for certain Aura orbits, which led to the larger stripes of bad data in the OMI images. Since 5 July 2011, the row anomaly that manifested itself on 24 January 2009 now affects all Aura orbits, which can be seen as thick white stripes of bad data in the OMI total column ozone images. Affected data have been flagged and removed from the images. However, once the polar night reduced enough each year then this was not an issue for determining ozone hole metrics, as there is more overlap of the satellite passes at the polar regions which essentially \u2018fills-in\u2019these missing data."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5427371889731293228", "cites_id": ["5427371889731293228"], "pub_url": "https://refrigerantreclaim.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2011-Antarctic-Ozone-Hole-Final-Summary-Mar-2012.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LNBfb_rlUUsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
