We present optimized emissions from 1973-present of three perfluorocarbons: tetrafluoromethane (CF4), hexafluoroethane (C2F6) and octafluoropropane (C3F8). The dominant sources of the PFCs are primary aluminum and semiconductor production. CF4 also has a significant pre-industrial abundance from the build-up of very small natural emissions. The inversions were performed with atmospheric measurements made by the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network as well as using stored samples from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Southern Hemisphere archive and from several Northern Hemisphere sources. Inverse estimates of surface flux were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8340460348628182717", "cites_id": ["8340460348628182717"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFM.A31E0175G/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vaY2V39Ev3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1}}
