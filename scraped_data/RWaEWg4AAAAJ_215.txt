Our study describes an operational method to improve the performance in comparison to previous publications on this analytical instrument. By using a calibration technique that reflected the principle of identical treatment of sample and reference gases, we achieved a reproducibility of 0.07\u2009\u2030 for \u03b413C-CO2 and 0.06\u2009\u2030 for \u03b418O-CO2 over multiple days. This performance is within the extended compatibility goal of 0.1\u2009\u2030 for both \u03b413C-CO2 and \u03b418O-CO2, which was recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Further improvement in measurement performance is desirable to also meet the WMO network compatibility goals of 0.01\u2009\u2030 for \u03b413C-CO2 and 0.05\u2009\u2030 for \u03b418O-CO2, which is needed to resolve the small variability that is typical for background air observatories such as Baring Head.One objective of this study was to assess the capabilities and limitations of the IRIS analyser to resolve \u03b413C-CO2 and \u03b418O-CO2 variations under field conditions. Therefore, we selected multiple events within the 26\u2009d record for Keeling plot analysis. This resolved the isotopic composition of endmembers with an uncertainty of \u2264\u20091\u2009\u2030 when the magnitude of CO2 signals is larger than 10\u2009ppm. The uncertainty of the Keeling plot analysis strongly increased for smaller CO2 events (2\u20137\u2009ppm), where the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15552930869142324905", "cites_id": ["15552930869142324905"], "pub_url": "https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/15/1631/2022/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qYZv9zgc19cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
