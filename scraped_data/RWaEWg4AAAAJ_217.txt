The FTIR retrievals were carried out with the SFIT4 retrieval program, and the two spectral windows of 1138.5\u20131148.0\u2009cm\u22121 and 1154.0\u20131160.0\u2009cm\u22121 in the overlapping \u03bd2 and \u03bd5 vibrational\u2013rotational transition bands of HFC-23 were used to avoid strong H2O absorption features. We considered O3, N2O, CH4, H2O, HDO, CFC-12 (CCl2F2), HCFC-22 (CHClF2), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) (CH3C(O)OONO2), HCFC-141b (CH3CCl2F), and HCFC-142b (CH3CClF2) to be interfering species. Vertical profiles of H2O, HDO, and CH4 are preliminarily retrieved with other independent spectral windows because these profiles may induce large uncertainties in the HFC-23 retrieval. Each HFC-23 retrieval has only one piece of vertical information with sensitivity to HFC-23 in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Retrieval errors mainly arise from the systematic uncertainties of the spectroscopic parameters used to obtain HFC-23, H2O, HDO, and CH4 abundances. For comparison between FTIR-retrieved HFC-23 total columns and surface dry-air mole fractions provided by AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment), FTIR-retrieved HFC-23 dry-air column-averaged mole fractions (XHFC-23) were calculated. The FTIR-retrieved XHFC-23 values at Rikubetsu and Syowa Station have negative biases of \u221215\u2009% to \u221220\u2009% and \u221225 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:PyEswDtIyv0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12257088920723537967", "cites_id": ["12257088920723537967"], "pub_url": "https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/5955/2021/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L0AavG7tGaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
