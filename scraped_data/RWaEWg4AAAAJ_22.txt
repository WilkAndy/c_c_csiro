AGAGE is distinguished by its capability to measure globally, at high frequency, and at multiple sites all the important species in the Montreal Protocol and all the important non-carbon-dioxide (non-) gases assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( is also measured at several sites). The scientific objectives of AGAGE are important in furthering our understanding of global chemical and climatic phenomena. They are the following: (1) to accurately measure the temporal and spatial distributions of anthropogenic gases that contribute the majority of reactive halogen to the stratosphere and/or are strong infrared<?pagebreak page986?> absorbers (chlorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons \u2013 CFCs, bromocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons \u2013 HCFCs, hydrofluorocarbons \u2013 HFCs and polyfluorinated compounds (perfluorocarbons \u2013 PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride \u2013 , sulfuryl fluoride \u2013 , and sulfur hexafluoride \u2013 ) and use these measurements to determine the global rates of their emission and/or destruction (i.e., lifetimes); (2) to accurately measure the global distributions and temporal behaviors and determine the sources and sinks of non- biogenic\u2013anthropogenic gases important to climate change and/or ozone depletion (methane \u2013 , nitrous oxide \u2013 , carbon monoxide \u2013 CO, molecular hydrogen \u2013 , methyl chloride \u2013 , and methyl bromide \u2013 ); (3) to identify new long-lived greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases (e.g.,  \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7197574080519770643", "cites_id": ["7197574080519770643"], "pub_url": "https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/10/985/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:E5Lw6X3r4mMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 25, "2020": 34, "2021": 50, "2022": 47, "2023": 16}}
