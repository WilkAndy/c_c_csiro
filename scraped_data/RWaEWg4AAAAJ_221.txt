The sources of these VSLS are not well-constrained, with major source regions poorly monitored by existing measurement networks. Given India's rapidly growing economy, its emissions of both regulated chlorocarbons and unregulated VSLS chlorocarbons are suspected to have global significance. Furthermore, VSLS from the Asian monsoon regions have a greater impact on ozone-depletion than those emitted elsewhere due to the ability of monsoon systems to rapidly transport pollutants to the lower stratosphere. Previous atmospheric measurements of chlorocarbons from the Indian sub-continent are scarce. Here we present a new set of observations, derived from flask samples collected during a 2-month aircraft campaign in India and use these measurements to infer India's chlorocarbon emissions. We show that emissions of carbon tetrachloride from northern and central India (2.3\u2009(1.5\u20133.4)\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121), are likely due to inadvertent production and release during the manufacture of chloromethanes (specifically dichloromethane and chloroform) and account for approximately 7\u2009% of the global total. Emissions of methyl chloroform from the same region were estimated to be 0.07\u2009(0.04\u20130.10)\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 which account for less than 5\u2009% of remaining global emissions. We used a population scaling to estimate India's emissions of the very short-lived chlorocarbons dichloromethane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1411592616576059622", "cites_id": ["1411592616576059622"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2018-1287/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5oiUfgH8lhMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
