However, it has long been known that inaccuracies in the assumed emissions of CH3CCl3 have the potential to induce significant systematic errors in the OH levels derived using this approach. To address this, we present a Bayesian study in which uncertain parameters within a model of CH3CCl3 emissions were explored using atmospheric CH3CCl3 data. This allows us to bring the model into consistency with informative features, such as the observed inter-hemispheric gradient, and propagate any remaining uncertainties through to our OH estimates. Using this approach, we find a maximum-likelihood solution that indicates an increase in OH concentrations of around 10% between the late 1990s and mid-2000s, and a subsequent fall of similar magnitude from the mid-2000s to 2014 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15763426043186178791", "cites_id": ["15763426043186178791"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1910053R/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5-pA03fwwtoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
