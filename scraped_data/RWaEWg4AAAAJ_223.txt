To achieve this goal, emission reduction targets have been submitted by individual nations (called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, INDCs). Inventories will be used for checking progress towards these envisaged goals. These inventories are calculated by combining information on specific activities (eg passenger cars, agriculture) with activity-related, typically IPCC-sanctioned, emission factors-the so-called bottom-up method. These calculated emissions are reported on an annual basis and are checked by external bodies by using the same method. A second independent method estimates emissions by translating greenhouse gas measurements made at regionally representative stations into regional \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13510545924241502128", "cites_id": ["13510545924241502128"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.A24F..02R/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sC8EqO8Zf7sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
