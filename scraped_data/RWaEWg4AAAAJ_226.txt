The CGAA is stored at the CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere research laboratories at Aspendale, Victoria, Australia (Refer Figure 1.). The motivation for starting this archive was to create a collection of background air samples, over a long period, which at some future time could be analyzed to recover information on past atmospheric composition. Over time this unique resource has facilitated a multitude of diverse research applications,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=460418801659022565", "cites_id": ["460418801659022565"], "pub_url": "http://www.nims.go.kr/wcc/pdf/vol.6.pdf#page=18", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5QzM8HW8YwYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
