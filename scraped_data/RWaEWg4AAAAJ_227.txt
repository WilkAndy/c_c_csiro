Measurements made included non methane organic compounds (NMOCs)(PTR-MS), particle number size distribution, 5 condensation nuclei (CN)> 3 nm, black carbon (BC) concentration, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number, ozone (O3), methane (CH4), carbon monixide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), halocarbons and meteorology. During the first plume strike event (BB1), a four hour enhancement of CO (max\u223c 2100 ppb), BC (\u223c 1400 ng m\u2212 3) and particles> 3 nm (\u223c 13 000 cm\u2212 3) with dominant 10 particle mode of 120nm were observed overnight. Dilution of the plume resulted in a drop in the dominant particle mode to 50 nm, and then growth to 80 nm over 5 h. This was accompanied by an increase in O3, suggesting that photochemical processing of air and condensation of low volatility oxidation products may be driving particle growth. The ability of particles> 80 nm (CN80) to act as CCN at 0.5% supersaturation was 15 investigated. The\u2206 CCN/\u2206 CN80 ratio was lowest during the fresh BB plume (56%), higher during the particle growth event (77%) and higher still (104%) in background marine air. Particle size distributions indicate that changes to particle chemical composition, rather than particle size, are driving these changes. Hourly average CCN during both BB events were between 2000\u20135000 CCN cm\u2212 3, which were enhanced above typ-20 ical background levels by a factor of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16909014874203050009", "cites_id": ["16909014874203050009"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/15/17599/2015/acpd-15-17599-2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GVCrtnDjqOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
