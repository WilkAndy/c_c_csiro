The profile retrieval was performed by constrained nonlinear least squares fitting of measured limb spectral radiances to modelled spectra. The spectral \u03bd4-band at 816.5\u00b113 cm\u2212 1 was used for the retrieval. A Tikhonov-type smoothing constraint was applied to stabilise the retrieval. In the lower stratosphere, we find a global volume mixing ratio of HCFC-22 of about 185 pptv in January 2005. The linear growth rate in the 10 lower latitudes lower stratosphere was about 6 to 7 pptvyr\u2212 1 in the period 2005\u20132012. The obtained profiles were compared with ACE-FTS satellite data v3. 5, as well as with MkIV balloon profiles and in situ cryosampler balloon measurements. Between 13 and 22 km, average agreement within\u2212 3 to+ 5 pptv (MIPAS\u2013ACE) with ACE-FTS v3. 5 profiles is demonstrated. Agreement with MkIV solar occultation balloon-borne measure-15 ments is within 10\u201320pptv below 30km and worse above, while in situ cryosampler balloon measurements are systematically lower over their full altitude range by 15\u201350pptv below 24km and less than 10pptv above 28km. Obtained MIPAS HCFC-22 time series below 10 km altitude are shown to agree mostly well to corresponding time series of near-surface abundances from NOAA/ESRL and AGAGE networks, although 20 a more pronounced seasonal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5171782592925196593", "cites_id": ["5171782592925196593"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/15/14783/2015/acpd-15-14783-2015.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MeHa8t3cxUcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
