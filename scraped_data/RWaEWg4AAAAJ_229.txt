Report Prepared for Australian Government Department of the Environment, by the Collaboration for Australian Weather and Climate Research", "pub_year": 2015, "citation": "CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere Flagship, 2015", "author": "BL Dunse and PJ Fraser and PB Krummel and LP Steele and N Derek", "publisher": "CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere Flagship", "abstract": "Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs), which can be collectively described as Kyoto Protocol synthetic GHGs (SGGs). HFCs are used extensively in Australia, largely in air conditioning and refrigeration, initially as \u2018ozone-friendly\u2019replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Minor uses of HFCs in Australia are as aerosol propellants, including metered dose inhalers (MDIs), as foam blowing agents and in fire extinguishers. Perfluorocarbons are a by-product of the production of aluminium in Australia and overseas and, in addition, are used overseas in the electronics industry during the manufacture of integrated circuits and plasma screens. Refrigeration represents a minor use of PFCs in Australia and overseas. Sulfur hexafluoride is used extensively in the electricity distribution industry, both in Australia and overseas, for dielectric insulation and current interruption in circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment, and as a cover gas in metal production, for example magnesium. There does not appear to be any significant use of nitrogen trifluoride in Australia, which is used internationally in the semi-conductor production industry, initially as a replacement for PFCs.Sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride (CF3SF5) are potent synthetic greenhouse gases that are not part of the Kyoto Protocol suite of SGGs. Sulfuryl fluoride use in Australia is growing rapidly, as a replacement for phosphine (PH3) and possibly methyl bromide (CH3Br), in grain fumigation.
