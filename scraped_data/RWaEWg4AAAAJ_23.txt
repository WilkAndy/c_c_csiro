The precisions range from approximately 10 ppb at Mace Head, Ireland, during GAGE to better than 2 ppb at Cape Grim, Tasmania, during AGAGE (i.e., since 1993). The measurements exhibit good agreement with coincident measurements of air samples from the same locations analyzed by Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) except for differences of approximately 5 ppb before 1989 (GAGE lower) and about 4 ppb from 1991 to 1995 (GAGE higher). These results are obtained before applying a factor of 1.0119 to the GAGE/AGAGE values to place them on the Tohoku University scale. The measurements combined with a 12\u2010box atmospheric model and an assumed atmospheric lifetime of 9.1 years \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 173, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15868633867847102108", "cites_id": ["15868633867847102108"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2001JD001226", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nG7CW222ONwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 11, "2005": 11, "2006": 5, "2007": 10, "2008": 2, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 7, "2012": 11, "2013": 16, "2014": 7, "2015": 10, "2016": 13, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 4, "2020": 8, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
