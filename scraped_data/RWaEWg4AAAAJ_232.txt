Posterior methane emissions are inter-compared and evaluated with surface mole fraction measurements, via a chemistry-transport model. Sensitivity tests show that refining the assigned error statistics has a larger impact on the quality of the inverted fluxes than correcting for residual airmass-factordependent biases in the satellite retrievals. Improved configurations using TANSO-10 FTS, SCIAMACHY, IASI and surface measurements induce posterior methane global budgets of respectively, 568\u00b117 Tg yr\u2212 1, 603\u00b128 Tg yr\u2212 1, 524\u00b116 Tg yr\u2212 1 and 538\u00b120 Tg yr\u2212 1 over the one-year period August 2009\u2013July 2010. This consistency between some of these satellite retrievals and surface measurements is promising for future improvement of CH4 emission estimates by inversions. 15"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7399404599389363609", "cites_id": ["7399404599389363609"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philippe-Bousquet/publication/258738926_On_the_consistency_between_global_and_regional_methane_emissions_inferred_from_SCIAMACHY_TANSO-FTS_IASI_and_surface_measurements/links/54cbaeaa0cf298d65658a0ae/On-the-consistency-between-global-and-regional-methane-emissions-inferred-from-SCIAMACHY-TANSO-FTS-IASI-and-surface-measurements.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mZ3-h0f3r2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
