Currently, Melbourne emissions of HFC-134a and CFC-12 are both about 80 tonnes/yr. On a population basis this would mean that Australian emissions are about 400 tonnes per year. These CFC-12 emissions are likely from residual CFC in domestic refrigeration, automotive air conditioning and from land-fills.The HFC-134a emissions from Melbourne, deduced from the Cape Grim pollution episode data, are significantly lower (by a factor of 5) than the Melbourne emissions calculated by scaling the Australian emissions (2700 tonnes in 2003) in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI; AGO, 2005) on a population basis. The NGGI emissions are based on methodologies described in Burnbank (2002). For the period 2000-2005, road transport is calculated to be responsible for about 90% of HFC-134a emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:cK4Rrx0J3m0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17389981491484432459", "cites_id": ["17389981491484432459"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/fraserpj_x2005e.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SxiMygegVfEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
