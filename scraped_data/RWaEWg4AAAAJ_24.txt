In the majority of these scenes (each roughly 256 \u00d7 256 km             2             in extent)             \u03c4             and             r eff             are strongly correlated, with linear least squares yielding a regression curve of the form             r eff             \u221d             \u03c4 1/5             . This relationship is consistent with an idealized model of a nonprecipitating layer cloud in which 1) the average cloud liquid water content increases linearly with height at some fraction of the adiabatic lapse rate in a 1 km             2             vertical column, and 2) the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:S16KYo8Pm5AC", "num_citations": 149, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11127825966004568745", "cites_id": ["11127825966004568745"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/58/19/1520-0469_2001_058_2912_voodae_2.0.co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qQISIsL6bZoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 8, "2009": 3, "2010": 8, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 6}}
