The interaction of anthropogenic aerosols with these clouds plays an important role in the global energy budget. Aerosols affect cloud microphysical and radiative properties. In the Southern Ocean Cloud Experiment (SOCEX), background conditions in a pristine location were examined to learn more about the seasonal cycles of cloud properties due to natural cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Using an instrumented aircraft, this was undertaken in the winter of 1993 and the summer of 1995, to the west of Tasmania, Australia.Two case studies from SOCEX were examined, one from the winter phase (16 July 1993, SOCEX I) and one from the summer phase (8 February 1995, SOCEX II). A detailed comparison between the two case studies was undertaken with particular attention being paid to the boundary layer structure and cloud microphysics. Specifically, the thermodynamic structure of the case studies was investigated for evidence of decoupling, while the cloud microphysics was investigated for seasonal changes. Drizzle rates from the case studies were a focus of the microphysics section, with a brief examination of drizzle parameterisations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11651036848865647190", "cites_id": ["11651036848865647190"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/krummel_1998a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VpqfwUjMsKEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1}}
