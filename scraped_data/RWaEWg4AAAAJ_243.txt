A joint reconstruction based on the two Antarctic sites yields H2 levels monotonically increasing from about 350 ppb in 1900 to 550 ppb in the late 1990\u2019s, levelling off thereafter. These results are similar to individual reconstructions published previously (Patterson et al., 2020; 2021). Reconstruction of the Greenland data is complicated by a systematic bias between Tunu and the other sites. The Tunu reconstruction shows substantially lower historical H2 levels than the other two sites, a difference we attribute to possible bias in the calibration of the Tunu measurements. All three reconstructions show a late 20th century maximum in H2 levels over Greenland. A joint reconstruction of the Greenland data shows H2 levels rising 40 % from 1930\u20131990, reaching a maximum of 550 ppb. After 1990, reconstructed atmospheric H2 decrease by 6 % over the next 20 years. The reconstruction deviates by at most 4 % from the few available surface air measurements of atmospheric H2 levels over Greenland from 1998\u20132004. However, the longer instrumental records from sampling sites outside of Greenland show a more rapid decrease and stabilization after 1990 compared to the reconstruction. We explore the possibility that this difference is an artefact caused by the firn air model underestimating pore close-off induced enrichment, evidenced by a mismatch between measured and modelled Ne in firn air.
