Methane has a considerably shorter atmospheric lifetime compared to CO 2 (12 yr cf 300-1000 yr) but a higher warming potential in the atmosphere (GWP 100yr 28,(IPCC, 2014)). Most anthropogenic emissions come from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, leaks in the fossil fuel supply chain and ruminant livestock. The reduction of anthropogenic methane emissions is key to maintaining the feasibility of the Paris Agreement. The Global Methane Pledge launched at COP26 aims to reduce methane emissions by 30% relative to 2020 by 2030. Urban areas are an ideal target to reduce methane emissions given that they account for around 20% of the total emissions whilst they occupy only 3% of the land surface. Urban methane mitigations plans are proven to have a high impact reducing GHG emissions and bringing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-10725.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
