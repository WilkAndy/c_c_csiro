However, the depletion of fossil fuel resources and the detrimental environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels are driving the public opinion and governments towards renewable energy (RE) sources. Solar and wind power are the most promising, but its reliability is shadowed by their weather dependence. Hydrogen is considered as a very promising energy carrier which can overcome the limitations of the existing RE sources. Producing hydrogen at the solar panel fields or incorporating water electrolysers within wind turbines will smooth the energy supply, and even reduce the energy transport. If the hydrogen economy takes effect as anticipated, then the hydrogen impact on the climate needs to be re-assessed. In order to simulate future hydrogen concentrations, it is necessary to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:AYInfyleIOsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-16386.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
