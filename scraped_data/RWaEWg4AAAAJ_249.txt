A recent study on global HFC-23 emissions (Stanley et al., 2020) showed significant discrepancies over 2014\u20132017 between the increase in the observation-derived (top-down) emissions and the 87 % emission reduction expected from capture and destruction processes of HFC-23 at HCFC-22 production facilities mandated by national phase-out plans (bottom-up). However, the actual sources of the increased emissions were not identified. Here, we estimate the regional top-down emissions of HFC-23 for East Asia based on in situ measurements at Gosan, South Korea, and show that the HFC-23 emissions from eastern China have increased from 5.0 \u00b1 0.4 Gg yr-1 in 2008 to 9.5 \u00b1 1.0 Gg yr-1 in 2019. The continuous rise was contrary to the large emissions reduction reported since 2015 under the Chinese hydrochlorofluorocarbons production phase-out management plan (HPPMP). The magnitude of the mismatch between top-down and bottom-up estimates for 2015\u20132019 in eastern China was ~23.7 \u00b1 3.6 Gg, which accounts for 47 \u00b1 11 % of the global mismatch.Given the location of HCFC-22 production plants in eastern China and the fraction of regional to global HCFC-22 production capacities, the HFC-23 emissions rise in eastern China is most likely associated with known HCFC-22 production facilities and thus, observed discrepancies between top-down and bottom-up \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Xz60mAmATU4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-6/", "cites_per_year": {}}
