Historically, research has focused on the biogenic production of dimethyl sulfide as the primary explanation for the observed seasonal cycle in CCN and in support of the \u2018CLAW\u2019hypothesis. More recent research, however, suggests that this hypothesis is incomplete and there is a need to better understand alternate sources (eg, sea spray) and sinks (eg, coalescence scavenging) to fully constrain the CCN budget.< br> We examine the potential impact of the structure of marine boundary layer clouds on the CCN concentration through precipitation and wet deposition.   Marine boundary layer clouds dominate the lower latitudes of the Southern Ocean, specifically the various states (open, closed, disorganised) of mesoscale \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Wq2b2clWBLsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemFullPage.jsp?itemId=item_5017275_1", "cites_per_year": {}}
