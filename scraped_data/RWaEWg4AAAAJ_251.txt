Previous studies on global concentrations and emissions have mostly relied on ground-based observations. Here, we assess the global concentrations and emissions of eight MP controlled substances and methyl chloride from ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment high\u2212resolution infrared Fourier transform spectrometer) satellite observations: CFC-11 (CFCl3), CFC-12 (CF2Cl2), CCl4, HCFC-22 (CHClF2), HCFC-141b (C2H3Cl2F), HCFC-142b (C2H3ClF2), HFC-23 (CHF3), HFC-134a (C2H2F4), and CH3Cl. Results show that the ACE-FTS satellite observations can be used to derive the concentrations and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:aIdbFUkbNIkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749122017845", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AlKG3tklcUQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
