Potential changes in terrestrial N loss pathways driven by global change and spatial redistribution of N inputs are highly uncertain. We present a novel coupled soil-atmosphere isotope model (IsoTONE; ISOtopic Tracing Of Nitrogen in the Environment) to quantify terrestrial N losses and N2O emissions and emission factors for the period 1850-2020. The soil module is initialised using a global isoscape of natural soil \u03b415N values generated from measurement data using an artificial neural network. The model is optimized within a Bayesian framework using a high precision tropospheric time series of N2O isotopic composition as well as emission factor \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EGUGA..24.1150H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
