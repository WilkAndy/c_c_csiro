Long-term growth in emissions was driven by fertilization 47 and deposition, however biological fixation caused subdecadal variability in emissions. N2O 48 emission factors (EF) show large spatial variability due to climate and soil parameters. The 49 mean effective global EF for N2O (weighted by N inputs) was 4.3\u00b10.3% in 2020, much higher 50 than the land surface area-weighted mean (1.1\u00b10.1%). Climate change and redistribution 51 of fertilisation have driven an increase in global EF over the past century, which accounts 52 for 18% of the anthropogenic soil flux in 2020. Predicted increases in fertilisation in 53 emerging economies will accelerate N2O-driven climate warming in coming decades, unless 54 targeted mitigation measures focussing on fertiliser management and reduced N deposition 55 are introduced. 56"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1177877/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ixzHxhJ0RyAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
