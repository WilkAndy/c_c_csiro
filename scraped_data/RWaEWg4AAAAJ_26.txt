The boundary layer extended to a height of 400 to 700 m during this period, with its top defined by changes in the amount of turbulent mixing measured rather than by an inversion. Above the planetary boundary layer to a height of 1400 to 1900 m, a second layer was capped with a more pronounced temperature inversion and contained only intermittent turbulence. Since this layer served as a reservoir and mixing zone for boundary layer and free tropospheric air, we have called it a buffer layer to emphasize its differences from previous concepts of a residual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2205435254575652553", "cites_id": ["2205435254575652553"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97JD03437", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yd4a3K1Hmx4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 4, "1999": 19, "2000": 10, "2001": 9, "2002": 6, "2003": 11, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
