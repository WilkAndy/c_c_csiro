Understanding past perturbations to the biogeochemical cycle of H2 is useful for assessing the effects of increasing anthropogenic emissions as H2 becomes a more common energy source. Previous work utilizing Antarctic firn air has shown that H2 levels in the high southern latitudes have increased by about 40% since the mid-1800s (Patterson et al., 2020; 2021). In this work, we explore past changes in northern hemisphere H2 abundance using Greenland firn air measurements. H2 has been measured in Greenland firn air from three separate boreholes. In July 2008, firn air was sampled from two boreholes near the NEEM drilling site. The samples were analyzed for H2 by NOAA/GML and by CSIRO (Petrenko et al., 2013). Firn air was also sampled at Summit, Greenland during May \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AGUFM.C41B..04P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
