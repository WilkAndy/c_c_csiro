Here, we quantify associations between observed stratospheric and tropospheric NH\u2010SH growth rate anomalies of CFC\u201011, CFC\u201012, and N2O. We employ a chemistry climate model along with satellite and global surface station observations. Our model explains 60% of observed N2O NH\u2010SH growth rate variability from 2005 to 2019, compared to 30% for CFC\u201011% and 40% for CFC\u201012, supporting evidence that unexpected anthropogenic emissions caused sustained positive NH\u2010SH anomalies in these CFCs from 2012 to 2017. Between 2012 and 2015, the observed CFC\u201011 NH\u2010SH difference grew by 1.7 ppt; our model explains 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 ppt of this growth, but not the duration. Our model suggests that in the absence of further emission anomalies, new \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021GL093700", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hCPgOYgg4uUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
