Here, we present improved policy-relevant parameters: Fractional Release Factors (FRFs), Ozone Depletion Potentials (ODPs), and stratospheric lifetimes, for four understudied long-lived CFCs: CFC-13 (CClF 3), CFC-114 (CClF 2 CCCLF 2), CFC-114a (CCl 2 FCF 3), and CFC-115 (C 2 ClF 5). Previously derived lifetime estimates for CFC-114 and CFC-115 have substantial uncertainties, while lifetime uncertainties for CFC-13 and CFC-114a are absent from the peer-reviewed literature (Carpenter & Danie et al, 2018).This study used both observational and model data to investigate these compounds and this work derives, for the first time, observation-based lifetimes utilising measurements of air samples collected in the stratosphere. We also used a version of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) 2-D atmospheric model driven by temperature and transport fields derived from MERRA/MERRA-2 reanalysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/EGU21-4995.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gb60rxyw6s0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
