The FTIR retrievals were carried out with the SFIT4 retrieval program, and the two spectral windows of 1138.5\u20131148.0 cm-1 and 1154.0\u20131160.0 cm-1 in the overlapping \u03bd2 and \u03bd5 vibrational-rotational transition 20 bands of HFC-23 were used to avoid strong H2O absorption features. We considered O3, N2O, CH4, H2O, HDO, CFC-12 (CCl2F2), HCFC-22 (CHClF2), PAN (CH3C (O) OONO2), HCFC-141b (CH3CCl2F), and HCFC-142b (CH3CClF2) as interfering species. Vertical profiles of H2O, HDO, and CH4 are preliminarily retrieved with other independent spectral windows because these profiles may induce large uncertainties in the HFC-23 retrieval. Each HFC-23 retrieval has only one piece of vertical information with sensitivity to HFC-23 in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. The retrieval errors mainly arise from 25 the systematic uncertainties of the spectroscopic parameters used to obtain the HFC-23, H2O, HDO, and CH4 abundances. For comparison between FTIR-retrieved HFC-23 total columns and surface dry-air mole fractions provided by AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment), the FTIR-retrieved HFC-23 dry-air column-averaged mole fractions (XHFC-23) were calculated. The FTIR-retrieved XHFC-23 at Rikubetsu and Syowa Station have negative biases compared to AGAGE datasets.
