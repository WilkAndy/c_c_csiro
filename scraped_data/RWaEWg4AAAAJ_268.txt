The framework is designed to bring together atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) observations from a variety of sampling platforms, prepare them with specific applications in mind, and package and distribute them in a self-consistent and well-documented product. ObsPack products are intended to support GHG budget studies and represent a new generation of cooperative value-added GHG data products. This product includes 524 atmospheric carbon dioxide datasets derived from observations made by 63 laboratories from 21 countries. Data for the period 1957-2020 (where available) are included."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repositorio.aemet.es/handle/20.500.11765/14190", "cites_per_year": {}}
