This reporting of atmospheric concentrations, temporal trends and estimated emissions of synthetic greenhouse gases is part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) program.Observations from the Cape Grim monitoring station have been used as a proxy for Australian emissions for over 25 years (Fraser et al. 2016). Cape Grim trace gas records contain information on background levels and regional pollution events. These pollution events are largely of Melbourne origin and can be scaled to represent Australian emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/report-sgg-2021.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SjHWQYi2gA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
