HCFC\u2010142b, HCFC\u2010141b, HCFC\u201022 and HFC\u2010134a show continued rapid growth in the atmosphere at mean rates of 1.1, 1.6, 6.0, and 3.4 ppt/year, respectively. Emissions inferred from measurements are compared to recent estimates from consumption data. Minor updates to the industry estimates of emissions are reported together with a discussion of how to best determine OH concentrations from these trace gas measurements. In addition, AGAGE measurements and derived emissions are compared to those deduced from NOAA\u2010Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory flask measurements (which are mostly made at different locations).
