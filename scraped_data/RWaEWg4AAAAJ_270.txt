Atmospheric observations from eastern Asia showed that at least 40-60% of the global rise originated from eastern China, where emissions increased by 7\u00b13 Gg yr-1 during 2014-2017 compared to 2008-2012. Here, we discuss updated emissions estimates of CFC-11 from this region extended to subsequent years. In addition, we present emissions estimates for the related ozone-depleting substances carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12, CCl 2 F 2), which are typically the precursor to and co-product to CFC-11, respectively. Emissions trends for these three \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:q-HalDI95KYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMA128...12W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
