The emission increase is likely the result of renewed CFC-11 production and, therefore, suggests a violation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. If emissions remain elevated in the future, a substantial delay in ozone recovery would be expected. These findings prompted a substantial international response by scientists, industry, policymakers, and non-governmental organizations to elucidate the underlying causes for this apparent breach of the Protocol and ensure that the elevated emissions and enhanced ozone depletion be minimized. Despite these efforts, the underlying causes of the emission increase, and the region (s) responsible for much of this increase and all of the renewed production remain unclear. As atmospheric scientists, our role during this secondary phase \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMA109...04M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
