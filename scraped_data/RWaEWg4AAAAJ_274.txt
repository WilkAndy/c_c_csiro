Atmospheric Transport Pathways to Antarctica elemental mercury. These differences were largely attributed to chemical processes on the Antarctic Plateau. A comparison of our observations with some Antarctic radon simulations by global climate models over the past two decades indicated that:(i) some models overestimate synoptic transport to Antarctica in the MBL,(ii) the seasonality of the Antarctic ice sheet needs to be better represented in models,(iii) coastal Antarctic radon sources need to be taken into account, and (iv) the underestimation of radon in subsiding tropospheric air needs to be investigated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=eGTPDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA51&dq=info:a00yVw1IJ74J:scholar.google.com&ots=RN0FZuAeIU&sig=KBH7mxXc9rRCpN71MEiS6fi10II", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a00yVw1IJ74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
