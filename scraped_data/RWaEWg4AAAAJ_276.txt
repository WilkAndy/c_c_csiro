It is the dominant sink for many air pollutants, ozone depleting gases, and greenhouse gases. Global measurements of methyl chloroform (MCF), which is removed by OH, have long provided an accurate method for inferring the global and hemispheric behavior of OH. However, MCF levels have been shrinking since early 2000, and therefore alternative global trace gases are needed now and in future years. Here we combine atmospheric observations of MCF, HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, HFC-32, and HFC-152a from the AGAGE surface network as well as HCFC-22 and HCFC-141b from the ACE-FTS satellite to constrain the monthly global and hemispheric behavior of tropospheric OH using a 3D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) under a Bayesian inverse framework. Global tropospheric OH trends inferred from this study are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.A11K2703P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
