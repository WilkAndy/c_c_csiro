Oceanic sources have been estimated to comprise one-third of natural emissions globally and its uncertainties are larger than for any other source. Previous estimates of ocean N 2 O fluxes have been made through oceanographic measurements and using biogeochemical models. However, emissions from coastal areas, which are thought to comprise a significant portion of the total oceanic flux, are traditionally hard to capture through these methods due to their episodic nature and limited spatial scale."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B24C..03G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
