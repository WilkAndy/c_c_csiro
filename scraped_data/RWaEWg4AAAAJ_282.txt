CH 4 is emitted from both human activities and natural sources, where the global total emissions in the 21st century are estimated to be around 526-569 Tg CH 4 per year (GCP2017). Although the global total emissions estimated by various models agree fairly well, the regional budgets and source attributions vary between the models. In this study, we estimate global and regional CH 4 emissions from a CTE-CH 4 inverse model, to better quantify the range of the estimates and emission attributions as a part of Global Carbon Project methane budget. The prior emission from anthropogenic, wetlands and peatlands, biofuels and biomass burning, termites, ocean and geological sources are taken into account, and among those, the emissions from anthropogenic and wetlands and peatlands are optimized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFM.B41H2798K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
