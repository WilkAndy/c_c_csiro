The October-January average sea surface temperatures in this region were 2 C or more above average over most of the Tasman Sea south of 35 S, and peak temperatures exceeded 6 C in places. How did this extreme event impact ocean carbon uptake and biogeochemistry, and what are the implications in a changing climate where extreme events become more frequent?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMOS31C..05M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
