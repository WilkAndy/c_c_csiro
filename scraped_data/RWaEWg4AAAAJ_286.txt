This can happen directly, as a result of synoptic transport within the marine boundary layer, or indirectly, as a result of subsiding tropospheric air that has experienced recent continental influences (eg, through convection or frontal uplift). The gradually expanding international network of continuous atmospheric Radon-222 monitors in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean not only facilitates the characterisation of baseline (\" clean\") air masses in these regions, but also enables the identification and quantification of recent (< 3-weeks) terrestrial influences on non-baseline air masses. Furthermore, a simple technique was recently developed that enables a clear distinction to be made between long-term oceanic air masses and subsiding (recently-tropospheric) air \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..2010869C/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
