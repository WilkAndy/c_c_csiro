The inversions employ the GEOS-Chem adjoint and an array of aggregation strategies to test how well current observations can constrain the spatial distribution of global N 2 O emissions. The strategies include (1) a standard 4D-Var inversion at native model resolution (4\u2218\u00d7 5\u2218),(2) an inversion for six continental and three ocean regions, and (3) a fast 4D-Var inversion based on a novel dimension reduction technique employing randomized singular value decomposition (SVD). The optimized global flux ranges from 15.9 Tg N yr-1 (SVD-based inversion) to 17.5\u201317.7 Tg N yr-1 (continental-scale, standard 4D-Var inversions), with the former better capturing the extratropical N 2 O background measured during the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) airborne campaigns. We find that the tropics provide a greater contribution to the global N 2 O flux than is predicted by the prior bottom-up inventories, likely due to underestimated agricultural and oceanic emissions. We infer an overestimate of natural soil emissions in the extratropics and find that predicted emissions are seasonally biased in northern midlatitudes. Here, optimized fluxes exhibit a springtime peak consistent with the timing of spring fertilizer and manure application, soil thawing, and elevated soil moisture. Finally, the inversions reveal a major emission underestimate in the US Corn Belt in the bottom-up inventory used here. We extensively test the impact of initial conditions on the analysis and recommend formally optimizing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/735/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XC5aA_hgSrsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
