India contains large CH4 emissions sources particularly from its intensive rice agriculture and ruminants. However, emissions from this region have been highly uncertain and this is largely due to insufficient constraints from atmospheric measurements. Compared to parts of the developed world, which are well-observed through monitoring efforts, data from India is very sparse and this is especially critical given India's importance to the global CH4 budget. Here, we used data from a variety of surface sites and aircraft campaigns collected over the past several years, in conjunction with column methane data from the GOSAT satellite, to quantify emissions at a regional scale.
