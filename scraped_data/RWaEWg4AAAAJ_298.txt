Atmospheric concentrations stabilized in the early 2000s and began increasing again in 2007. These recent trends are not well understood. There are currently multiple hypotheses proposed to explain the renewed growth of atmospheric methane since 2007. Here we demonstrate that the problem is currently under-constrained and solutions obtained in previous work are strongly dependent on assumptions made in the analysis. We infer annual hemispheric source and sink budgets for atmospheric methane using a stochastic, non-linear optimization that is constrained by atmospheric observations of methane (NOAA), methyl chloroform (NOAA, GAGE/AGAGE), and the C13/C12 ratio in atmospheric methane (\u03b413CH4; INSTAAR, U. Heidelberg, UCI, UW).
