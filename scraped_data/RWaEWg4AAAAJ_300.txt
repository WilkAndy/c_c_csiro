Premier stations in the GAW baseline network span a broad range of physical settings, from remote marine to high\u2010altitude continental sites, necessitating carefully tailored site\u2010specific requirements for baseline sampling, data selection, and analysis. Radon\u2010222 is a versatile and unambiguous terrestrial tracer, widely\u2010used in transport and mixing studies. Since the majority of anthropogenic pollution sources also have terrestrial origins, radon has become a popular addition to the \u2018baseline selection toolkit\u2019 at numerous GAW stations as a proxy for \u2018pollution potential\u2019. In the past, detector performance and postprocessing methods necessitated the adoption of a relaxed (e.g. 100 mBq m\u20103) radon threshold for minimal terrestrial influence, intended to be used in conjunction with other baseline criteria and analysis procedures, including wind speed, wind direction, particle number, outlier rejection and filtering. However, recent improvements in detector sensitivity, stability and post\u2010processing procedures have reduced detection limits below 10 mBq m\u20103 at Cape Grim and to \uf07e25 mBq m\u20103 at other baseline stations. Consequently, for suitably sensitive instruments (such as the ANSTO designed and built two\u2010filter dual\u2010flow\u2010loop detectors), radon concentrations alone can be used to unambiguously identify air masses that have been removed from terrestrial sources (at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://apo.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/9194", "cites_per_year": {}}
