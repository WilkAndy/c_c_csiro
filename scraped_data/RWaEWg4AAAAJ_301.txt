Unlike the majority of CFC-replacement compounds that are emitted from fugitive and mobile emission sources, these gases are largely emitted from large single point sources-semiconductor manufacturing facilities (all three), aluminium smelting plants (CF4) and chlorodifluoromethane factories (HFC-23). In this work we show the potential for atmospheric measurements to understand regional sources of these gases and to highlight emission'hotspots'. We target our analysis on measurements from two Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) long term monitoring sites that are particularly sensitive to regional emissions of these gases: Gosan on Jeju Island in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..18.7870A/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
