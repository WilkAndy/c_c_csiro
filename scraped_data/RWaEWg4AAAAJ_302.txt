Commencing operations in 1976, and in its current facilities since 1981, the Baseline Air Pollution Station at Cape Grim is Australia\u2019s contribution to international efforts for monitoring the global background atmosphere for trends due to human activities and natural variability. It is one of the three premier stations in the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) network of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Cape Grim observations thereby contribute very significantly to the GAW programme, and research outputs are published in peer-reviewed international journals of the highest quality, are very frequently cited, and feed into the international/global assessments, for example the IPCC. Cape Grim\u2019s essential purpose has not changed since the program\u2019s inception in 1976. National and global concern that human activity is having an impact on the composition of the global (and regional) atmosphere requires that the changes be observed and understood. Initially, this was the main focus, whereas now the data are also used for prediction, to guide development of remedial policies, and to verify the effectiveness of global mitigation actions. The critical, but too often unrecognised role of precise in-situ atmospheric observation programs underpinning our current understanding of atmospheric processes and ability to model future climate, is well summarised in a commentary in Nature, titled \u201cCinderella science\u201d (Nature 450, p789, 2007). The Cape Grim station is operated and funded by the Aust.
