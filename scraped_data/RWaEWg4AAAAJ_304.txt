These trend agree with a GEOS-Chem-tagged simulation that accounts for the contribution of each emission source and one sink in the total methane. The GEOS-Chem simulation shows that anthropogenic emissions from coal mining and gas and oil transport and exploration have played a major role in the increase methane since 2005."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:DkZNVXde3BIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://repositorio.aemet.es/handle/20.500.11765/6430", "cites_per_year": {}}
