South Asia contains some of the largest anthropogenic CH4 sources in the world, mainly from rice agriculture and ruminants. However, emissions from this region have been highly uncertain largely due to insufficient constraints from atmospheric measurements. Compared to parts of the developed world, which have well-developed monitoring networks, South Asia is very under-sampled, particularly given its importance to the global CH4 budget. Over the past few years, data have been collected from a variety of surface sites around the region, ranging from in situ to flask-based sampling. We have used these data, in conjunction with column methane data from the GOSAT satellite, to quantify emissions at a regional scale. Using the Met Office's Lagrangian NAME model, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.A52C..02G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
