The ratio of Northern Hemispheric to Southern Hemispheric (NH/SH) OH concentration is important for our understanding of emission estimates of atmospheric species such as nitrogen oxides and methane,,. It remains poorly constrained, however, with a range of estimates from 0.85 to 1.4 (refs , ,,,). Here we determine the NH/SH ratio of OH with the help of methyl chloroform data (a proxy for OH concentrations) and an atmospheric transport model that accurately describes interhemispheric transport and modelled emissions. We find that for the years 2004\u20132011 the model predicts an annual mean NH\u2013SH gradient of methyl chloroform that is a tight linear function of the modelled NH/SH ratio in annual mean OH. We estimate a NH/SH OH ratio of 0.97 \u00b1 0.12 during this time period by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10750218897113585174", "cites_id": ["10750218897113585174"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13721", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FpYlPCFzMJUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 12, "2016": 19, "2017": 18, "2018": 15, "2019": 8, "2020": 13, "2021": 23, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
