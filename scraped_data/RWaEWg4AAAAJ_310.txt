However, estimates of their relative contribution to the atmospheric CH 4 budget are highly uncertain. Models of CH 4 fluxes from wetlands, which reflect our understanding of the processes driving these fluxes, disagree strongly in their estimates of the total contribution of wetlands to the CH 4 budget and in the variability of the fluxes in space and time. Atmospheric CH 4 observations can provide a top-down constraint on wetland CH 4 flux estimates. Results from atmospheric inverse modeling studies highlight the importance of tropical wetlands in driving interannual variability of atmospheric CH_4. Nevertheless, atmospheric observations in the tropics are scarce, with large areas of strong emissions not covered by the atmospheric observation network. Furthermore, the Bayesian framework, often used in atmospheric inverse modeling \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..1713458G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
