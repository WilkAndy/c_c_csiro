However, in situ observations by aircraft are costly and cannot provide long term observations which are required for a deeper understanding of the processes. Ground based remote sensing observations have the potential to fill this gap, but their observations do not contain sufficient information to unambiguously constrain ice cloud properties which leads to high uncertainties. For vertically pointing cloud radars, usually only reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity are used for retrievals; some studies proposed also the use of Doppler spectrum width. In this study, it is investigated whether additional information can be obtained by exploiting also higher moments of the Doppler spectrum such as skewness and kurtosis together with the slope of the Doppler peak. For this, observations of pure ice clouds \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.A42C..06L/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
