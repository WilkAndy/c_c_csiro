The tropical regions globally are expected to be sensitive to future climate change due to vulnerabilities in the large carbon pools of tropical vegetation, influenced by biomass burning, deforestation and the draining of the tropical peatlands [Canadell et al., 2007]. The tropics, especially the SE Asian tropics, are a re-gion of significant transport of trace gases into the lower stratosphere. The tropical atmosphere has high photochemical activity, with high levels of ultraviolet (UV) ra-diation, hydroxyl radical (OH) and organic precursor species; the tropics have a significant impact on the chang-ing global atmosphere for reactive gases, greenhouse gases (GHGs) and related trace gases, through a wide range of processes. To understand these processes, high quality atmospheric observation programs are required in these important regions.Tropical regions are, however, the most sparsely sampled in global atmospheric observing networks. To address this deficiency, a new pilot Australian Tropical Atmospheric Research Station (ATARS) has been estab-lished in the Australian tropical region near Darwin in the Northern Territory (June 2010), a coastal site in the Tropical Warm Pool (TWP) region. The Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS) serves as the key reference site for ATARS, in addition to the expanding Australian Greenhouse Gas Observation Network (AGGON), a high precision atmos-pheric observation network for greenhouse gases (GHG) and related trace gas species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:7H_MAutzIkAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace101.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/9104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZVODeRFEZf4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
