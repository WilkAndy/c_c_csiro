We infer recent SGHG emissions and examine the impact of future emissions scenarios, with a particular focus on proposals to reduce HFC use under the Montreal Protocol. If these proposals are implemented, overall SGHG radiative forcing could peak at around 355\u2009mW\u2009m\u22122 in 2020, before declining by approximately 26% by 2050, despite continued growth of fully fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to \u201cno HFC policy\u201d projections, this amounts to a reduction in radiative forcing of between 50 and 240\u2009mW\u2009m\u22122 by 2050 or a cumulative emissions saving equivalent to 0.5 to 2.8\u2009years of CO2 emissions at current levels. However, more complete reporting of global HFC emissions is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1508289597812093621", "cites_id": ["1508289597812093621"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013GL059099", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tbIB4GWF7hQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 17, "2016": 10, "2017": 14, "2018": 14, "2019": 19, "2020": 11, "2021": 15, "2022": 7, "2023": 6}}
