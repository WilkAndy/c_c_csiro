Atmospheric in situ mole fraction measurements have been used extensively to estimate emissions of both species using \u201ctop-down\u201d assimilation or inversion schemes [eg 2, 3]. Their global annual budgets are well-constrained using these surface data, however substantive discrepancies between estimates remain at the regional/subcontinental spatial scale and in terms of seasonal cycle [eg 4]. Here we use proxy dry-air column averaged mole fractions of methane (XCH4) from GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite,[5]) together with an ensemble Kalman filter [6] and the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model [7] to infer regional monthly surface methane fluxes. We also explore the information contained in the CH4/CO2 ratio: can this ratio be used to constrain surface fluxes of both species?"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ESASP.722E.296F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
