During this time, the concentrations of all the major chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) declined significantly. In contrast, a large number of replacement gases that have high global warming potentials, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), have grown rapidly. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) levels have continued to increase, but with rates that change inter-annually. Concentrations of very long lived, potent greenhouse gases such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have also grown significantly. Using a model of atmospheric chemistry and transport, and a multi-species inverse method, we make use of the measured trends to infer global lifetimes of CFCs and global emissions of HFCs, HCFCs, CH4, N2O and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.A24A..01R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
