SO2F2 emissions have been estimated by inter-species correlation (ISC), with carbon monoxide (CO) as the reference species, and by inverse techniques using NAME/INTEM. SE Australian methyl bromide emissions (CH3Br) are now largely from quarantine/pre-shipment (QPS) use in grain storage on Australian docks, prior to export. SE Australian CH3Br emissions have been estimated by ISC and are compared to emissions from a simple UNEP \u2018bottom-up\u2019usage model that incorporates emissions factors for both QPS and non-QPS CH3Br use."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:i2xiXl-TujoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP1210257&sb=RECENT&n=9&rpp=50&page=4&tr=3888&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2012", "cites_per_year": {}}
