Since 1985 flask air samples have been collected at Cape Grim and sent to CSIRO laboratories in Aspendale for analysis by gas chromatography. Since 1993, CO has also been measured by in situ gas chromatography at Cape Grim, every 40 minutes, as part of the AGAGE program. Recently, improvements have been made to the treatment of the strongly non-linear response of the AGAGE CO instrument. The revised CO data will be presented, and compared to the CO flask data. Features of the Cape Grim CO data will also be compared to partial column (from the ground to 12 km height) CO derived from ground-based Fourier Transform Spectroscopy at Lauder, New Zealand (Zeng et al., 2012).
