Emissions for 1994-2011 have been made by interspecies correlation (ISC) with carbon monoxide (CO) as the reference species (Dunse et al., 2005). CO data from the GC-MRD instrument at Cape Grim are available back to 1994. The Cape Grim data are used to calculate emissions from the Melbourne/Port Phillip region and Australian emissions are calculated from Port Phillip emissions scaled by population. PFC-14 (CF4) emissions are scaled by aluminium production"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://refrigerantreclaim.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RRA-Report-2011_2012-November-20121.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YZPKVpc-lAYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
