These observations are both sampled flasks and continuous in-situ observations. Two inversion methods are used: the analytical method assimilates monthly observations computed from flask measurements to infer monthly methane fluxes over 11 large regions over the globe; the variational method assimilates daily continuous measurements together with flasks measurements to infer weekly fluxes at the resolution of the transport model grid cell (\u223c 3\u00d7 4\u25e6). Both inversion methods optimize OH variations using methyl-chloroform continuous observations.Methane and methyl-Chloroform observations used in our study come from various networks. We did not properly quote all observation networks in the paper. First, citations and acknowledgements for the largest network of continuous methane measurements, the AGAGE network (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment), are missing in the paper. AGAGE network and observations are described in Prinn et al.(2000) and on their website (agage. eas. gatech. edu/index. htm). In addition to the 68 measurement sites assimilated in the analytical inversion, 5 additional continuous time series of methane observations from AGAGE are used in the variational inversion (Prinn et al., 2000; Rigby et al., 2008, AGAGE website): Mace-Head,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/9381/2012/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C8OIsztjb74J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
