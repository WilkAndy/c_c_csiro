OMI continues the NASA TOMS satellite record for total ozone and other atmospheric parameters related to ozone chemistry and climate. In 2008 stripes of bad data began to appear in the OMI products, apparently caused by a small physical obstruction in the OMI instrument field of view. NASA scientists guess that some of the reflective Mylar that wraps the instrument to provide thermal protection has torn and is intruding into the field of view. On 24 January 2009 the obstruction suddenly increased and now partially blocks an increased fraction of the field of view, leading to the larger stripes of bad data that are seen in current OMI images. Affected data have been flagged and removed from the images. NASA thinks that some of the data may be recoverable, but a fix may take quite some time to create and test. However, once the polar night reduced enough then this was not an issue for determining ozone hole metrics, as there is more overlap of the satellite passes at the polar regions which essentially \u2018fills-in\u2019these missing data. In June 2009, all of the OMI ozone data were reprocessed/updated by NASA. These were subsequently processed by CSIRO, which resulted in small changes in the ozone hole metrics. In mid-2007, a corrected version of all the Earth Probe TOMS (EPTOMS) data (1996-2005) was released. The correction addressed a degradation of the scanner mirror on TOMS that \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://refrigerantreclaim.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/2010-Antarctic-Ozone-Hole-RRA-Report-2012.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hix_Q0XzKGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
