Currently, the heavy PFCs are regulated under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, no atmospheric observations or top-down emission estimates for these gases have been published. In this study, atmospheric histories of the heavy PFCs were determined through new measurements of the Cape Grim Air Archive and a collection of Northern Hemispheric archive flasks using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) cryogenic preconcentration gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system \u201cMedusa\u201d[Miller et al., 2008 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP122512&sb=RECENT&n=10&rpp=10&page=33&tr=5045&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "cites_per_year": {}}
