Despite its impact on stratospheric ozone destruction, it is not regulated under the Montreal Protocol, and global observations show a continuous N2O mole fraction increase of 0.2 to 0.3% per year. Sinks and sources of N2O still have large uncertainties but previous studies have estimated that soil emissions share more than a half of the global total. Because the variability in soil emissions could potentially have important implications for regional and global climate, and vice versa, it is essential to better understand the processes and feedbacks associated with soil N2O emissions. To achieve this goal and quantify global soil N2O emissions, we have included nitrification \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFM.B44A..06S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
