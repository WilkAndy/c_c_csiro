Currently, the heavy PFCs are regulated under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, no atmospheric observations or top-down emission estimates for these gases have been published. In this study, atmospheric histories of the heavy PFCs were determined through new measurements of the Cape Grim Air Archive and a collection of Northern Hemispheric archive flasks using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) cryogenic preconcentration gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system\" Medusa\"[Miller et \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFM.A13J..03I/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
