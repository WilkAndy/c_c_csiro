Nevertheless, they have attracted the attention of policymakers because (1) if their growth in concentrations and emissions continues unabated, particularly HFCs-currently growing at 10% per year-then they could be responsible globally (and in Australia) for more than 10% of the radiative forcing due to long-lived GHGs by 2050 (Velders et al., 2009); and (2) they provide the opportunity for a very cost-effective GHG mitigation strategy, because emissions can be reduced significantly through better engineering to minimize emissions, through a ban on dispersive uses (as solvents for example) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFM.A13J..04F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
