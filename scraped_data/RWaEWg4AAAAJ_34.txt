High-frequency records of tropospheric N2O are available from measurements at Cape Grim, Tasmania; Cape Matatula, American Samoa; Ragged Point, Barbados; Mace Head, Ireland; and at Trinidad Head, California using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) instrumentation and calibrations. The Global Monitoring Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) has also collected discrete air samples in flasks and in situ measurements from remote sites across the globe and analyzed them for a suite of species including N2O. In addition to these major networks, we include in situ and aircraft measurements from the National Institute of Environmental Studies (NIES) and flask measurements from the Tohoku University and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) networks. All measurements show increasing atmospheric mole fractions of N2O, with a varying growth rate of 0.1\u20130.7% per year, resulting in a 7.4% increase in the background atmospheric mole fraction between 1979 and 2011. Using existing emission inventories as well as bottom-up process modeling results, we first create globally gridded a priori N2O emissions over the 37 years since 1975. We then use the three-dimensional chemical transport model, Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers version 4 (MOZART v4), and a Bayesian inverse method to estimate global as well as regional annual emissions for five source \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC", "num_citations": 116, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7012101286759814732,4293604293598846119", "cites_id": ["7012101286759814732", "4293604293598846119"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/14/4617/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TNZg9vf8T2EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 19, "2019": 12, "2020": 20, "2021": 17, "2022": 16, "2023": 3}}
