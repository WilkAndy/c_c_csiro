In the CIA program, CO2 was extracted from baseline air at Cape Grim and sent to the CMAR Global Atmospheric Sampling Laboratory (GASLAB) in Aspendale for stable isotope analysis. In the CGO program, samples of air were collected in either 5.0 or 0.5 litre glass flasks and returned to GASLAB for analysis as part of the global flask network operated by GASLAB. While samples from both programs have been analysed using the same stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS), the measurement and calibration procedures used in these programs are quite different, essentially providing us with two independent records of both\uf064 13C and\uf064 18O in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP117469&sb=RECENT&n=1&rpp=10&page=63&tr=5060&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "cites_per_year": {}}
