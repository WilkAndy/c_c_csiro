In this study, global top-down emission for these PFCs are estimated from 1973-2010 based on their atmospheric histories using an inverse method and the 3-D chemical transport model Model of OZone and Related Tracers (MOZARTv4. 5). Atmospheric histories were determined through new measurements of the Cape Grim Air Archive and a collection of Northern Hemispheric flasks, using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) cryogenic preconcentration gas chromatography-mass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=csiro:EP112527&sb=RECENT&n=39&rpp=50&page=54&tr=5047&dr=all&dc4.browseYear=2011", "cites_per_year": {}}
