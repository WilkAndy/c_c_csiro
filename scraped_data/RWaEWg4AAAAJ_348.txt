All seventeen of the synthetic LLGHGs have been measured at Cape Grim since 1978, either directly or as part of the Cape Grim Air Archive (Krummel et al. 2007). The Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) has measured some of these seventeen species in its global network since the late 1990s and others since 2004 (Prinn et al. 2000). Global average concentrations of these seventen synthetic LLGHGs prior to the late 1990s can be constructed from Cape Grim data by assuming a constant ratio of Cape Grim annual average concentrations to global annual average concentrations (derived in those years where both Cape Grim and global observations are available)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cawcr.gov.au/technical-reports/CTR_036.pdf#page=67", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CJyABqcUpGMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
