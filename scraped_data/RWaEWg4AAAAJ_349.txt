Global emissions of these species were recently reported by M\u00fchle et al.(2010) using in situ measurements of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) combined with a global 12-box inversion model. The study found a discrepancy of up to~ 6 Gg/yr for CF4 in recent years between their measurement derived (top-down) and industry-reported (bottom-up) emissions, and speculated that underestimated emissions from aluminum manufacture in China could be one of the sources of this discrepancy. In this study, we use in situ measurements taken at Cape Grim (Tasmania, Australia) and Gosan (Jeju Island, Korea) within AGAGE to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.A43D0276K/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
