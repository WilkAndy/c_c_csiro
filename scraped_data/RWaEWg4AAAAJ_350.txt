We extend previous atmospheric measurements of PFC-318 in the Cape Grim Air Archive (Oram, 1999) with our new in situ measurements from remote and urban AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) and affiliated stations. Our longest in situ record is from the Jungfraujoch observatory in the Swiss Alps, and our data set is augmented by measurements of flasks from the King Sejong and Troll coastal Antarctic stations and several locations in the Northern Hemisphere. In mid-2009 we find\u223c 1.25 ppt (parts-per-trillion, dry mol fraction) in the Northern Hemisphere and\u223c 1.20 ppt in the Southern Hemisphere, with rise rates of\u223c 0.03 ppt/yr and an interhemispheric ratio of\u223c 1.04.
