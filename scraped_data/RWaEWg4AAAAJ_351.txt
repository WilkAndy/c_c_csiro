However, there is currently a great deal of uncertainty about its emissions distribution, the origins of global emissions changes and the validity of reported emissions. Atmospheric measurements will increasingly play a key role in reducing these uncertainties and in SF6 emissions verification. Here, for the first time, we derive regional'top-down'emissions between 2004 and 2008 using high-frequency in situ and flask measurements from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) networks and a three-dimensional chemical transport model. We also present new AGAGE measurements of archived air samples from Cape Grim, Tasmania and several Northern Hemisphere sites that extend the measurement \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.A43D0278R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
