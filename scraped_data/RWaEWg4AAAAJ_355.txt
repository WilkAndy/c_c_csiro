Measurements were made of archived air samples starting from 1973 in the Northern Hemisphere and from 1978 in the Southern Hemisphere, using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) systems. These measurements were combined with modern high-frequency GC-MS and GC-electron capture detection (ECD) data from AGAGE monitoring sites, to produce a unique 35-year atmospheric record of this potent greenhouse gas. Atmospheric mole fractions were found to have increased by more than an order of magnitude between 1973 and 2008. The 2008 growth rate was the highest recorded, at 0.29 \u00b1 0.02 pmolmol\u22121 [pmolmol superscript -1] yr\u22121 [yr superscript -1]. A three-dimensional chemical transport model and a minimum variance Bayesian inverse method was used to estimate annual emission rates using the measurements, with a priori estimates from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR, version 4). Consistent with the mole fraction growth rate maximum, global emissions during 2008 were also the highest in the 1973\u20132008 period, reaching 7.4 \u00b1 0.6 Gg yr\u22121 [yr superscript -1] (1-\u03c3 [1 - delta] uncertainties) and surpassing the previous maximum in 1995. The 2008 values follow an increase in emissions of 48 \u00b1 20% since 2001. A second global inversion which also incorporated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) flask measurements and in situ monitoring site data agreed well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/65647", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9w3VIvncpgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
