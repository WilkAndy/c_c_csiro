The PFC records span more than 30 years in both hemispheres-about twice the length of previous direct NH measurements, and unprecedented in the SH. The excellent precisions (< 0.3% tetrafluoromethane,< 1.5% hexafluoroethane,< 4.5% octafluoropropane) and quality of the archived air and in situ data lead to clearly defined abundances and rise rates in both hemispheres with well defined interhemispheric gradients for the first \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFM.A31E0174M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
