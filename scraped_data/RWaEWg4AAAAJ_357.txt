The model MCF loss rate due to reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radical is calculated based on an optimized OH field for MCF simulations using another transport model (TM5), and loss due to photolysis is parameterized in ACTM based on JPL published absorption cross-sections. The model simulations reconstruct the measurements at hourly, daily, monthly and interannual time scales near the surface at 5 AGAGE network sites (Mace Head, Ireland; Trinidad Head, USA; Ragged Point, Barbados; Cape Matatula, American Samoa; Cape Grim, Tasmania), and the balloon-borne measurements of vertical profiles in the stratosphere from Hyderabad (India), Sanriku (Japan) and GAP (France) on event basis.
