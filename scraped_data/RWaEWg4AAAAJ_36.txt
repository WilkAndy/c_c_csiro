The experiment was conceived to investigate the microphysical properties of clouds in the unpolluted background region over the Southern Ocean. The case\u2010studies show evidence of decoupled stratocumulus layers, i.e. situations where cumulus clouds were covered by a uniform sheet of stratocumulus cloud. Optical depths of the clouds ranged from 2 to 23. Cloud droplet concentrations varied from 50 to 180cm\u22123, and mostly decreased with altitude, indicating the importance of droplet coalescence in reducing the number of large cloud droplets. Drizzle was observed on four of the six flights.A comparison of the summer results with those published from the winter phase of SOCEX indicates that the droplet concentration in summer was three times that of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17790061240643648259", "cites_id": ["17790061240643648259"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49712454507", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A3sCTXH-4vYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 5, "1999": 1, "2000": 8, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 6, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 9, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
