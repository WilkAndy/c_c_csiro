We use these data, with a simple model of atmospheric chemistry and transport, to optimally estimate the required change in emissions under both inter-annually repeating and inter-annually varying hydroxyl radical concentration. We find that if the annual mean hydroxyl radical concentration did not change, a substantial increase in emissions was required in both hemispheres during 2006-2007. However, if a small drop in the hydroxyl radical concentration did occur, consistent with AGAGE methyl chloroform measurements, the emissions increase is reduced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:GFxP56DSvIMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.B33B0402R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
