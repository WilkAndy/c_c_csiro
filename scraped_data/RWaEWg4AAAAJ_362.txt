The new CF4 calibration scale developed at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography shows that the atmospheric abundance is~ 7% lower than previously published. CF4 is the most abundant perfluorinated compound in the atmosphere and is one of the longest-lived and most potent greenhouse gases regulated in the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The improved precision of the analytical method has enabled us to determine the atmospheric abundance of CF4 in each hemisphere over three decades, with clearly defined interhemispheric gradients, using measurements of the Cape Grim Air Archive for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.A51B0094M/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
