At the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) measurement stations at Trinidad Head (THD) on the Northern California coast (41 N, 124 W), Cape Grim (CGM) on the northwestern tip of Tasmania (41 S, 145 E), and Mace Head (MHD) on the western coast of Ireland (53 N, 10 W), Medusa GC/MS and GC/ECD/FID instrumentation measure a wide range of trace gases in ambient air at high temporal resolution and high precision. Here, the western US, northwestern European and southern Australian emissions of the greenhouse gas (GHG) HFC-134a are estimated using the HFC-134a measurements, an atmospheric dispersion model (NAME), and an inversion methodology.
