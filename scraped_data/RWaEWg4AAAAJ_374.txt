Measurements of CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), CFC-113 (CCl2FCClF2), chloroform (CHCl3), methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) have been made at Cape Grim during 1993-2002, using a composite instrument comprising a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph (HP5890 GC) with two electron capture detectors (ECDs), a Carle Series 100 GC with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Trace Analytical RGA2/RGD2 GC with a mercuric oxide reduction detector (MRD), as part of the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) program. Collectively this instrument is called AGAGE2."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/baseline_2001-2002.pdf#page=57", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hdbKgOiicdcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
