The trace gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2). Measurements of \u03b413C from CO2 are also included in this database. The nine stationary sites are, from north to south: Alert, Canada; Shetland Islands, Scotland; Estevan Point, Canada; Mauna Loa, Hawaii; Cape Ferguson, Australia; Cape Grim, Australia (Tasmania); Macquarie Island, Australia; Mawson, Antarctica; and the South Pole station, Antarctica.For access to the data files, click this link to the CDIAC data transition website: http://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/epubs/db/db1021/db1021.html"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1389381", "cites_per_year": {}}
