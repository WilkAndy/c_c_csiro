Flasks are filled with air at Alert and returned to the CSIRO GASLAB for analysis; typical sample storage times for flasks collected at Alert range from a few weeks to a few months. No significant effect on the stable carbon isotopic composition, \u03b413C, has been detected as a consequence of the sample storage time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1394321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GqDvflFxPIQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
