Attention has been given to mean monthly statistics of rainfall, evaporation, soil moisture, net radiation and air temperature, both from a modelling and observational viewpoint. Five regions in Africa, Amazonia, Australia, Eurasia and north America were selected for study, with additional sites chosen for validation of the mean monthly diurnal cycle in air temperature, net radiation, sensible heat flux and evaporation simulated in the GCM. Each of these sites had comprehensive hourly observations of these quantities. Overah, we believe significant improvements to model simulations have resulted from implementation of the surface scheme discussed by Kowalczyk et al.(1991)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8027623390829516751", "cites_id": ["8027623390829516751"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/kowalczyk_1994a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:z5cCGfHYZ28J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 10, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 6, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
