The listed data were obtained from flask air samples returned to the CSIRO GASLAB for analysis. Typical sample storage times ranged from days to weeks for some sites (e.g., Cape Grim) to as much as one year for Macquarie Island and the Antarctic sites. Experiments carried out to test for any change in sample H22 mixing ratio during storage have shown no consistent and systematic drift in these flask types over test periods of several months to years (Cooper et al., 1999). An annual cycle of H2 is evident, reflecting the seasonal nature of some of the major sources and sinks (Novelli et al., 1999)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1389371", "cites_per_year": {}}
