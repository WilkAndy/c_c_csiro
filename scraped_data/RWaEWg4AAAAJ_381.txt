We report two years of in situ observations of these species from the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gas Experiment) program at Cape Grim, Tasmania (41\" S, 1450 E). The average background levels of CH3CI, CHC13 and CH2CL2 during 1998-2000 were 551+ 8, 6.3+ 0.2 and 8.9 {0.2 ppt (dry air mole fractions expressed in parts per 1012) respectively, with a two-year average amplitude of the seasonal cycles in background air of 25, 1. 1 and 1. 5 ppt respectively. The CH3CI and CHCI3 records at Cape Grim show clear episodes of elevated mixing ratios up to 1300 ppt and 55 ppt respectively, which are highly correlated, suggesting common source (s). Trajectory analyses show that the sources of CH3CI and CHCI3 that are responsible for these elevated observations are located in coastalterrestrial and/or coastal-seawater regions in Tasmania and the south-eastetn Australian mainland. Elevated levels of CH2C12 (up to 70 ppt above background) are associated mainly with emissions from the Melbourne/Port Phillip region, a large urban/industrial complex (population 3.5 million) 300 km north of Cape Grim."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/sturrock_x2003a.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FiX5Z4_yNnoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
