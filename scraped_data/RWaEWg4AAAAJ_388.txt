Typical sample storage times range from days to weeks for some sites (eg, Cape Grim) to as much as one year for Macquarie Island and the Antarctic sites. Experiments carried out to test for any change in sample H 2 mixing ratio during storage have shown no consistent and systematic drift in these flask types over test periods of several months to years (Cooper et al., 1999)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/otheratg/csiro-h2/csiro-cgrimh2.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2vIpsDvOkXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
