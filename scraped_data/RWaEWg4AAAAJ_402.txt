Flasks are filled with air at Cape Grim and returned to the CSIRO GASLAB for analysis; typical sample storage times for flasks collected at Cape Grim range from a few weeks to a few months. No significant effect on the stable carbon isotopic composition, \u03b4 13 C, has been detected as a consequence of the sample storage time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/allison-csiro/allcsiro-cgrim.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4JaW3jsIWUUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
