Typical sample storage times range from days to weeks for some sites (eg Cape Grim) to as much as 1 year for Macquarie Island and the Antarctic sites. Experiments carried out to test for changes in sample CO mixing ratio during storage have shown significant drifts in some flask types over test periods of several months to years (Cooper et al., 1999). Corrections derived from the test results are applied to network data according to flask type.(Data from the\" S160\" flasks have been rejected due to large and variable drift.)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/otheratg/csiro-co/csiro-cgrimco.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s2P_i-EJHLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
