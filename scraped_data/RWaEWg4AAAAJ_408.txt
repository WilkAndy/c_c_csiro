Typical sample storage times range from days to weeks for some sites (eg, Cape Grim) to as much as one year for Macquarie Island and the Antarctic sites. Experiments carried out to test for any change in sample CH 4 mixing ratio during storage have shown no drift to within detection limits over test periods of several months to years (Cooper et al., 1999)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/atm_meth/csiro/csiro-mawsonch4.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kygj6bELuTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
