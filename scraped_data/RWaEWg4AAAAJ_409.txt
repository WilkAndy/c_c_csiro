We find that these 20 inferred emissions are highly correlated with the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 (HCFC-22, CHClF2) for feedstock (FS) uses, because almost all HCFC-22 FS is pyrolyzed to produce (poly) tetrafluoroethylene ((P) TFE, Teflon) and hexafluoropropylene (HFP), a process in which c-C4F8 is a known by-product, causing a significant fraction of global c-C4F8 emissions. We find a global emission factor of~ 0.003 kg c-C4F8 per kg of HCFC-22 FS pyrolyzed. Mitigation of these c-C4F8 emissions, eg, through process optimization, abatement, or different manufacturing processes, such as 25 electrochemical fluorination, could reduce the climate impact of this industry. While it has been shown that c-C4F8 emissions from developing countries dominate global emissions, more atmospheric measurements and/or detailed process statistics are needed to quantify country to facility level c-C4F8 emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10833583742861176604&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
