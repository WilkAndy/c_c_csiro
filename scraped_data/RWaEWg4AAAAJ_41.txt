Atmospheric verification of emissions is vital but present global inversion methods are inadequate for this purpose. We demonstrate a clear response in atmospheric CO2 coinciding with a sharp 2010 increase in Asian emissions but show persisting slowing mean CO2 growth from 2002/03. Growth and inter-hemispheric concentration difference during the onset and recovery of the Global Financial Crisis support a previous speculation that the reported 2000\u20132008 emissions surge is an artefact, most simply explained by a cumulative underestimation (\u223c 9\u2009Pg\u2009C) of 1994\u20132007 emissions; in this case, post-2000 emissions would track mid-range of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6465573401041883140", "cites_id": ["6465573401041883140"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1817", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BNBQjsBUulkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 7, "2014": 17, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 16, "2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
