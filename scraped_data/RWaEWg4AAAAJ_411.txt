Ancillary data reported for the point measurements was therefore compared to the global gridded datasets (see Methods). Mean annual temperature (R2= 0.96, slope= 0.98), precipitation (R2= 0.87, slope= 0.67) and pH (R2= 0.60, slope= 0.62) agreed well between the point and gridded datasets. Soil carbon showed moderate agreement (R2= 0.3, slope= 0.35), while soil N and C: N ratio showed no correlation between the point and gridded datasets. The relatively poor agreement for soil C and N can be attributed to the high spatial variability of these parameters; additionally, the gridded datasets refer to organic C and N while the point data does not always report whether organic or total C and N were measured. A complete ancillary dataset was compiled by gapfilling missing point values of MAP, MAT and pH with gridded dataset values. For C, N and C: N only gridded values were used, as point and gridded datasets were inconsistent and point values are likely less comparable between sites. Other relevant parameters, such as bulk density, which were not reported or very sparsely reported in the point measurements were taken from the gridded datasets.An overview of the relationships between ancillary data and \u03b4 15Nsoil was gained using single linear correlation analyses and a multivariate principal components analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). The strongest positive linear correlations were found between \u03b4 15Nsoil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/item/item_3396681_1/component/file_3396683/BGC4035s1.pdf?mode=download", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:abXZHk2qHHYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
