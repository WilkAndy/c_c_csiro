Among other things, the network\u2019s measurements have helped estimate the lifetimes of ozone-depleting and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; monitor and pinpoint sources of emissions of chemicals banned by international agreements such as the Montreal Protocol, which outlawed the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); determine concentrations of the atmosphere\u2019s major\" cleansing agent,\u201d the hydroxyl radical (OH); and provide data to inform international policy discussions concerning atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions.To celebrate these and other achievements aimed at improving our understanding of key global chemical and climatic phenomena, nearly 40 AGAGE scientists, collaborators and invited guests from research institutions around the world\u2014many representing dozens more researchers at their home institutions\u2014gathered at a 40 th anniversary conference on October 7-12 at the MIT Endicott House. Participants discussed the network\u2019s evolution, impacts and future.(See 40 th anniversary photo gallery and journal publication.)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cgcs.mit.edu/monitoring-atmosphere-changing-world", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QLv51P5avA0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
