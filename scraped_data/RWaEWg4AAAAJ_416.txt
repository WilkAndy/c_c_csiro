Measurements of atmospheric CO2 levels began in 1976 and have continued until the present day, giving an unprecedented view of the overall change in CO2 composition over the 30+ year time-frame. These started with the URAS-2T instrument until Jun 1990, continuing with the Siemens Ultramat 5E system until July 2004, followed by the LOFLO Mk2 instrument until the present day. All use NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) analysis techniques with LOFLO being CSIRO developed to make measurements consuming smaller volumes of calibration gas, requiring less operator intervention and having less bias than traditional NDIR measurement techniques. Logged data is available in a single ascii text file in hourly averaged periods containing CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17066978344580670818&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
