However, the indirect estimations and process-based numerical models produce conflicting results. Here we have used a well-validated chemistry-transport model to simulate methyl chloroform (CH 3 CCl 3) for the period of 1981-2018. From the model-observation mismatches we have computed the interannual variability and trends in OH using the measurements from Barbados and Cape Grim. We estimate that the global mean OH should be slightly lower than the control value, by-1.2\u00b13.8% for the period 1986-2016, with decadal means of-2.5\u00b13.9,-0.35\u00b12.2 and-1.6\u00b13.8% during the periods of 1990-1999, 2000-2009 and 2010-2016, respectively. Our results indicate that the occurrence of El Ni\u00f1o tends to decrease global mean OH concentration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14196930834734406089&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yVkiKWChBcUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
