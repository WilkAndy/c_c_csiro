Because CH4 has a relatively short lifetime due to chemical losses in the atmosphere, it is expected that reducing CH4 emissions would mitigate global warming in a relatively short timeframe. However, sources of atmospheric CH4 are associated with a wide variety of processes such as fossil fuel production and consumption, agriculture, natural wetlands, and biomass burning, and our understanding of the full CH4 budget is limited. To better understand CH4 sources, an inverse analysis is one prominent methodology that estimates spatiotemporal variations of CH4 sources consistent with their prior estimates and atmospheric observations within specified uncertainties. In this study, we performed a long-term inverse analysis of CH 4 fluxes with an inversion system named NICAM-TM 4D-Var (Niwa et al., 2017a, b).
