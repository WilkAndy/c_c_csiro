Inversions are independently computed from three different space-borne observing systems and one surface observing system under several hypotheses for prior-flux and observation errors. Posterior methane emissions are compared and evaluated against surface mole fraction observations via a chemistry-transport model. Apart from SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY), the simulations agree fairly well with the surface mole fractions. The most consistent configurations of this study using TANSO-FTS (Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observation \u2013 Fourier Transform Spectrometer), IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) or surface measurements induce posterior methane global emissions of, respectively, 565 \u00b1 21 Tg yr\u22121, 549 \u00b1 36 Tg yr\u22121 and 538 \u00b1 15 Tg yr\u22121 over the one-year period August 2009\u2013July 2010. This consistency between the satellite retrievals (apart from SCIAMACHY) and independent surface measurements is promising for future improvement of CH4 emission estimates by atmospheric inversions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7433916694043294361", "cites_id": ["7433916694043294361"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/14/577/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mfpLvtiTKmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 14, "2016": 9, "2017": 14, "2018": 12, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
