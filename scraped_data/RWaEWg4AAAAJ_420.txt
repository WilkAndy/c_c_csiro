GASLAB principally analyzes air samples that have been captured at eleven fixed geographic sites and one moving (aircraft over bass strait and Cape Grim), but also includes other sites at various locations globally on a less regular or as needed basis. The flask air sample is analyzed for the 5 atmospheric trace gases Methane (CH4), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrogen (H2) and N2O (Nitrous Oxide). Data about the relative concentrations of these are particularly important for global warming studies as CO2 and CH4 are the two most effective anthropogenic greenhouse gases; CO and H2 influencing concentrations of the hydroxyl radical (OH), thereby affecting the main sink for atmospheric CH4.
