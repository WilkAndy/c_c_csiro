There are two major omissions, which should be addressed before publication in ACP. First, no reference is made to the inverse model study of Yoshida et al (2006). That work should be acknowledged, and it should be explained how the present study represents an advance in knowledge since the earlier work.We agree. We have added text and a reference to Yoshida et al.(2006) in the introduction section. In the paper the authors used a Bayesian least squares inverse method in a 3-D model to constrain hemispheric and seasonal biogenic and biomass burning sources. Although the available measurements covered several years, an \u201caverage year\u201d was generated for both the measurements and the derived sources. The estimated biogenic, biomass burning, and oceanic sources were 2500 (close to the Lee-Taylor et al.(2001) estimate), 545, and 761 (double the bottom-up estimate) Gg yr-1, respectively. However, potential month-to-month and interannual variability in these sources related to climatic changes was not resolved by this approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jgor-Arduini/publication/40780194_Optimal_estimation_of_the_surface_fluxes_of_methyl_chloride_using_a_3-D_global_chemical_transport_model/links/0912f50bc62b6be344000000/Optimal-estimation-of-the-surface-fluxes-of-methyl-chloride-using-a-3-D-global-chemical-transport-model.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
