However, we feel that the description of the LoFlo instrument along with the novel baseline assessment method and the method development work conducted to define the data uncertainty estimate are significant \u201ctechnique\u201d developments and of interest to the AMT readership. Although previous reports and manuals related to the LoFlo have been published, this is the only description available in peer-reviewed literature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11797862440478833490&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UvupwWFtuqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
