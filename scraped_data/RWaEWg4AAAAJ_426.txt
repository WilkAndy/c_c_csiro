LOFLO is an analysis system built around a commercial LI-COR 6251 optical bench which utilizes NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) gas analysis technology to measure CO2 concentrations in sample air. Consuming smaller volumes of calibration gases (approx. 15ml/min) and requiring much less operator intervention, LOFLO measurements have significantly less bias than traditional NDIR measurement techniques. Measurements using LOFLO first began at Cape Grim in May 2000 and has since been expanded to other global stations with the newer improved LOFLO Mk2. Stations using LOFLO include Cape Grim, Maquarie Island, Otways Basin and Aspendale. CO2 measurements are available from the Aspendale Air \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11623469378038295109&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
