Although recent work has succeeded in constraining global total OH abundance [Krol and Lelieveld, 2003] and its interannual variability [Montzka et al., 2011], the interhemispheric gradient remains unconstrained [Brenninkmeijer et al., 1992; Krol and Lelieveld, 2003]. The representation of the meridional OH gradient in chemistry-transport models (CTMs) has not been adequately addressed in most state-of-the-art CTMs, which has led to uncertain estimation of sources and sinks of chemically and radiatively active neutral species in the atmosphere. Because of the short lifetime of OH, direct observations are limited in space and time; thus, OH concentrations are inferred from species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10312331524062537713&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8WfPUeLCHI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
