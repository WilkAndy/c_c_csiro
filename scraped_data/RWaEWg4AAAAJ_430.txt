These experiments were conducted at both an urban site (Aspendale, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia), and the Cape Grim baseline site. Figure 1 shows the preliminary results from an overlap experiment involving two LoFlo analysers (identified here as LoFlo-2A, and LoFlo-2B, each one operating with its own suite of calibration gases) measuring marine boundary layer air from a shared single air intake at the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station, in northwest Tasmania, during April/May 2005. The figure shows the differences between hourly CO2 values from the two analysers, during those periods when baseline conditions were experienced. The seven high pressure, CO2-in-dry air calibration standards used for the LoFlo-2B system have been calibrated at the Carbon Cycle Gases Group (CCGG), United States National \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/vanderschootmv_x2005a.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
