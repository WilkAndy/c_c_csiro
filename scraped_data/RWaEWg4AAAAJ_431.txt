Comparison of these concentrations and trends for the four halocarbons with estimates of their industrial emission rates then enabled calculations of their global circulation rates and globally averaged atmospheric lifetimes. The ALE project was the precursor of the GAGE (Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) and thereafter AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) global observing system that has been continuously measuring the composition of the atmosphere since. This particular dataset represents measurements taken utilizing automated dual-column electron-capture gas chromatographs \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10120517120004705307&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
