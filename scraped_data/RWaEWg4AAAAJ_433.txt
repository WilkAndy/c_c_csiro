Prior to 1999 the globally averaged CH4 19 concentration was increasing at a rate of 6.0 ppb/yr, but during a stagnation period from 1999 20 to 2006 this growth rate slowed to 0.6 ppb/yr. Since 2007 the growth rate has again increased 21 to 4.9 ppb/yr. These changes in growth rate are usually ascribed to variations in CH4 emissions. 22 We have used a 3-D global chemical transport model, driven by meteorological reanalyses and 23 variations in global mean hydroxyl (OH) concentrations derived from CH3CCl3 observations 24 from two independent networks, to investigate these CH4 growth variations. The model shows 25 that between 1999 and 2006, changes in the CH4 atmospheric loss contributed significantly to 26 the suppression in global CH4 concentrations relative to the pre-1999 trend. The largest factor 27 in this is relatively small variations in global mean OH on a timescale of a few years, with 28 minor contributions of atmospheric transport of CH4 to its sink region and atmospheric 29 temperature. Although changes in emissions may be important during the stagnation period, 30 these results imply a smaller variation is required to explain the observed CH4 trends. The 31 contribution of OH variations to the renewed CH4 growth after 2007 cannot be determined with 32 data currently available. 33"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Garry-Hayman/publication/292188569_Role_of_OH_variability_in_the_stalling_of_the_global_atmospheric_CH4_growth_rate_from_1999_to_2006/links/5712247e08aeebe07c039c97/Role-of-OH-variability-in-the-stalling-of-the-global-atmospheric-CH4-growth-rate-from-1999-to-2006.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
