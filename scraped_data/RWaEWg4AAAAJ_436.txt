For the next week until the end of September the ozone levels varied between 110 DU and 120 DU, somewhat higher than in 2005 and 2006. This ozone hole may have reached its maximum depth, about the same as 2005 but not as deep as 2006 (Figure 1, top panel).By mid-September the ozone hole area reached 25 million km2 (Figure 1, bottom panel) which is similar to 2006 and 2005 at the same date. However there was a significant fall in area (back to 22 million km2) over the 3rd week of September, which recovered and then fell again during the 4th week of September.
