Global posterior estimates using GOSAT and/or surface measurements are between 510\u2013516 Tg yr\u22121, which is less than, though within the uncertainty of, the prior global flux of 529 \u00b1 25 Tg yr\u22121. We find larger differences between regional prior and posterior fluxes, with the largest changes in monthly emissions (75 Tg yr\u22121) occurring in Temperate Eurasia. In non-boreal regions the error reductions for inversions using the GOSAT data are at least three times larger (up to 45%) than if only surface data are assimilated, a reflection of the greater spatial coverage of GOSAT, with the two exceptions of latitudes >60\u00b0 associated with a data filter and over Europe where the surface network adequately describes fluxes on our model spatial and temporal grid. We use CarbonTracker and GEOS-Chem XCO2 model output to investigate model error on quantifying proxy GOSAT XCH4 (involving model XCO2) and inferring methane flux estimates from surface mole fraction data and show similar resulting fluxes, with differences reflecting initial differences in the proxy value. Using a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) we characterize the posterior flux \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=47042051333901822", "cites_id": ["47042051333901822"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/5697/2013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_k1DF38gpwAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 11, "2016": 20, "2017": 11, "2018": 12, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 7, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
