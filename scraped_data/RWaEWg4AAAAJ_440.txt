Comparison of these concentrations and trends for the five halocarbons with estimates of their industrial emission rates then enabled calculations of their global circulation rates and globally averaged atmospheric lifetimes. The GAGE project was the continuation and expansion of the ALE (Atmospheric Life Experiment) and precursor to the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) global observing system that has been continuously measuring the composition of the atmosphere since. This particular dataset represents measurements taken utilizing automated dual \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5418180447655426448&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
