The AGAGE project is part of the powerful global observing system that has been continuously measuring the composition of the atmosphere at high frequency from chosen coastal sites around the world, providing accurate measurements of trace gases whose lifetimes are long compared to global atmospheric circulation times. This particular dataset represents measurements taken utilizing GC-MD (Gas Chromatograph Multiple Detector) type of instrumentation which contains Electron Capture Detectors (ECD), Flame Ionization Detector (FID) & Mercuric oxide Reduction Detector (MRD). Utilising these it is possible to accurately measure the five biogenic/anthropogenic gases (CH4, N2O, CHCl3, CO & H2) and five anthropogenic gases (CCl3F, CCl2F2, CH3CCl3, CCl2FCClF2 & CCl4). This coupled with the GC-MS \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5004374894476381266&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
