Deschamps et al., 2004). Winter and spring temperatures in the Antarctic stratosphere from the global atmospheric weather forecast model GASP and those observed at Davis (68.6 \u00baS, 78.0 \u00baE) were higher than 2003. The warmer temperatures resulted in reduced coverage by polar stratospheric cloud (PSCs) that gave way to a smaller region of depleted ozone in 2004. In this Letter we present the meteorological conditions relevant to the ozone distribution during winter and the ultraviolet index (UV Index) during the Southern Hemisphere summer."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/42414676/Ozone_and_Ultraviolet_Radiation_Summer_220160208-14055-bj5xpq.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0rbp5NOkaz4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
