However, the indirect estimations and process-based numerical models produced conflicting results between and among them. Here we have used a well-validated chemistry-transport model to simulate methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) for the period of 1981-2018. From the model-observation mismatches of CH3CCl3 we have computed the interannual variability and trends in OH using the measurements from Barbados and Cape Grim. We estimate that the global mean OH should be slightly lower than the control value, by-1.2\u00b13.8% for the period 1986-2016, with decadal means of-2.5\u00b13.9,-0.35\u00b12.2 and-1.6\u00b13.8% during the periods of 1990-1999, 2000-2009 and 2010-2016, respectively.
