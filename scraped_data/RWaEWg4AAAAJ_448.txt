GASLAB principally analyzes air samples that have been captured at eleven fixed geographic sites and one moving (aircraft over bass strait and Cape Grim), but also includes other sites at various locations globally on a less regular or as needed basis. The CO2C13 measurements are made by concentrating the CO2 from the air sample utilising a 3 step automated cryogenic trapping system connected to a dual inlet stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT252) for analysis. The CO2 and N2O gas chromatography concentrations data for the sample are used for ion corrections on the stable isotope measurements. Alternatively the Cape Grim in situ air sample (cia) which has already had the trapping process \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4029196118041559060&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
