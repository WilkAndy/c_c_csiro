In addition, the paper documents the model's ability to simulate realistic surface fluxes by comparison with mesoscale model simulations (involving more sophisticated soil and boundary-layer treatments) and observations, and the diurnal range in surface quantities, including extreme maximum surface temperatures. The sensitivity of the model to values of the surface resistance is also quantified. The model represents phase 1 of a longer-term plan to improve the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and surface schemes in the CSIRO GCMs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10683022653640706794", "cites_id": ["10683022653640706794"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991scsn.rept.....K/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6oq0nYC4QZQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 8, "1996": 9, "1997": 9, "1998": 11, "1999": 7, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 9, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 0, "2008": 6, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
