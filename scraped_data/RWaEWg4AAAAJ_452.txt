The Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station facility, located at the North/West tip of Tasmania (40 41'S, 144 41'E), is funded and managed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, with the scientific program being jointly supervised with CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research. The role of the station has been to observe global air quality through the measurements of atmospheric pollution such as carbon dioxide, ozone, halocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, particulates, precipitation chemistry as well as to monitor other parameters such as solar radiation and meteorological variables. This archive contains hourly measurements of Atmospheric Wind speed and direction at 10 & 50m heights, temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, number of baseline minutes for the hour, CN counts and carbon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1727000454319653709&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
