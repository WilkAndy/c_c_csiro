The AGAGE project is part of the powerful global observing system that has been continuously measuring the composition of the atmosphere at high frequency from chosen coastal sites around the world, providing accurate measurements of trace gases whose lifetimes are long compared to global atmospheric circulation times. These particular datasets represent measurements taken with both the original ADS GC-MS system (University of Bristol developed adsorption-desorption preconcentration module) and the more recently (May 2003) developed Medusa (improved cryogenic preconcentration system, Scripps Institution of Oceanography) type of instrumentation. Utilising these it is possible to accurately measure 43 species of Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, methyl halides & halon gases at a 2 hourly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=301387608738048535&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
