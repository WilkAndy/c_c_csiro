The microphysical and radiative characteristics of marine stratocumulus cloud sheets were sampled on four days, three of which are considered baseline days when air parcels had traversed long distances over the ocean without having been exposed to anthropogenic sources of pollution. Clouds were depleted by drizzle, with cloud liquid\u2010water often smaller than 50% of the expected adiabatic value. Horizontal variability in liquid\u2010water content associated with non\u2010drizzle droplets was primarily caused by variations in the droplet number concentration, which was found to be among the lowest ever recorded (10 to 40 cm \u22123 for clouds of up to 300 m deep). Cloud albedos integrated over the solar spectrum varied from 40 to 60%, which roughly agreed with radiative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 94, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8605765499191565880", "cites_id": ["8605765499191565880"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49712253405", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OB6gTyDSbXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 11, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 6, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3}}
