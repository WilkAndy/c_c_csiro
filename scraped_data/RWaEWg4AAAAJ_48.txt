At a second AGAGE station at Cape Grim, Tasmania, CH2Cl2 and C2Cl4 data collection commenced in 1998 and 2000, respectively. C2HCl3 is below the limit of detection at Cape Grim except during pollution episodes. At Mace Head CH2Cl2 shows a downward trend from 1995 to 2004 of 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 ppt yr\u22121 (ppt: expressed as dry mole fractions in 1012), although from 1998 to 2004 the decrease has been only 0.3 \u00b1 0.1ppt yr\u22121. Conversely, there has been a small but significant growth of 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 ppt yr\u22121 in CH2Cl2 at Cape Grim. The time series for C2HCl3 and C2Cl4 are relatively short for accurate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:yqoGN6RLRZoC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14730919807781565908", "cites_id": ["14730919807781565908"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JD007082", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1PWVdYS9bswJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 10, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 7, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 3, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
