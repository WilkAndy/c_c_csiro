Remarkably, a similar growth rate is found at all monitoring locations from this time until the latest measurements. We use these data, along with an inverse method applied to a simple model of atmospheric chemistry and transport, to investigate the possible drivers of the rise. Specifically, the relative roles of an increase in emission rate or a decrease in concentration of the hydroxyl radical, the largest methane sink, are examined. We conclude that: 1) if the annual mean hydroxyl radical concentration did not change, a substantial increase in emissions was required \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 598, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8484544204926166786", "cites_id": ["8484544204926166786"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2008GL036037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Aie5VwAov3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 31, "2010": 54, "2011": 67, "2012": 55, "2013": 61, "2014": 44, "2015": 43, "2016": 49, "2017": 41, "2018": 32, "2019": 24, "2020": 31, "2021": 30, "2022": 18, "2023": 7}}
