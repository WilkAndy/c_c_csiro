We report two years of in situ observations of these species from the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gas Experiment) program at Cape Grim, Tasmania (41\u00b0 S, 145\u00b0 E). The average background levels of CH3Cl, CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 during 1998\u20132000 were 551\u00b1 8, 6.3\u00b1 0.2 and 8.9\u00b1 0.2 ppt (dry air mole fractions expressed in parts per 1012) respectively, with a two-year average amplitude of the seasonal cycles in background air of 25, 1.1 and 1.5 ppt respectively. The CH3Cl and CHCl3 records at Cape Grim show clear episodes of elevated mixing ratios up to 1300 ppt and 55 ppt respectively, which are highly correlated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=386211406068739055", "cites_id": ["386211406068739055"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024022320985", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:72vuQjoZXAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 7, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
