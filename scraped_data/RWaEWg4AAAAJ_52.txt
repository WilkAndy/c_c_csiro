At Mace Head both gases have well-defined seasonal cycles with similar average annual decreases of 3.0% yr-1(CH3 Br) and 2.6% yr-1(CH3 Cl), and mean northern hemisphere baseline mole fractions of 10.37\u00b10.05 ppt and 535.7\u00b12.2 ppt, respectively. We have used a Lagrangian dispersion model and local meteorological data to segregate the Mace Head observations into different source regions, and interpret the results in terms of the known sources and sinks of these two key halocarbons. At Cape Grim CH3 Br and CH3 Cl also show annual decreases in their baseline mixing ratios of 2.5% yr-1 and 1.5% yr-1, respectively. Mean baseline mole fractions were 7.94\u00b10.03 ppt (CH3 Br) and 541.3\u00b11.1 ppt (CH3 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1804761118556109835", "cites_id": ["1804761118556109835"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=01677764&AN=15100263&h=8ixKYxgThMaNogJDeKhjwBbDPjLk8AwhbQiNWqiEknJ7heSov4hnJXdiKjg0Cs14efulKurQRwYeb900z3bGAw%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Czz536zMCxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 9, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 6, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
