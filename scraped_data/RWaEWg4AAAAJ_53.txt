We find that the total CO2-equivalent emissions of the five HFCs from countries that are required to provide detailed, annual reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) increased from 198 (175\u2013221) Tg-CO2-eq\u22c5y\u20131 in 2007 to 275 (246\u2013304) Tg-CO2-eq\u22c5y\u20131 in 2012. These global warming potential-weighted aggregated emissions agree well with those reported to the UNFCCC throughout this period and indicate that the gap between reported emissions and global HFC emissions derived from atmospheric trends is almost entirely due to emissions from nonreporting countries. However, our measurement-based \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 74, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10494322015712490685", "cites_id": ["10494322015712490685"], "pub_url": "https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1420247112", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vbQaoUVSo5EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 11, "2017": 10, "2018": 12, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 14, "2022": 8, "2023": 5}}
