Emphasis is placed on net radiation and evaporation for (i) five continental regions (each approximately 20\u00b0\u00d7150\u00b0) within Africa, Australia, Eurasia, South America, and the United States; (ii) a number of continental sites in both hemispheres. Both the mean monthly values of the local and regional fluxes and the mean monthly diurnal cycles of the local fluxes are described. Mostly, GCMs tend to overestimate the mean monthly levels of net radiation by about 15% \u201320%  on an annual basis, for observed annual values in the range 50 to 100 Wm             \u22122             . This is probably the result of several deficiencies, including (i) continental surface albedos being undervalued in a number of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9666570964580793430", "cites_id": ["9666570964580793430"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/6/6/1520-0442_1993_006_1090_tsebal_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VnzxmxOPJoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 4, "1995": 10, "1996": 9, "1997": 4, "1998": 6, "1999": 6, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1}}
