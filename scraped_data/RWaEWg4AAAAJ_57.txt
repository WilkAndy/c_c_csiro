The observations show clear signatures of Northern and Southern Hemispheric (NH and SH) air masses, mixed with their regional fluxes and chemical loss mechanisms, resulting in complex seasonal variation of these gases. The CRI measurements are compared with remote marine sites at Seychelles and Mauna Loa. Simulations of two major anthropogenic greenhouse gases (CO\u2082 and CH\u2084) concentrations using a chemistry-transport model for the CRI site suggest that globally optimized fluxes can produce results comparable to the observations. We discuss that CRI observations have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6335103774100404573", "cites_id": ["6335103774100404573"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24109728", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xbl9VlHP6lcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 5, "2018": 8, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
