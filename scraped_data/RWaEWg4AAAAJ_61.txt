Observations of HFC\u2010152a at five locations (four European and one Australian) over a 10 year period were recorded. The annual average growth rate of HFC\u2010152a in the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere has risen from 0.11 ppt/yr to 0.6 ppt/yr from 1994 to 2004. The Southern Hemisphere annual average growth rate has risen from 0.09 ppt/yr to 0.4 ppt/yr from 1998 to 2004. The 2004 average mixing ratio for HFC\u2010152a was 5.0 ppt and 1.8 ppt in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively. The annual cycle observed for this species in both hemispheres is approximately consistent with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17948720152046944242", "cites_id": ["17948720152046944242"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JD007527", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8j-nw-GpFvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 6, "2009": 4, "2010": 5, "2011": 11, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
