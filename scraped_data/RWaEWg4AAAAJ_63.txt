The five frameworks differ in the choice of CTM, meteorological data, prior uncertainties and inversion method but use the same prior emissions and observation data set. The posterior modelled atmospheric N2O mole fractions are compared to observations to assess the performance of the inversions and to help diagnose problems in the modelled transport. Additionally, the mean emissions for 2006 to 2008 are compared in terms of the spatial distribution and seasonality. Overall, there is a good agreement among the inversions for the mean global total emission, which ranges from 16.1 to 18.7 TgN yr\u22121 and is consistent with previous estimates. Ocean emissions represent between 31 and 38% of the global total compared to widely varying previous estimates of 24 to 38%. Emissions from the northern mid- to high latitudes are likely to be more important, with a consistent shift in emissions from the tropics and subtropics to the mid- to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere; the emission ratio for 0\u201330\u00b0 N to 30\u201390\u00b0 N ranges from 1.5 to 1.9 compared with 2.9 to 3.0 in previous estimates. The largest discrepancies across inversions are seen for the regions of South and East Asia and for tropical and South America owing to the poor observational constraint for these areas and to considerable differences in the modelled transport, especially inter-hemispheric exchange rates and tropical convective mixing. Estimates of the seasonal cycle in N2O emissions are also sensitive to errors in modelled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4997881947186293842", "cites_id": ["4997881947186293842"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/14/6177/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UmxgqyYLXEUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 13, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 8, "2022": 8}}
