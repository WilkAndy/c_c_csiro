The clouds were observed using a research aircraft west of Tasmania during the Southern Ocean Cloud Experiment. A clean marine boundary layer contained both cumulus clouds (some oriented in bands) and an upper level stratus deck organised in a closed cell circulation. \u201cCold pools,\u201d that is regions of evaporatively cooled air under mature cumulus clouds, were observed on several occasions. Air in the cold pool centre showed a divergent component of the wind perpendicular to the mature cumulus bands. Ahead of this spreading precipitation downdraft, the wind component perpendicular to the cumulus band was convergent, and new cumulus clouds were subsequently formed over these regions. This dynamical situation is likened to an actively developing squall line of the propagating type.
