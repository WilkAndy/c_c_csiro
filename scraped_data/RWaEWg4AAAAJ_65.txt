India has the world\u2019s largest ruminant population and produces ~\u200920% of the world\u2019s rice. Therefore, changes in these sources could have significant implications for global warming. Here, we infer India\u2019s CH4 emissions for the period 2010\u20132015 using a combination of satellite, surface and aircraft data. We apply a high-resolution atmospheric transport model to simulate data from these platforms to infer fluxes at sub-national scales and to quantify changes in rice emissions. We find that average emissions over this period are 22.0 (19.6\u201324.3) Tg\u2009yr\u22121, which is consistent with the emissions reported by India to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change. Annual emissions have not changed significantly (0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121) between 2010 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17973924610254965889", "cites_id": ["17973924610254965889"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00994-7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gQzm_TM1cPkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 13, "2020": 11, "2021": 15, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
