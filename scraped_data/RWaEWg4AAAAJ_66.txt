The magnitudes and seasonal cycles of the major (presumably microbial) soil sink of hydrogen have been estimated from high\u2010frequency in situ AGAGE H2 observations and also from more geographically extensive but low\u2010frequency flask measurements from CSIRO and NOAA\u2010GMD using the Kalman filter in a two\u2010dimensional (2\u2010D) global transport model. Hydrogen mole fractions exhibit well\u2010defined seasonal cycles in each hemisphere with their phase difference being only about 3 months. The global production rate of H2 is estimated to be 103 \u00b1 10 Tg yr\u22121 with only a small estimated interannual variation. Soil uptake (84 \u00b1 8 Tg yr\u22121) represents the major loss process for H2 and accounts for 81% of the total destruction. Strong seasonal cycles are deduced for the soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17505014929962162539", "cites_id": ["17505014929962162539"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006JD007241", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a9lNUFVO7vIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 15, "2012": 7, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
