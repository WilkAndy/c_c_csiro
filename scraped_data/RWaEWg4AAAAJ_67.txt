The ten trace gases measured as part of the AGAGE program at the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station in Tasmania are: CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), CFC-113 (CCl2FCClF2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), chloroform (CHCl3), methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The process of estimating emissions involved first identifying pollution episodes in the Cape Grim record that were attributed to air masses that passed over the Melbourne region before travelling across Bass Strait to Cape Grim. Correlations between the trace species and an estimate of CO emissions from Melbourne were used to deduce the mass of the Melbourne emissions.
