Since 2013, the concentration decline of CFC-11 slowed unexpectedly owing to increasing emissions, probably from unreported production, which, if sustained, would delay the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer\u2013. Here we report an accelerated decline in the global mean CFC-11 concentration during 2019 and 2020, derived from atmospheric concentration measurements at remote sites around the world. We find that global CFC-11 emissions decreased by 18 \u00b1 6 gigagrams per year (26 \u00b1 9 per cent; one standard deviation) from 2018 to 2019, to a 2019 value (52 \u00b1 10 gigagrams per year) that is similar to the 2008\u22122012 mean. The decline in global emissions suggests a substantial decrease in unreported CFC-11 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:PYBJJbyH-FwC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11257082221461794678", "cites_id": ["11257082221461794678"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03260-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dm-YSaMwOZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 22, "2022": 21, "2023": 11}}
