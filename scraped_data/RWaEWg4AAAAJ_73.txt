From this, we find an increase of atmospheric methane total columns of 0.31\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03\u202f%\u202fyear\u22121 (2\u03c3 level of uncertainty) for the 2005\u20132014 period. Comparisons with in situ methane measurements at both local and global scales show good agreement. We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model tagged simulation, which accounts for the contribution of each emission source and one sink in the total methane, simulated over 2005\u20132012. After regridding according to NDACC vertical layering using a conservative regridding scheme and smoothing by convolving with respective FTIR seasonal averaging kernels, the GEOS-Chem simulation shows an increase of atmospheric methane total columns of 0.35\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03\u202f%\u202fyear\u22121 between 2005 and 2012, which is in agreement with NDACC measurements over the same time period (0.30\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202f%\u202fyear\u22121, averaged over 10 stations). Analysis of the GEOS-Chem-tagged simulation allows us to quantify the contribution of each tracer to the global methane change since 2005. We find that natural sources such as wetlands and biomass burning contribute to the interannual variability of methane. However, anthropogenic emissions, such as coal mining, and gas and oil transport and exploration, which are mainly emitted in the Northern Hemisphere and act as secondary contributors to the global budget of methane, have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2373809559216875904", "cites_id": ["2373809559216875904"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/2255/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gGmMlTd38SAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 15, "2022": 10, "2023": 3}}
