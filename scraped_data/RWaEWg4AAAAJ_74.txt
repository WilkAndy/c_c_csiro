The location offers a valuable opportunity to study drivers of atmospheric composition in the Southern Hemisphere. Here, a record of surface carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured with an in situ Fourier transform infrared trace gas analyser between April 2011 and August 2014. Clean air was found to arrive at Wollongong in approximately 10% of air masses. Biomass burning influence was evident in the average annual cycle of clean air CO during austral spring. A significant negative short-term trend was found in clean air CO (\u22121.5 nmol mol\u22121 a\u22121), driven by a reduction in northern Australian biomass burning. Significant short-term positive trends in clean air CH4 (5.4 nmol mol\u22121 a\u22121) and CO2 (1.9 \u03bcmol mol\u22121 a\u22121) were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2992308972505428085", "cites_id": ["2992308972505428085"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231015305483", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dXBmFCjRhikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 4, "2017": 8, "2018": 9, "2019": 8, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
