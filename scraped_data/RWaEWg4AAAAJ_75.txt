Global mean mole fractions of HCFC-22, -141b, and -142b have increased throughout the observation period, reaching 234, 24.3 and 22.4\u202fpmol\u202fmol\u22121, respectively, in 2015. HCFC-124 reached a maximum global mean mole fraction of 1.48\u202fpmol\u202fmol\u22121 in 2007 and has since declined by 23\u202f% to 1.14\u202fpmol\u202fmol\u22121 in 2015. The HFCs all show increasing global mean mole fractions. In 2015 the global mean mole fractions (pmol\u202fmol\u22121) were 83.3 (HFC-134a), 18.4 (HFC-125), 17.7 (HFC-143a) and 10.5 (HFC-32). The 2007 adjustment to the Montreal Protocol required the accelerated phase-out of emissive uses of HCFCs with global production and consumption capped in 2013 to mitigate their environmental impact as both ozone-depleting substances and important greenhouse gases. We find that this change has coincided with a stabilisation, or moderate reduction, in global emissions of the four HCFCs with aggregated global emissions in 2015 of 449\u202f\u00b1\u202f75\u202fGg\u202fyr\u22121, in CO2 equivalent units (CO2\u202feq.) 0.76\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fGt\u202fyr\u22121, compared with 483\u202f\u00b1\u202f70\u202fGg\u202fyr\u22121 (0.82\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fGt\u202fyr\u22121\u202fCO2\u202feq.) in 2010 (uncertainties are 1\u03c3 throughout this paper). About 79\u202f% of the total HCFC atmospheric burden in 2015 is HCFC \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3506237254020873456", "cites_id": ["3506237254020873456"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/4641/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8LwnqDSoqDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 11, "2019": 14, "2020": 3, "2021": 12, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
