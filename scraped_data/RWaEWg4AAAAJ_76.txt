HFC\u2010125 is the fifth most abundant HFC, and it currently makes the third largest contribution of the HFCs to atmospheric radiative forcing. At the beginning of 2008 the global average was 5.6 ppt in the lower troposphere and the growth rate was 16% yr\u22121. The extensive observations have been combined with a range of modeling techniques to derive global emission estimates in a top\u2010down approach. It is estimated that 21 kt were emitted globally in 2007, and the emissions are estimated to have increased 15% yr\u22121 since 2000.
