Under the terms of the Montreal Protocol, its production for dispersive uses was banned from 2010. In this work we show that, despite the controls on production being introduced, CCl4 emissions from the eastern part of China did not decline between 2009 and 2016. This finding is in contrast to a recent bottom\u2010up estimate, which predicted a significant decrease in emissions after the introduction of production controls. We find eastern Asian emissions of CCl4 to be 16 (9\u201324) Gg/year on average between 2009 and 2016, with the primary source regions being in eastern China. The spatial distribution of emissions that we derive suggests that the source distribution of CCl4 in China changed during the 8\u2010year study period, indicating a new source or sources of emissions from China's Shandong \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8163774936233921560", "cites_id": ["8163774936233921560"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL079500", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GMx1DA2OS3EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 16, "2020": 13, "2021": 13, "2022": 3, "2023": 4}}
