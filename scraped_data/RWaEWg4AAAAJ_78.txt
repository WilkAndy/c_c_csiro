Here we report the first in situ global measurements of these two gases. HFC-143a and HFC-32 are the third and sixth most abundant hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) respectively and they currently make an appreciable contribution to the HFCs in terms of atmospheric radiative forcing (1.7 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.02 mW m\u22122 in 2012 respectively). In 2012 the global average mole fraction of HFC-143a was 13.4 \u00b1 0.3 ppt (1\u03c3) in the lower troposphere and its growth rate was 1.4 \u00b1 0.04 ppt yr\u22121; HFC-32 had a global mean mole fraction of 6.2 \u00b1 0.2 ppt and a growth rate of 1.1 \u00b1 0.04 ppt yr\u22121 in 2012. The extensive observations presented in this work have been combined with an atmospheric transport model to simulate global atmospheric abundances and derive global emission estimates. It is estimated that 23 \u00b1 3 Gg yr\u22121 of HFC-143a and 21 \u00b1 11 Gg yr\u22121 of HFC-32 were emitted globally in 2012, and the emission rates are estimated to be increasing by 7 \u00b1 5% yr\u22121 for HFC-143a and 14 \u00b1 11% yr\u22121 for HFC-32."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3193610978305579657", "cites_id": ["3193610978305579657"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/14/9249/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iRqxqEP8USwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 11, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
