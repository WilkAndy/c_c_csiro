The scheme was included in a global atmospheric model and used to quantify the stratospheric injection of chlorine from anthropogenic VSLS ( ) between 2005 and 2013. By constraining the model with surface measurements of chloroform (CHCl3), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), tetrachloroethene (C2Cl4), trichloroethene (C2HCl3), and 1,2\u2010dichloroethane (CH2ClCH2Cl), we infer a 2013  mixing ratio of 123 parts per trillion (ppt). Stratospheric injection of source gases dominates this supply, accounting for \u223c83% of the total. The remainder comes from VSLS\u2010derived organic products, phosgene (COCl2, 7%) and formyl chloride (CHClO, 2%), and also hydrogen chloride (HCl, 8%).
