We validate the newly developed ACTM simulations of N2O for loss rate and transport in the stratosphere using satellite observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura\u2010MLS), with optimized surface fluxes for reproducing N2O trends observed at the surface stations. Observations in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UT/LS) obtained by the Japan AirLines commercial flights commuting between Narita (36\u00b0N), Japan, and Sydney (34\u00b0S), Australia, have been used to study the role of stratosphere\u2010troposphere exchange (STE) on N2O variability near the tropopause. Low N2O concentration events in the UT region are shown to be captured statistically \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15901709499864787481", "cites_id": ["15901709499864787481"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009JD013322", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GSrlDIo4rtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2}}
