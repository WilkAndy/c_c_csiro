Our primary motivation was to enhance the scientific community\u2019s ability to understand and quantify the potential effects of pollution, nutrient or pollen transport from distant land masses to these remote, sparsely instrumented regions. Seasonal radon characteristics are discussed at 6 stations (Macquarie Island, King Sejong, Neumayer, Dumont d\u2019Urville, Jang Bogo and Dome Concordia) using 1\u20134 years of continuous observations. Context is provided for differences observed between these sites by Southern Ocean radon transects between 45 and 67\u00b0S made by the Research Vessel Investigator. Synoptic transport of continental air within the marine boundary layer (MBL) dominated radon seasonal cycles in the mid-Southern Ocean site (Macquarie Island). MBL synoptic transport, tropospheric injection, and Antarctic outflow all contributed to the seasonal cycle at the sub-Antarctic site (King Sejong). Tropospheric subsidence and injection events delivered terrestrially influenced air to the Southern Ocean MBL in the vicinity of the circumpolar trough (or \u201cPolar Front\u201d). Katabatic outflow events from Antarctica were observed to modify trace gas and aerosol characteristics of the MBL 100\u2013200 km off the coast. Radon seasonal cycles at coastal Antarctic sites were dominated by a combination of local radon sources in summer and subsidence of terrestrially influenced tropospheric air, whereas those on the Antarctic Plateau were primarily controlled by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3000076064513774974", "cites_id": ["3000076064513774974"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00190/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ftV-HElpoikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 8, "2021": 13, "2022": 10, "2023": 13}}
