In recent years, an unexpected increase in CFC-11 emissions beginning in 2013 has been reported, with much of the global rise attributed to emissions from eastern China,. Here we use high-frequency atmospheric mole fraction observations from Gosan, South Korea and Hateruma, Japan, together with atmospheric chemical transport-model simulations, to investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern China. We find that CFC-11 emissions returned to pre-2013 levels in 2019 (5.0 \u00b1 1.0 gigagrams per year in 2019, compared to 7.2 \u00b1 1.5 gigagrams per year for 2008\u20132012, \u00b11 standard deviation), decreasing by 10 \u00b1 3 gigagrams per year since 2014\u20132017. Furthermore, we find that in this region, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17630175569728180114", "cites_id": ["17630175569728180114"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03277-w", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kg9roUX3qvQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 14, "2022": 19, "2023": 9}}
