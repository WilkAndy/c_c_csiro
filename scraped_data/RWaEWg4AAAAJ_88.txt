Six different models and two model variants participated in the inter-comparison and simulations were made for the period 2006 to 2009. In addition to N2O, simulations of CFC-12 and SF6 were made by a subset of four of the models to provide information on the models' proficiency in stratosphere\u2013troposphere exchange (STE) and meridional transport, respectively. The same prior emissions were used by all models to restrict differences among models to transport and chemistry alone. Four different N2O flux scenarios totalling between 14 and 17 TgN yr\u22121 (for 2005) globally were also compared. The modelled N2O mixing ratios were assessed against observations from in situ stations, discrete air sampling networks and aircraft. All models adequately captured the large-scale patterns of N2O and the vertical gradient from the troposphere to the stratosphere and most models also adequately captured the N2O tropospheric growth rate. However, all models underestimated the inter-hemispheric N2O gradient by at least 0.33 parts per billion (ppb), equivalent to 1.5 TgN, which, even after accounting for an overestimate of emissions in the Southern Ocean of circa 1.0 TgN, points to a likely underestimate of the Northern Hemisphere source by up to 0.5 TgN and/or an overestimate of STE in the Northern Hemisphere. Comparison with aircraft data reveal that the models overestimate the amplitude of the N2O seasonal cycle at Hawaii (21\u00b0 N, 158\u00b0 W \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7423748402855537399", "cites_id": ["7423748402855537399"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/14/4349/2014/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9-oT9tZzBmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 8, "2016": 2, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 6, "2022": 5}}
