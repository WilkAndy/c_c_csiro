Previously we reported a global emission rate of 7.3\u00b10.6\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2008 and over the past decade emissions have continued to increase by about 24\u2009% to 9.04\u00b10.35\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2018. We show that changing patterns in SF6 consumption from developed (Kyoto Protocol Annex-1) to developing countries (non-Annex-1) and the rapid global expansion of the electric power industry, mainly in Asia, have increased the demand for SF6-insulated switchgear, circuit breakers, and transformers. The large bank of SF6 sequestered in this electrical equipment provides a substantial source of emissions from maintenance, replacement, and continuous leakage. Other emissive sources of SF6 occur from the magnesium, aluminium, and electronics industries as well as more minor industrial applications. More recently, reported emissions, including those from electrical equipment and metal industries, primarily in the Annex-1 countries, have declined steadily through substitution of alternative blanketing gases and technological improvements in less emissive equipment and more efficient industrial practices. Nevertheless, there are still demands for SF6 in Annex-1 countries due to economic growth, as well as continuing emissions from older equipment and additional emissions from newly installed SF6-insulated electrical equipment, although at low emission rates. In addition, in the non-Annex-1 countries, SF6 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15009492984586602134", "cites_id": ["15009492984586602134"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/20/7271/2020/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:loYAhVhuTNAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 12, "2022": 12, "2023": 14}}
