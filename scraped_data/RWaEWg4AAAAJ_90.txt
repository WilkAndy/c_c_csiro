Long-term, quasi-continuous observations can provide valuable information about their regional sources, which may be significant in the global context. We report 3 years of in situobservations of these trace gases from the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gas Experiment) program at Cape Grim, Tasmania (41 \u00b0S, 145 \u00b0E). The average background levels of CH3Br and CH3I during March 1998\u2013March 2001 were 8.05 and 1.39 ppt (dry air mole fractions expressed in parts per 1012), respectively. The CH3Br background data showed little seasonal variability. Trajectory analyses reveal that air masses showing elevated CH3Br levels at Cape Grim have had significant contact with coastal-terrestrial and/or coastal-seawater and/or urban \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3891555907771686638", "cites_id": ["3891555907771686638"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10874-005-2434-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7t5N0nqVATYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 14, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 4}}
