The data cover the period from January 2005 to April 2012 and the altitude range from the upper troposphere (above cloud top altitude) to about 50 km. The profile retrieval was performed by constrained nonlinear least squares fitting of modelled spectra to the measured limb spectral radiances. The spectral \u03bd4-band at 816.5 \u00b1 13 cm\u22121 was used for the retrieval. A Tikhonov-type smoothing constraint was applied to stabilise the retrieval. In the lower stratosphere, we find a global volume mixing ratio of HCFC-22 of about 185 pptv in January 2005. The rate of linear growth in the lower latitudes lower stratosphere was about 6 to 7\u202fpptv\u202fyear\u22121 in the period 2005\u20132012. The profiles obtained were compared with ACE-FTS satellite data v3.5, as well as with MkIV balloon profiles and cryosampler balloon measurements. Between 13 and 22 km, average agreement within \u22123 to +5 pptv (MIPAS \u2013 ACE) with ACE-FTS v3.5 profiles is demonstrated. Agreement with MkIV solar occultation balloon-borne measurements is within 10\u201320 pptv below 30 km and worse above, while in situ cryosampler balloon measurements are systematically lower over their full altitude range by 15\u201350 pptv below 24 km and less than 10 pptv above 28 km. MIPAS HCFC-22 time series below 10 km altitude are shown to agree mostly well to corresponding time series of near-surface abundances from the NOAA/ESRL and AGAGE networks, although a more pronounced seasonal cycle is obvious in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11703540861296899729", "cites_id": ["11703540861296899729"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/16/3345/2016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kfbew2dUa6IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 5, "2019": 8, "2020": 2, "2021": 7, "2022": 4}}
