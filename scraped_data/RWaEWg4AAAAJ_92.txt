However, there has been little monitoring of atmospheric CO2 concentration over India to date. Here we reanalyse pioneering atmospheric CO2 observations at Cape Rama, India (CRI) during the period from February 1993 to October 2002, using three forward transport models to simulate atmospheric CO2 and separate tracers of terrestrial and oceanic fluxes, and fossil-fuel emissions. The CO2 seasonal behaviour at this site has clear signals from monsoon-driven meteorology and terrestrial ecosystem activity, which are generally captured by all three models. The quality of the agreement between the simulations and the observations varies with season, with better results obtained during the southwest monsoon months when the CRI site observes the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2217315839086822670", "cites_id": ["2217315839086822670"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/24080696", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DgWe_wF9xR4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
