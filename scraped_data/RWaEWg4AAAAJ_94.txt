ATMOSPHERIC METHANE, CARBON DIOXIDE, HYDROGEN, CARBON MONOXIDE AND NITROUS OXIDE FROM CAPE GRIM FLASK AIR SAMPLES ANALYSED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY", "pub_year": 2004, "citation": "Baseline 8 (4), 46, 2004", "author": "RL Langenfelds and LP Steele and MV Van der Schoot and LN Cooper and DA Spencer and PB Krummel", "journal": "Baseline", "volume": "8", "number": "4", "pages": "46", "abstract": "Air samples are regularly collected at Cape Grim in glass and stainless steel flasks, and returned to CSIRO Atmospheric Research\u2019s (CAR) Global Atmospheric Sampling Laboratory (GASLAB) for analysis of trace gas composition [Francey et al., 1996; 2003a; 2003b]. Gas chromatographic (GC) measurements of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) commenced in 1980 [Fraser and Hyson, 1986; Fraser et al., 1986; 1994]. Introduction of new and upgraded instrumentation in 1991/92 as part of the GASLAB development led to improved precision and calibration of previously measured species, and measurement of two additional species, hydrogen (H2) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Figure 1 shows time series and growth rates for CH4 and CO through 2002. Figure 2 shows CO2, H2 and N2O. Data are displayed for all flask samples with different symbols used to distinguish retained and rejected data. Causes of rejection are described by Steele et al.[1996] and Cooper et al.[1999]. Measurements of the important greenhouse gases, CO2 and N2O, show their mixing ratios to be steadily increasing in the atmosphere with mean growth rates in 2001/02 of 2.1 ppm yr-1 and 0.7 ppb yr-1 respectively. On the other hand, the mixing ratio of CH4, another greenhouse gas, has stabilised over the last 3 years. Its growth rate has been trending downward since the start of the record in 1984 and has been near-zero since 2000. These observations are consistent with the results of Dlugokencky et al.[2003], which show the declining CH4 growth rate to be a global phenomenon. The mixing ratio of CO has also been stable in recent years \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1212935368165086810", "cites_id": ["1212935368165086810"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/baseline_2001-2002.pdf#page=53", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Wtb8eko21RAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
