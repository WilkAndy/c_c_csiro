Atmospheric concentrations of CCl4 are higher than expected from currently identified emission sources: largely residual emissions from production, transport and use. Additional sources are required to balance the expected atmospheric destruction of CCl4 and may contribute to a slower-than-expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone \u2018hole\u2019. Abstract Global (1978\u20132012) and Australian (1996\u20132011) carbon tetrachloride emissions are estimated from atmospheric observations of CCl4 using data from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) global network, in particular from Cape Grim, Tasmania. Global and Australian emissions are in decline in response to Montreal Protocol restrictions on CCl4 production and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3730243226169497376", "cites_id": ["3730243226169497376"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/en/en13171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:INejVXN8xDMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 3, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
