These observations have been combined with a range of atmospheric transport models to derive global emission estimates in a top-down approach. HFC-152a is a greenhouse gas with a short atmospheric lifetime of about 1.5 years. Since it does not contain chlorine or bromine, HFC-152a makes no direct contribution to the destruction of stratospheric ozone and is therefore used as a substitute for the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). The concentration of HFC-152a has grown substantially since the first direct measurements in 1994, reaching a maximum annual global growth rate of 0.84\u202f\u202f0.05\u202fppt\u202fyr in 2006, implying a substantial increase in emissions up to 2006. However, since 2007, the annual rate of growth has slowed to 0.38\u202f\u202f0.04\u202fppt\u202fyr in 2010 with a further decline to an annual average rate of growth in 2013\u20132014 of 0.06\u202f\u202f0.05\u202fppt\u202fyr. The annual average Northern Hemisphere (NH) mole fraction in 1994 was 1.2\u202fppt rising to an annual average mole fraction of 10.1\u202fppt in 2014. Average annual mole fractions in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in 1998 and 2014 were 0.84 and 4.5\u202fppt, respectively. We estimate global emissions of HFC-152a have risen from 7.3\u202f\u202f5.6\u202fGg\u202fyr in 1994 to a maximum of 54.4\u202f\u202f17.1\u202fGg\u202fyr in 2011, declining to 52.5\u202f\u202f20.1\u202fGg\u202fyr in 2014 or 7.2\u202f\u202f2.8\u202fTg-CO\u202feq \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16364890206647149611", "cites_id": ["16364890206647149611"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/16/365/2016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:K-R4I_DEG-MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 11, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
