Their atmospheric histories are based on measurements of 36 Northern Hemisphere and 46 Southern Hemisphere archived air samples collected between 1973 to 2011 using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) \"Medusa\" preconcentration gas chromatography-mass spectrometry systems. A new calibration scale was prepared for each PFC, with estimated accuracies of 6.8% for C4F10, 7.8% for C5F12, 4.0% for C6F14, 6.6% for C7F16 and 7.9% for C8F18. Based on our observations the 2011 globally averaged dry air mole fractions of these heavy PFCs are: 0.17 parts-per-trillion (ppt, i.e., parts per 1012) for C4F10, 0.12 ppt for C5F12, 0.27 ppt for C6F14, 0.12 ppt for C7F16 and 0.09 ppt for C8F18. These atmospheric mole fractions combine to contribute to a global average radiative forcing of 0.35 mW m\u22122, which is 6% of the total anthropogenic PFC radiative forcing (Montzka and Reimann, 2011; Oram et al., 2012). The growth rates of the heavy perfluorocarbons were largest in the late 1990s peaking at 6.2 parts per quadrillion (ppq, i.e., parts per 1015) per year (yr) for C4F10, at 5.0 ppq yr\u22121 for C5F12 and 16.6 ppq yr\u22121 for C6F14 and in the early 1990s for C7F16 at 4.7 ppq yr\u22121 and in the mid 1990s for C8F18 at 4.8 ppq yr\u22121. The 2011 globally averaged mean atmospheric growth rates of these PFCs are subsequently lower at 2.2 ppq yr\u22121 for C4F10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RWaEWg4AAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8802466951953959397", "cites_id": ["8802466951953959397"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/4313/2012/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5clUKg6lKHoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
