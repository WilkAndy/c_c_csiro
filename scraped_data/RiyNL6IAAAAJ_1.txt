With these factors taken into account, an (admittedly approximate) analysis is developed which predicts orders of magnitude and general behavior in satisfactory agreement with the experimental facts.An important implication of the present approach is that experimental methods used to distinguish between liquid and vapor transfer have \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 3269, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3666750189750378990,2803156730481476942", "cites_id": ["3666750189750378990", "2803156730481476942"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/tr038i002p00222", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7uEqzN7p4jIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 20, "1985": 30, "1986": 35, "1987": 25, "1988": 37, "1989": 44, "1990": 49, "1991": 41, "1992": 30, "1993": 48, "1994": 43, "1995": 65, "1996": 69, "1997": 56, "1998": 64, "1999": 72, "2000": 70, "2001": 62, "2002": 80, "2003": 78, "2004": 73, "2005": 85, "2006": 83, "2007": 77, "2008": 63, "2009": 90, "2010": 101, "2011": 81, "2012": 104, "2013": 111, "2014": 105, "2015": 106, "2016": 120, "2017": 113, "2018": 113, "2019": 111, "2020": 133, "2021": 121, "2022": 130, "2023": 57}}
