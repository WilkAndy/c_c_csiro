In a subsequent paper (3), we will return to the discussion of the solution of the infiltration equation found in (2) and its contribution to the understanding of the physics of infiltration. Herein we will consider the interesting problem of what happens during infiltration (into a semi-infinite column) as t\u2014\u00bb o. Clearly, we cannot secure the answer by using series (36) of (2), since this series converges only for finite t. The fourterm solution of the numerical example given in the earlier paper (2) rapidly becomes unreliable as t increases beyond 106 sec; to use more terms of the series would extend the range of accurate results only by small amounts, quite disproportionate to the extra labor involved. In any case, the method must fail \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 282, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7383586796305942892", "cites_id": ["7383586796305942892"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1957/06000/The_Theory_of_Infiltration__2__the_Profile_of.3.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bIkUQhLFd2YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 4, "1985": 1, "1986": 6, "1987": 2, "1988": 6, "1989": 4, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 3, "1994": 4, "1995": 6, "1996": 7, "1997": 6, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 8, "2004": 6, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 7, "2008": 2, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 6, "2018": 9, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 7, "2022": 10}}
