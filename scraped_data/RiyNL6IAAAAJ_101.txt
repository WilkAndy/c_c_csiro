THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE MECHANICS OF FLUIDS IN SATURATED POROUS SOLIDS AND CLASSICAL HYDRODYNAMICS ARE DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE PERMEABILITY TENSOR MAY BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF PRECISE INTEGRALS OF THE INTERNAL GEOMETRY OF THE SOLID. METHODS OF USING THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATION TO COMPUTE THE PERMEABILITY OF A POROUS SOLID IN THIS WAY ARE OUTLINED. THE LIMITS TO DRACY'S LAW ARISING FROM THE INERTIA TERMS, AND FROM VARIATION IN TIME OF THE APPLIED POTENTIAL, ARE DISCUSSED. RECENT STUDIES ARE REVIEWED OF WATER MOVEMENT (LIQUID AND VAPOR PHASES) IN UNSATURATED POROUS SOLIDS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITY, AND MOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS. SOME ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE ADSORBED PHASE, AND TO HEAT TRANSFER IN THE SOLID. A COHERENT MATHEMATICAL-PHYSICAL THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WAS PROVED TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS OF A DIVERSITY OF PHENOMENA. HOWEVER, THE THEORY IS INCOMPLETE, IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOES NOT DEAL ADEQUATELY WITH ALL ASPECTS OF WATER MOVEMENT IN SOILS OF HIGH COLLOID CONTENT. THE THEORETICAL STRUCTURE PRESENTED WAS DEVELOPED IN THE AGROHYDROLOGIC CONTEXT, AND THERE ARE LIMITS TO ITS APPLICABILITY TO FOUNDATION PROBLEMS.
