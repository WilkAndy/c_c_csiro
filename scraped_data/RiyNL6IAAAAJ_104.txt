The problem of the diffusion consequent on a step-function change of concentration at the surface of a semi-infinite column of such a medium is solved by means of the Laplace transformation. The solution, simpler than those already in the literature, is well adapted to the detection of dead-end porosity by diffusion observations, a matter of current interest in soil physics. The diffusion initially follows a (time)) law and, at sufficiently large times, follows a second law of this type. The ratio of the two coefficients is a simple function of the ratio of dead-end porosity to active porosity. A study of the characteristic time of local equilibration indicates, however, that deviations from simple diffusion are limited to a small initial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3248868609603960356", "cites_id": ["3248868609603960356"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9680021", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JH5chclMFi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 2, "1983": 3, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
