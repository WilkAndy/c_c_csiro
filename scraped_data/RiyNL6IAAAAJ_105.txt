It has been much employed for moisture estimation because of the strong dependence of C on soil water content. The present study investigates the effectiveness of dual probes near heterogeneities. Exact solutions are found for four probe/soil configurations involving heterogeneity. In one configuration the heating probe is on the plane interface between different soils. For the three other configurations it is located close to three different discontinuities: near a soil surface and outside, and behind, a wetting front. Heterogeneity errors are found to be small provided the heterogeneity is no closer to the probes than probe separation (typically 0.006 m). Estimates of C may provide good resolution of soil water content in critical regions such as near surfaces and fronts."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4262157802297512750", "cites_id": ["4262157802297512750"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1999.6361579x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LlOadvA5JjsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
