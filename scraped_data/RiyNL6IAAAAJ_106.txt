We are thus the special group of people for whom LA does not mean the city of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los Angeles, but the Grand Old Man who makes his home eighty smoggy miles to the east of it. When I was at Caltech in 1958, my old friend and colleague, D. A. de Vries, came through Pasadena on his way back from Australia to the Netherlands. De Vries remembered the kindly interest Richards had taken in his thesis work during the Fourth International Congress of Soil Science held in Amsterdam in 1950. I took him to Riverside to meet Richards, who received us cordially and promptly put us through our paces. What, we were asked, was the moisture potential? Fortunately, we knew our catechism: we avoided the pitfall of talking about pressure and replied faithfully that it was energy per unitweight. 2My set task \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14417432924778290618", "cites_id": ["14417432924778290618"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1972/04000/FUTURE_PROBLEMS_OF_SOIL_WATER_RESEARCH.9.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ul1uttsCFcgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 2, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 7, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
