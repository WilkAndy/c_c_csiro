Various classical concepts of groundwater hydrology fail completely for swelling soils. The distributions of saturation and of hydraulic conductivity relative to the water table differ entirely from the conventional picture. Variations in surface topography affect moisture distribution in swelling soils. The theory of this effect is developed for topographies that are not too steep and is illustrated by examples. The equilibrium distributions found would be classically interpreted as disequilibrium states persisting because of small hydraulic conductivity; but, in fact, the moisture differentials are maintained, not by a lack of conductivity, but by a lack of difference in total potential. The variation of specific yield with water table elevation and stratum thickness in swelling soils is basically different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4399677527127409661", "cites_id": ["4399677527127409661"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9690121", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_cOygmbLDj0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 4, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
