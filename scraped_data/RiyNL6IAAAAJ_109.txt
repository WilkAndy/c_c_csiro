The present study gives an analytical solution to the full air-flow equation, with the corresponding boundary-layer solution for comparison. The full solution predicts sparging below the air-injection point, whereas the boundary-layer solution does not. Solutions are expressed both in terms of the dimensionless Kirchhoff potential \u03b8 (increasing monotonically with capillary pressure and air saturation also) and the dimensionless Stokes stream function F (mapping the pattern of air flow). Both \u03b8 and F show the full solution predicting more effective sparging near the injection point than does the boundary-layer solution. The overall boundary-layer relative error, however, decreases as dimensionless air-injection depth below the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1800171836076698163", "cites_id": ["1800171836076698163"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772298000734", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M6oDSL9--xgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
