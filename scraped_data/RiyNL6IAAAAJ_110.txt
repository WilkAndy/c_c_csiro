This illustrated account of a short visit to Dijon, his native town, reveals little\u2010known aspects of Darcy's character, life, and work. The central square and town gardens are named after Darcy, as are numerous commercial and public undertakings: a cinema, bus stop, a garage, a multistory car park, a pharmacy, and a shopping arcade. Inquiry revealed that Henry Darcy himself has been forgotten by the citizens of Dijon, and that his name persists only as a ubiquitous geographical label. It was not always thus. Darcy, with great vision and skill, designed and built a pure water supply system for Dijon, in place of previous squalor and filth. Dijon became a model for the rest of Europe. Darcy selflessly waived fees due to him from the town, corresponding to about $1.5 million today.
