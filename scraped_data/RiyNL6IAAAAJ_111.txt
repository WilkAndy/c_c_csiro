We establish new similarity solutions for instantaneous sources of finite strength redistributed by nonlinear convection-diffusion obeying the dimensionless equation \u2202\u03b8/\u2202t = \u2202 (\u03b8m \u2202\u03b8/\u2202z) \u2212 \u03b8m+1 \u2202\u03b8/\u2202z (m \u2265 0). For m = 0 (Burgers\u2019 equation) solutions involve the error function, and for m = 1 Airy functions. Problems 1, 2, and 3 relate, respectively, to the regions 0 \u2264 z \u2264 \u221e, \u2013\u221e \u2264 z \u2264 \u221e, and \u2013\u221e \u2264 z \u2264 0. Solutions for m = 0 have infinite tails, but for m > 0 and finite t, \u03b8 > 0 inside, and \u03b8 = 0 outside, a finite interval in z. At the slug boundary, \u03b8(z) is tangential to the z-axis for 0 < m < 1; and it meets the axis obliquely for m = 1 and normally for m > 1. Illustrative results are presented. For Problems 1 and 2 (but not 3) finiteness of source strength sets an upper bound on \u03980, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7303636784695209792", "cites_id": ["7303636784695209792"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anziam-journal/article/exact-solutions-for-redistribution-by-nonlinear-convectiondiffusion/5799164638E739563F658D9A1F07498E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QO87mPW6W2UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
