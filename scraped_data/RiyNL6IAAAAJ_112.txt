The remarkably simple result for \u03d1max, the maximum dimensionless potential at the cavity wall, is \u03d1max(\u03c3) \u223c 2\u03c3 + f0(h) + [f1(h)/\u03c3] + ]f2(h)/\u03c32 + \u2026 where \u03c3=\u00bd \u03b1k\u22121 (\u03b1 is sorptive number; k is apical total curvature) and the fn are polynomials in h\u22122 of degree (n + 1). The results agree, as they should, with previous results for the circular cylinder and sphere (h=1) and the parabolic cylinder and paraboloid (h=\u221e). Connections noted in earlier studies between apical sharpness and the variation of potential along the cavity wall are generalized and made quantitative. The singular (h =0) strip and disc are of especial interest: they indicate behavior near the critical upstream stagnation point on cavities (and impermeable obstacles) with flat strip\u2010 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1648512379519254496", "cites_id": ["1648512379519254496"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR025i007p01531", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4D8UZUax4BYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
