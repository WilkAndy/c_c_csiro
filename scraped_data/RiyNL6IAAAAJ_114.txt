Specific topics include: the joining problem in one-dimensional infiltration; the utility of the Burgers or Knight soil in one-dimensional flow; the importance of the Broadbridge-White soil in constant-flux one-dimensional infiltration; Broadbridge\u2019s result on the nonexistence of linearizing transformations of Burgers\u2019 equation in two dimensions (which probably carries over to three); the power of the flux-concentration method; the wide applicability of the quasilinear analysis of multidimensional steady flows, much enhanced by the scattering analogue; and quasilinear results on the watertightness or otherwise to downward unsaturated seepage of macropores, holes, tunnels, and underground cavities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16387050919483248456", "cites_id": ["16387050919483248456"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-73845-6_3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SI8JLP1_auMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 4, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 5, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 1}}
