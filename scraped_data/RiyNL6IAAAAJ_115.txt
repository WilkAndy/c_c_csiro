The paper reviews recent progress in the theory of water equilibrium and movement in swelling soils, and emphasizes that neglect of the fact of swelling may lead to serious errors of interpretation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6241686880462404988", "cites_id": ["6241686880462404988"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-01391-3_6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fH0t3SXtnlYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
