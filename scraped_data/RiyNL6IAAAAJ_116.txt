The solutions may be used to estimate post-irrigation redistribution of finite slugs of water applied from such sources. Illustrative examples deal with the redistribution of initial slugs of water originating from plane, line, and point sources near the soil surface. The solutions apply to a diversity of configurations encountered in irrigation practice. The principal limitation to their use lies in the need to match soil hydraulic and capillary properties to the power laws; but matching in some integral sense may give information of ample accuracy for engineering purposes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2732586150283505162", "cites_id": ["2732586150283505162"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00190520", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Cu7MNaAY7CUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
