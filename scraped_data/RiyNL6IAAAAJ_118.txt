An approximate analysis gives the result that the time of the effective establishment of the steady motion is proportional to the permeability and inversely proportional to the kinematic viscosity. Two exact solutions (one of them new) for simple cases suggest that the approximate analysis is remarkably accurate. An analogy between this problem and one in heat conduction makes the relevant results in that field immediately applicable here."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18016632020175353697", "cites_id": ["18016632020175353697"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/ph/PH570043", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yfd6u13vB_oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
