The classical, single-particle, theory of regelation is here extended to transverse, longitudinal, and square infinite arrays of cylindrical particles, for the case, as in soils, where heat-conduction is the rate-governing process. Detailed maps are presented of the steady thermal fields required for steady regelation, independent of the mechanism of melting point perturbation. For space-filling configurations of particles, steady regelation requires an overall macroscopic temperature gradient, associated with a systematic overall gradient of ice pressure. Four distinct heat flow paths are found on the microscopic scale: through the particle; through the ice from hot to cold surfaces of the one particle; through the ice between the hot surface of one particle and the cold surface of its neighbor; through ice alone down the macroscopic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 33, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18078704287618858380", "cites_id": ["18078704287618858380"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165232X80900257", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jH3atsN15PoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 2, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
