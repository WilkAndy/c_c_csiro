Here we consider in further detail the influence on this phenomenon of the initial moisture content of the soil. 2 It has long been known that the initial moisture content exerts a profound effect on infiltration, but, to date, studies of the question have been largely empirical (8, 16). A simplified model of infiltration proposed by the author (9) led to an approximate theory of the dependence of infiltration on moisture content. Although the present paper is devoted mainly to exploring the implications of the more refined analysis developed in this series, the earlier approximate theory will also receive some attention."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 258, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2012565662274495662", "cites_id": ["2012565662274495662"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1957/10000/the_Theory_of_Infiltration__5__the_Influence_of.8.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:riQFi84R7hsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 2, "1986": 3, "1987": 3, "1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 5, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 11, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 9, "2010": 9, "2011": 2, "2012": 7, "2013": 10, "2014": 9, "2015": 8, "2016": 6, "2017": 8, "2018": 7, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
