We use the method, together with a new integral result for the ratio A/K, to investigate the, hitherto imperfectly understood, physical determinants of A/K1. K1 is the saturated conductivity, and A the second coefficient of the two\u2010term infiltration equation i = St1/2 + At. We separate out the relatively superficial direct effect of the initial moisture content \u03b80 (important only when \u03b80 is very large) from the more complicated effect, dependent both on soil texture and on \u03b80, of the shapes of the diffusivity D and the conductivity derivative dK/d\u03b8. Normalized first moments of these functions measure the steepness of their variation. We explore the full range of combinations of shapes of D and dK/d\u03b8 from essentially flat to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17994931055875747359", "cites_id": ["17994931055875747359"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR026i009p02023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:H24eP3TWuvkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
