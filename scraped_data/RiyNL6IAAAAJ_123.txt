Like the earlier work for one-dimensional regions, the present study depends centrally on Sturm-Liouville comparison theorems.The results are qualitatively similar to those for one dimension. An important quantitative difference is that the range of central densities for which stable steady distributions are possible is significantly less."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12525910623119913384", "cites_id": ["12525910623119913384"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519370901165", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qLFau1j51K0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
