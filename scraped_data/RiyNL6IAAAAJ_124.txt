This study yields bounds on the relative magnitude of the two types of losses. Quasilinear results on evaporation from buried steady sources are used to investigate the effects of source depth and root sink depth on soil evaporation and deep\u2010percolation losses from subirrigated crops. The study quantifies the concept that the deeper the source relative to the roots the smaller the soil evaporation loss and the larger the deep\u2010percolation loss."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6418074977438642726", "cites_id": ["6418074977438642726"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1991.03615995005500060003x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JrINBDCVEVkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
