This study yields upper bounds on fractional evaporation loss from buried sources. Quasilinear solutions are given for evaporation at the soil surface from buried steady point and line sources at finite depth. These yield the very general result that e\u20102z1 is the upper bound on the fractional evaporation loss from any arbitrary configuration of steady sources at dimensionless depth z1. This dimensionless depth is the ratio of the physical depth to the sorptive length 2\u03b1\u22121, where \u03b1 is the sorptive number entering the quasilinear analysis. A simple general theorem gives the upper bound on fractional evaporation loss from arbitrary configurations of steady sources distributed throughout an arbitrary range of depths."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10845935790607190784", "cites_id": ["10845935790607190784"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1991.03615995005500060002x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AEvWJyOBhJYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
