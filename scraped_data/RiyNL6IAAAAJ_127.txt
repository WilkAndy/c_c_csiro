The application of scalar field theory to soil-water is reviewed in (6). This approach was used recently (16) to establish that \u0424, the total potential governing vertical equilibrium and movement of water in a swefiing soil is made up of three components2, the moisture (or matric) potential \u0424, the gravitational potential-z, and the overburden potential f\u00ec, so that"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9947229609496994892", "cites_id": ["9947229609496994892"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1970/05000/Hydrostatics_in_Swelling_Soils_and_Soil.6.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TORQjaCoC4oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
