Solutions are given both for the Kirchhoff variable \u2297 and the stream function \u03c6. They are explored in detail for . For each solution emphasis is placed on determining the limits on v0 (x) which ensure that the moisture potential \u03a8 \u2a7d 0, so that the quasilinear formulation is applicable. This essential precaution has sometimes been disregarded. The presence of a water table strongly influences \u2297, but has relatively little effect on \u03c6. This makes possible important mathematical simplifications. Remarkably, simple exact solutions are found for travel times. They reveal singularities in the travel\u2010time functions overlooked in previous work using a finite difference method. For large times, the family of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8739703079835282231", "cites_id": ["8739703079835282231"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800040009x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nyv4a6WpSXkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
