The (justifiable) approximation that the phenomenon is radial leads to important simplifications. An exact similarity solution is found which is valid for the early stages of the condensation process. An approximate method of analysis is developed, using the class of similarity solutions of the two\u2010dimensional radial diffusion problem with a constant concentration condition at an appropriately moving boundary. The method has some analogies to the Pohlhausen method in fluid mechanics in that the initial and boundary conditions are satisfied exactly, and the diffusion equation is satisfied in an integral sense. The method depends on numerical methods of integration, but approximate analytical solutions are available when the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17619973293697403860", "cites_id": ["17619973293697403860"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1726032", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1Au0Ilu4hvQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 6, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
