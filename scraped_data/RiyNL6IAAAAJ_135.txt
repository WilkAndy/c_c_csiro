The required solutions are readily deduced from the known simple solutions for buried line and point sources. Corollary to the theorems, similar relations hold for downslope and cross\u2010slope flux density components. Illustrative solutions are presented for line and point sources in the various configurations. Distributions of both potential and stream function are mapped for line sources and also for point sources at or beneath a horizontal surface. For other point sources, potential is mapped in the normal plane through the source. For sources beneath a surface, distortion due to the surface is relatively small, even for dimensionless normal source depth as small as 1.
