The conductivity tensor is assumed to have principal components K(\u03a8), K(\u03a8), and \u03bc2K(\u03a8), the third of these in the vertical direction. Here \u03bc2 is the anisotropy, and \u03a8 is the moisture potential. Scattering analog techniques are used to secure the required solutions. The exact solutions involve spheroidal wave functions; but, more usefully, we express the far field wetting function and the discharge function as expansions appropriate for small and large values of s, the dimensionless transformed equatorial radius of the cavity. A joining technique is used to establish estimates of the discharge function throughout the ranges 0 \u2264 s \u2264 \u221e, 0 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 20, with transformed aspect ratio \u03c9 = \u03bc\u22121 v.
