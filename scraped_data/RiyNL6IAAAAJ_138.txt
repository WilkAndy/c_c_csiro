Power-law representations of the vertical profiles of mean wind speed and eddy diffusivity lead to solutions in terms of Kelvin and trigonometric functions.These solutions are used to determine blending heights (\u017d*), where deviations from the mean of concentration, or of vertical flux density, fall to some small fraction, \u03b4, of their value at the surface. Values of \u017d*are important for regional and larger-scale meteorological models. In smaller scale micrometeorological studies, they may serve also as the top levels of surface boundary layers.An important result for both theoretical and experimental contexts is that deviations of flux persist with elevation much more strongly than those of concentration, so that, in general, \u017d* should be based on flux rather than concentration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3404151922714523471", "cites_id": ["3404151922714523471"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00119575", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T7fcQiP6PS8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1}}
