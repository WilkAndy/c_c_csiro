In this paper analogous theorems are proved for two\u2010 and three\u2010dimensional quasi\u2010linear steady flows in saturated soils from finite cavities of arbitrary size and shape, with arbitrary boundary conditions on the cavity surface. These theorems connect \u201cdownward wetting functions\u201d and total cavity flow rates. Simple relations are established between scattering functions in the wave context and wetting functions in the soil water context. The important consequence is that flow rates for a large range of cavity shapes can be inferred simply and directly from extant results on forward scattering functions. It is proved that at large r (dimensionless radius), flow is concentrated in a small angular region vertically beneath the cavity and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16864471541900094441", "cites_id": ["16864471541900094441"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR021i012p01889", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6auj-4OjCuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 3, "1989": 4, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
