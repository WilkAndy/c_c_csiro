(A) relates the variation of contact frequency with quadrat angle, f(\u03b2), to the distribution of foliage deiisity with foliage angle, &(\u03b1) (Philip 1965a). (B), app!icab!e to stems or stem-like organs, relates f (\u03b2) to the distribution of foliage (stem surface) density with axial angle h(\u03b3); and (C) connects g(\u03b1) and h(\u03b3). A trio of integral equations analogous to (A), (B), (C) holds for any class of axisymmetrical organs whose members are geometrically similar. The utility nf these equations in practice depends on the differential order of their solutions: the higher the order, the greater the amplification of errors. The order is 2\u00bd for (A) and 3 for (B). Reliable results on the distribution of stem axial angles thus require very accurate data (and hence a great deal of labour). The kernels entering (A), (B), and (C) are basic, not only to \"integral equation\" studies of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6801139045736452608", "cites_id": ["6801139045736452608"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/bt/bt9660105", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ABIpme1_Yl4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
