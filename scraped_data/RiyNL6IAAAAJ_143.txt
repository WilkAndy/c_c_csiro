Asymptotic analyses are given of two\u2010 and three\u2010dimensional seepage above a sloping impermeable base, valid far from the water supply source(s). The solutions depend only on total source discharge: details of source configuration are irrelevant. We require only that the total discharge be positive and finite and that the sources be contained in a finite region. Two\u2010dimensional results are found both for quasi\u2010linear and for general nonlinear flows. The general results apply also to mixed saturated\u2010unsaturated flows. The asymptotic three\u2010dimensional quasi\u2010linear results involve the same functional forms as analogous two\u2010dimensional flows in unbounded regions. An upper bound on unsaturated total discharge exists for two\u2010dimensional systems.
