Detailed results are presented for cylindrical and toroidal cavities with aspect ratio (\u03bb) arbitrary. The critical R for applicability of the analysis is O (\u03bb 3 2) at large \u03bb, O (1) in 0.1\u2a7d \u03bb\u2a7d-1, and at smalll \u03bb is O (\u03bb\u2212 1 2) for toroidsand O (\u03bb 1 2)[-In\u03bb]\u2212 1 for cylinders The exact solutions for toroids offer insight into the toroidal roll characteristic of axisymmetric convection at small R. For cylinders (and also for 2-dim. convection at small R in rectangles) a core flow with boundary layers occurs both as \u03bb\u2192 0 and as \u03bb\u2192 \u03b1. On the other hand, the flow pattern in toroids (and also in ellipses) is invariant, free of cores and boundary layers. Close analogies between axisymmetric and 2-dim. convection at small R hold also for properties such as the variation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3929508945666543023", "cites_id": ["3929508945666543023"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001793108290148X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r40sEJFriDYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 2}}
