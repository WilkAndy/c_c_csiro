The theorem is established that such flows are independent of cavity orientation. The appropriate (rotation-invariant) characteristic length is thus A 1 2 (A, cross-sectional area). Exact solutions are presented in detail for rectangular and elliptical cavities with \u03bb (ratio of long to short axis) arbitrary, and for equilateral triangular cavities. The critical Rayleigh number for applicability of the analysis is about 1 for cavities with long axis horizontal, and about \u03bb 2 with long axis vertical. Simple exact solutions exist also for cavities of other shapes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2924817657165317874", "cites_id": ["2924817657165317874"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0017931082900291", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8gYhsCkKlygJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
