Energies of interaction are conveniently treated in terms of the partial volumetric Gibbs free energy. Calculations use (in part) a simple \u201cmatched Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel approximation\u201d to exact solutions of the nonlinear Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation. Geometrical effects exert a dominant influence on the variation of partial Gibbs free energy with particle area per unit volume of solution. Evaluation of the relative importance of double\u2010layer interactions and particle Brownian motion provides a check on the cell model. Results for the three\u2010dimensional swarm are found to be consistent with available estimates of the repulsive force between two spherical particles. Application of the approach to heterogeneous swarms is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10984539721785988780", "cites_id": ["10984539721785988780"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1673142", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rNY4qq3scJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
