Raats recently proposed as the criterion for instability that wetting front velocity should increase with front penetration. This detailed analysis, on the other hand, shows that the fundamental criterion is that the water pressure gradient immediately behind the front should oppose the flow. The two criteria agree only in the special case where five significant parameters of the system are all constant and independent of depth, or of depth to the front. The Raats criterion fails in the various more general cases with one or more of these quantities variable.Quantitative criteria are developed for various specific circumstances in which the flow may become unstable: penetration to a non\u2010wetting stratum; compression of air ahead of the front; redistribution following infiltration; increase of conductivity with depth.The analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 249, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15613750229566048827", "cites_id": ["15613750229566048827"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900060013x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O0r1zBsvr9gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 3, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 11, "1989": 5, "1990": 4, "1991": 3, "1992": 4, "1993": 7, "1994": 5, "1995": 6, "1996": 17, "1997": 4, "1998": 13, "1999": 7, "2000": 11, "2001": 10, "2002": 10, "2003": 12, "2004": 8, "2005": 12, "2006": 5, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
