Fuchs\u2019 (1959) attempt to study the validity of QS is marred by a number of errors (which are identified in the present work). This paper presents a critical examination of QS, largely based on mathematical methods capable of establishing the accuracy of QS in cases where the exact solution is unavailable.             Exact similarity solutions for             n             -dimensional condensation (zero initial radius) are presented. These, and an exact solution for diffusion about a spherical body of constant radius, provide points of departure for the development of two simple and powerful approximate methods, a perturbation method and a continuity-preserving quasi-stationary analysis (CPQS). The perturbation method provides an apparently highly accurate means of using the relevant known \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12758372802876057003", "cites_id": ["12758372802876057003"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/22/2/1520-0469_1965_022_0196_kogaeo_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q6Vuq3fYDrEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
