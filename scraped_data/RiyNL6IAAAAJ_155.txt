The needle, sphere, and disc are special cases. Apart from their direct relevance to systems with gravity negligible, our results yield the leading terms of expansions describing steady infiltration into such soils for small and moderate values of the dimensionless cavity length. The effectively wetted region is a spheroid with aspect ratio \u00b5, where \u00b52 is the anisotropy. The analysis suggests that, in anisotropic soils, vertical conductivity influences the capillary component of flow much more strongly for disc permeameters than for borehole permeameters. Generalizations of the problem solved in detail involve (i) inequality of the three conductivity principal components, (ii) cavity axes skew to conductivity axes, (iii) ellipsoidal cavities.
