Power-law representations of the vertical profiles of mean windspeed and (downwind and transverse) eddy diffusivity lead to solutions in terms of Bessel functions of complex argument. As in previous work on one-dimensional checkerboards, the solutions yield blending heights for both concentration and flux. These are important for regional and larger-scale models, serving also as top levels of smaller-scale surface models.This study treats the case with wind direction normal and parallel to the check boundaries. For this orientation it is only when the transverse wavelength is small that results differ much from those for one-dimensional checkerboards. For square checks the difference is significant only for pattern \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14138073180120686468", "cites_id": ["14138073180120686468"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00119009", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hB-SjaaGNMQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
