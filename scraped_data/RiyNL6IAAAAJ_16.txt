Buried holes serve as obstacles to the flow and so increase water pressure at parts of the hole surface. When downward seepage is fast enough and/or the hole is large enough, water pressure increases to the point where a seepage surface forms and water enters the hole. Contrary to the conventional picture drawn from capillary statics, hydrodynamics shows that the larger the hole the more vulnerable it is to water entry. Cavity shape is important also. Applications include optimal design of configurations of tunnels and underground repositories (e.g., for nuclear wastes) against entry of seepage water. The theory also embraces the disturbance of seepage flows by buried impermeable obstacles such as stones and structures.
