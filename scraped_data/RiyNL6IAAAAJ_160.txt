What is the relation between growth of the internalboundary-layer height downwind of a step in surfaceconditions, and the increase of blending height withdownwind pattern wavelength? 2. Can the approach beextended to shear stress? The answers are: 1. Thedependence of boundary-layer height on fetch has thesame functional form as that of blending height onwavelength; but it is greater by a factor of about1.9. 2. Representing eddy diffusivity as the productof mean windspeed and a power of height gives a linearhorizontal momentum equation. A further approximationgives a convection-diffusion equation for shearstress, analogous to those used previously forscalars."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13897459002965351896", "cites_id": ["13897459002965351896"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1000345015838", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2N1N0FSx3cAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
