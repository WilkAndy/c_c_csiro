SAO/NASA ADS Physics Abstract \nService TRANSIENT HEAT CONDUCTION BETWEEN A SPHERE AND A SURROUNDING \nMEDIIJTM OF DIFFERENT THERMAL PROPERTIES By JR PBn.Tr* [Manuscript received July \n6, 1964] Summary The paper treats the redistribution of heat between a sphere and an iaftnite \nmedium of different thermal properties and different initial temperature. The problem is relevant \nto two geophysical questions: the cooling of laccoliths, and the psychrometry of the growth \nand evaporation of droplets and ice crystals. Laplace transformation methods yield the formal \nsolution. The time courses of the temperature at the sphere surface, and of the heat flux across \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5625184758369863350", "cites_id": ["5625184758369863350"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1964AuJPh..17..423P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tsaT9rurEE4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
