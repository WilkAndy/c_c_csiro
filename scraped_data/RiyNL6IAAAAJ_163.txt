Frequently the series is found to converge rapidly, and accurate solutions may be obtained from its first few terms. At large values of t, however, the convergence of series (2) may fail. In this case, an alternative method of solution, involving the\" profile at infinity,\" is required (4). We consider this solution for large t at a later point in the paper.As for the absorption case, we may apply equation (6) of reference (6) to the solution and so obtain an expression giving the viscous dissipation of energy at any point as a function of t. In this case we obtain, after some manipulation, the equation"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2867460617162719652", "cites_id": ["2867460617162719652"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/citation/1960/06000/energy_dissipation_during_absorption_and.10.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pAFoJT1EyycJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
