Material-conserving instantaneous source solutions of A are reviewed as an entr\u00e9e to material-losing solutions. Simple physical arguments show that solutions for a finite slug losing material at infinity at a finite nonzero rate can exist only for the following m-ranges: 0 < s < 2, \u22122s\u22121 < m \u2264 \u22121; s > 2, \u22121 < m < \u22122s\u22121. The result for s = 1 was known previously. The case s = 2, m = \u22121, needs further investigation. Three different similarity schemes all lead to the same ordinary differential equation. For 0 < s < 2, parameter \u03b3 (0 < \u03b3 < \u221e) in that equation discriminates between the three classes of solution: class 1 gives the concentration scale decreasing as a negative power of (1 + t/T); 2 gives exponential decrease; and 3 gives decrease as a positive power of (1 \u2212 t/T), the solution vanishing at t = T < \u221e. Solutions for s = 1, are presented \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14145293724691510526,10747536749783561854", "cites_id": ["14145293724691510526", "10747536749783561854"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anziam-journal/article/fast-diffusion-with-loss-at-infinity/8C9B79177038523C6075EEF5BDEA0527", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_rTMl7ItTsQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
