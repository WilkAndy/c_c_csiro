Generalisations of this approach to two- and three-component horizontal systems in swelling media are described.The generalization to vertical systems demands reconsideration of hydrostatics in swelling media. The total potential includes, in this case, an additional component, the overburden potential, \u03a9, Evaluation of \u03a9 leads to the condition for equilibrium in the vertical. This reduces to a first-order linear diff. eqn. with singular coefficients. It follows that there are three types of equilibrium profile: hydric profiles with the moisture gradient d\u03b8/dz < 0; pycnotatic profiles with d\u03b8/dz = 0; and xeric profiles with d\u03b8/dz > 0. Both hydric and xeric profiles approach the pycnotatic state (of maximum apparent specific gravity) in depth.
