The energetics of such phenomena is. strictly, a matter for the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. However, the linear theory developed and presented by Onsager (6, 7), Prigogine (18), and de Groot (3), does not seem applicable to the essentially nonlinear soilwater problem.This together with a subsequent paper provides a detailed analysis of the energetics of absorption and infiltration, which connects with the\" diffusion analysis\" of these processes developed in recent years (4, 12, 15). A remark on the relation of the present work to\" heat of wetting\" or\" heat of absorption\" is perhaps desirable. This concept of classical thermodynamics depends on treatment of the processes oi absorption and desorption as reversible, ie, the heat consumed in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=34666981430276158", "cites_id": ["34666981430276158"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1960/03000/ENERGY_DISSIPATION_DURING_ABSORPTION_AND.3.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PjCWmW8pewAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
