The formulation represents the generalization to media subject to volume change of the well-established phenomenological approach to flow in non-swelling media primarily established in the context of soil physics. The one-dimensional generalization to swelling media is straightforward, and may be usefully applied to practical one-dimensional systems, including three-component systems with solid particles, water, and air. On the other hand, the further generalizations to two- and three-dimensional systems have not yet been developed fully convincingly. Difficult questions include the mode of stress transmission and the tensorial stress-strain relations in multidimensional and multi-component systems. One means of gaining insight into these questions for media of high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17336999029163711499", "cites_id": ["17336999029163711499"], "pub_url": "https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/appliedmechanicsreviews/article-abstract/48/10/650/401317", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C1yY_MJkmfAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1}}
