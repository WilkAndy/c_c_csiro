There seems a danger that, if it is left unchallenged, Jackson [1992] will set off a new round of confusion in hillslope hydrology, precipitated once more by a misunderstanding about vec-tors.Jackson [1992] supposes that there is downslope flow only when the total flow velocity vector points downslope of the vertical, and he uses this supposition to stand on its head my conclusion [Philip, 1991] that at least under the long-slope assumption, downslope flow occurs during infiltration into a hillslope of homogenous isotropic soil. It must be stressed that Jackson's supposition is absolutely incorrect. Figure 1 depicts a total flow velocity vector V pointing in a direction upslope of the vertical, and its decomposition into two orthogonal components, the downslope \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12757666285512194660", "cites_id": ["12757666285512194660"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/93WR02321", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZHruxuRVDLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1}}
