Refinement of established botanical techniques, based on the absence of preferred compass orientation, leads to three integral equations. Equation (A) relates the variation of contact frequency with quadrat angle, f(\u03b2), to the distribution of foliage density with foliage angle, g(\u03b1). Equation (B), applicable to stem-like organs, relates f(\u03b2) to the distribution of foliage (stem surface) density with axial angle, h(\u03b3); and (C) connects g(\u03b1) and h(\u03b3). The kernel of (A) is known, and those of (B) and (C) are found from geometrical considerations. The solution of (C) is found and combined with that of (A) to yield that of (B). The kernel of (B) involves all three complete elliptic integrals. Three identities involving elliptic integrals follow. A trio of equations analogous to (A), (B), (C) holds for any class of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18139062576731120579", "cites_id": ["18139062576731120579"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/53/3-4/365/246707", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w-OjBE_luvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1966": 1, "1967": 0, "1968": 0, "1969": 1, "1970": 0, "1971": 0, "1972": 0, "1973": 1, "1974": 0, "1975": 0, "1976": 0, "1977": 1, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1}}
