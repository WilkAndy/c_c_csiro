Relevant periodic solutions ofa three-dimensional atmospheric convection-diffusion equation arefound, and used to estimate blending heights for both concentrationand flux.Illustrative results show negligible directional effect on blendingheight for X1* (the smaller pattern wavelength) of 10 m, but a ratio of maximum/minimum heights of about 3 to 5 for X1* = 100 m. For X1* = 1000 mthe directional variation is strongly peaked with a maximum/minimum ratio of 8 to 14. At fixed X1* the maximum increases with check aspect ratio. It is associated withthe case where the wind blows along one check diagonal.
