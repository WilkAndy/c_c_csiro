The long\u2010slope solution neglects any slope crest effect, and a careful analysis of this is needed. The present work reassesses the previous primitive estimate of the crest effect. We solve the problem of linearized infiltration into a symmetrical ridge with 45\u00b0 slope angles. The integral matching of flow behavior gives results of ample accuracy for our purpose. The 45\u00b0 slope is very steep in nature, but yields a simple product solution. We use this to calibrate the previous long\u2010slope criterion for arbitrary slope angle. The primary slope crest effect is increase of moisture content and decrease of capillary potential gradients near the crest. The affected region propagates downslope but its influence on infiltration dynamics tends to dissipate because the relative importance of capillarity diminishes as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:tHtfpZlB6tUC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2434588042215512174", "cites_id": ["2434588042215512174"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91WR02970", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:blir5uxkySEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
