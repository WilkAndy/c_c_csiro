Limits of time, space, and competence would have all conspired to make this so, even in the absence of the editorial injunction that'special interests... be emphasized'.A peculiar difficulty of the topic of flow in porous media is that it arises, often in subtly different forms, in several separate fields of natural science and in a large number of branches of technology. The categories are far from clear-cut, but an enumeration must include fluid mechanics, surface and colloid physical chemistry, physiology, rheology, geophysics, soil physics, hydrology, soil mechanics, agricultural engineering, sanitary engineering, petroleum engineering, chemical engineering, powder metallurgy, metal casting, ceramic engineering, and the technologies of wood, paper, textiles, leather, cement \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 230, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8967081485792909411", "cites_id": ["8967081485792909411"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.fl.02.010170.001141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YxirCBp5cXwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 5, "1988": 7, "1989": 5, "1990": 6, "1991": 2, "1992": 7, "1993": 6, "1994": 0, "1995": 3, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 7, "2003": 5, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 9, "2015": 2, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 11, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 5}}
