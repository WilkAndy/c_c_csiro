He interprets the cycles as due to known periodicities in the intensity of turbulent exchange processes in the atmosphere. Provided that the rate of exhalation of radon from the ground is \u2018essentially independent of the time of day,\u2019 is also independent of the season, and is spatially constant, his interpretation must be the correct one.Unfortunately, his attempt to deduce the daily variation of eddy diffusivity from his observations is not entirely satisfactory."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14513297986022277283", "cites_id": ["14513297986022277283"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ064i012p02468", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:owBAoJ-XackJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1966": 2, "1967": 0, "1968": 0, "1969": 1, "1970": 1, "1971": 0, "1972": 1, "1973": 1, "1974": 0, "1975": 0, "1976": 1, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
