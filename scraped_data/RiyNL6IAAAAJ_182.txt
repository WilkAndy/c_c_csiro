The diffusivity is proportional to a powerm of concentration, with 0 < m \u2264 1; and loss rate is also proportional to a power of concentration,n, with 0 \u2264n < 1. The solutions are for an arbitrary number of dimensionss > 0 withs=1, 2, 3 in physical applications. All solutions give the slug radius finite, increasing to a maximum, and then decreasing to zero in finite time. Withn < 1, the loss rate at small concentrations is large enough to ensure slug extinction in finite time. The corresponding exact solutions for gain, not loss, are given also. They become independent of initial slug quantity in the limit of infinite time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14875536202581958519", "cites_id": ["14875536202581958519"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00945927", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d19cvlyFcM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
