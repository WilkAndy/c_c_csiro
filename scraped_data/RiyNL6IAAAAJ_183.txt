Various exact solutions indicate that a roof boundary-layer analysis centred on the upstream stagnation point, and neglecting peripheral variation, gives to remarkable accuracy the quantity \u03b8max, the crucial dimensionless potential determining whether or not water enters the cavity. The great accuracy of this analysis is attributed to the use of curvilinear coordinates natural to the cavity configuration. Global information (such as up to three separate characteristic lengthscales) is injected into the localized boundary-layer formulation via the metric coefficient of the natural coordinates. These are essential to the boundary-layer analysis. Cartesian coordinates, on the other hand, invariably suggest that no boundary layer \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=195485456769894983", "cites_id": ["195485456769894983"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspa.1990.0037", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R0qGufyAtgIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
