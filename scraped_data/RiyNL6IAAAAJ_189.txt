The relevant flow equation is a strongly nonlinear Fokker-Planck (convection-diffusion) equation. The theory of infiltration (the penetration into a soil mass of water made available at its surface) is described. Solutions fire developed for hillslope topographies. We deal primarily with ponded infiltration, but constant-rainfall infiltration is discussed also. The emphasis is on quasi-analytic and analytic solutions. Fully nonlinear solutions are developed, together with linearized solutions of certain problems. The nonlinear solutions involve either usefully convergent series or travelling waves. The linearizations use product solutions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11608847866174125152", "cites_id": ["11608847866174125152"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-8492-2_16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YDTcwqDpGqEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
