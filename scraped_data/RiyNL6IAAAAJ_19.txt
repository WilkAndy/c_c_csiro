SAO/NASA ADS Physics Abstract \nService GENERAL METHOD OF EXACT SOLUTION OF, TUE CONCENTRATION-DEPENDENT \nDIFFUSION EQUATION By J. B~ pi~r~jp* [Manu8cript received November 11, 1959] Summary \nOnly three forms of D(O) have previously been known to yield exact solutions of the equation \nao ai ao \u2014=--ID(0)- at subject to the conditions 0 = 0, x> 0, t = 0; 0=1; x = 0, t> 0. The present \npaper reports a general method of establishing a very large class of D(O) functions which \nyield exact solutions. A similar method enables exact solutions of the same equation subject \nto 1~1 the conditions O==O, x> 0, and 0 = 1, x<O, t=O; xdO=O, t>O. In this case also Jo a very \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 214, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11486142037398586646", "cites_id": ["11486142037398586646"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1960AuJPh..13....1P", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FgXTqlP5Zp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 3, "1989": 6, "1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 2, "1993": 5, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 6, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 4, "2003": 5, "2004": 10, "2005": 8, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 7, "2010": 8, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
