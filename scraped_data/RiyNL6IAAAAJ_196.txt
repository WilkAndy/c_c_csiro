This exploratory work neglects changes in channel semi-width and hydraulics, and so applies strictly only to small particle concentrations (but also to irreversible adsorption of a solute). A detailed analysis is made of the steady distribution of particle concentration and of particle deposition, which is established relatively rapidly. The mathematics is much simplified by approximating the Poiseuille velocity profile by a power law. A similarity solution is then available for small x (dimensionless downstream distance) with a dominant-mode approximation valid for large x. Particles do not penetrate far down the channel, with the centroids of both suspended and deposited particles being about 0.3 PeZ\u2217 (Pe, P\u00e9clet number; Z \u2217, channel semi-width) from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3572151068955690593", "cites_id": ["3572151068955690593"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000925099400455Z", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YcYinXjUkjEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
