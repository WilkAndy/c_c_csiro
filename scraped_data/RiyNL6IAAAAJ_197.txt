The soil was assumed to obey the assumptions of Green and Ampt (1911), ie the soil is homogeneous, the initial moisture content in the soil is uniform, and the leading edge of the infiltrating water forms a sharp front. The corresponding special case without evaporation was presented by Philip (1992a). Barry et al.(1994) have discussed the latter result, and comments made by them apply to the work of Phillip (1992b) also:Philip's result... is a special ease of a previously published infiltration formula due to Parlange et al.[1985]. The latter holds for arbitrary, time-dependent ponded conditions at the soil surface, and does not require that the soil water diffusivity be proportional to a delta function. Thus, their formula is significantly more general than Philip's."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:s85pQhAUCrAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9247864558388492300", "cites_id": ["9247864558388492300"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169494900132", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DLirjdEDV4AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
