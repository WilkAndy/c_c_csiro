He was as adept in analytical methods as in numerical ones, and he worked with both linear and nonlinear models. An early paper (Bresler 1967) prophetically spanned the range of his concerns. That paper, which continues to receive its share of citations, made fruitful use of linear mathematics. In this contribution we also use both linear and nonlinear analysis to seek insight into fundamentally nonlinear processes of soil-water movement, with the detailed results based on linearization."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10300171400655492556", "cites_id": ["10300171400655492556"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-77947-3_11", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zFW19VCP8Y4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
