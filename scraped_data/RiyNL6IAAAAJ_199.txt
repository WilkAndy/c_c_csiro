This paper gives the closed form solution for the adsorptive potential about a homogeneous solid rectangular corner; and, through systematic superposition, closed form solutions for the following configurations also: the rectangular corner of a cavity; laminae and rectangular cracks occupying a quarter plane; semi-infinite rectangular prisms and prismatic cavities; rectangular parallelepipeds and brick-shaped cavities. These various results are developed in detail for the cases \u03b5=6 and \u03b5=4. The paradox that potentials for \u03b5>3 seem to be obtainable more readily than Newtonian potentials (\u03b5=1) is explained by the existence only for \u03b5>3 of simple fundamental solutions for infinite homogeneous solid configurations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10035136371340459328", "cites_id": ["10035136371340459328"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01601489", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QL1Zflz3Q4sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 1, "1978": 0, "1979": 1, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
