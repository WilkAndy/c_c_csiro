Hydrologists, and their textbooks and handbooks, have tended, nevertheless, to pay relatively little attention to the phenomenon of water movement in unsaturated soils. Most research on this topic has been done by soil physicists, concerned ultimately with agronomic or ecological aspects of hydrology; but their colleagues in engineering hydrology have exhibited an increasing interest in this field in recent years. The present article deals with the theory of infiltration which is one important outcome of the mathematical-physical approach to the study of water movement in unsaturated soils which has been developed over the past 15 years or so, principally in the US, England, and Australia \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C", "num_citations": 2104, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13010249700888295595,14916207549128345883", "cites_id": ["13010249700888295595", "14916207549128345883"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781483199368500106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qziU9CuxjbQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 24, "1985": 27, "1986": 27, "1987": 32, "1988": 35, "1989": 38, "1990": 50, "1991": 34, "1992": 52, "1993": 56, "1994": 34, "1995": 37, "1996": 40, "1997": 49, "1998": 49, "1999": 40, "2000": 45, "2001": 35, "2002": 54, "2003": 50, "2004": 47, "2005": 64, "2006": 49, "2007": 46, "2008": 46, "2009": 45, "2010": 52, "2011": 38, "2012": 48, "2013": 63, "2014": 47, "2015": 32, "2016": 44, "2017": 39, "2018": 56, "2019": 59, "2020": 54, "2021": 66, "2022": 39, "2023": 17}}
