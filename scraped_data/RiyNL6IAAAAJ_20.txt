The integral results may be inferred from the velocity distributions at the slots only. This simplicity of integral properties holds for a wider class of flows subject to mixed conditions: the no-shear slots may be distributed irregularly and may occur in two separate surfaces (parallel plates or concentric tubes). It carries over also to analogous slow flows with arbitrary distributions of no-shear patches in the boundaries. The work yields a number of definite integrals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC", "num_citations": 208, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17680347834535277443", "cites_id": ["17680347834535277443"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/bf01596223", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g3PSVq42XfUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 8, "2006": 4, "2007": 8, "2008": 7, "2009": 14, "2010": 11, "2011": 6, "2012": 11, "2013": 9, "2014": 11, "2015": 13, "2016": 14, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 13, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 15, "2023": 8}}
