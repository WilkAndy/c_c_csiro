An article by A. D. Atkinson, published in the Notes and Records in 1953 (1), treats Samuel Johnson\u2019s relations with science, scientists, and the Royal Society. Atkinson notes among the illustrative quotations in Johnson\u2019s Dictionary various allusions to the Royal Society, and also quotations from the Philosophical Transactions and from books closely touching on the Society, such as Nehemiah Grew\u2019s Musaeum Regalis Societatis. Atkinson goes on to enumerate thirty-four Fellows (including four Secretaries and two Presidents) within Johnson\u2019s acquaintanceship (2) and he concludes that Johnson \u2018would surely have enjoyed the honour of F.R.S. and been an adornment to the Society\u2019 (3). It seems, however, that Johnson\u2019s attitude to science was more subtle and more profound \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7472652335650494223", "cites_id": ["7472652335650494223"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsnr.1975.0015", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D9dwHLUxtGcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
