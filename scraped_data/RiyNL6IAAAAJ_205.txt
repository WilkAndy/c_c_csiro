A recent one is a fictitious diary of Elizabeth Pepys, wife of Samuel Pepys (F.R.S. 1665, P.R.S. 1684-86). There are clues aplenty that it is a hoax, but one fears that many feminist enthusiasts will suppose the diary authentic; and, indeed, there is evidence that professional librarians are being deceived. The picture of Pepys which emerges has no redeeming features: he is jealous and evil-tempered; in money matters he is miserly to his wife, but spendthrift on himself; he chases after whores and practices rape in marriage, bestowing on his young wife at least the symptoms of syphilis; he is shy of soap and water, and disgusting in his toilet habits; he is a glutton and comes home nightly vomiting drunk. A comprehensive demonstration that the \u2018diary\u2019 is a wicked calumny on a President of the Royal Society would not be difficult; but here we pursue just one matter \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16030246562623889734", "cites_id": ["16030246562623889734"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsnr.1994.0001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RqEfG1Hgdt4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
