The authors are seemingly unaware of the extensive literature on this topic, which anticipates their general conclusions, apart from their somewhat obscurely worded claim of linear dependence of the entry flux into the cavity on the excess of downward seepage velocity over its critical value. Unpublished work (see paragraph 4 below) indicates, on the other hand, that the dependence is complicated and inherently nonlinear. Presentation of the general physical principles involved and descriptions of the results of analysis go back to Philip (1986a, b, 1987a, 1988a, b). Later general reviews have been given by Philip (1989c, 1990c) and Ford et al.(1989). Philip et al.(1989a, b), Philip (1989b) and Knight et al.(1989) explained in detail the general problems \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12310898812009634900", "cites_id": ["12310898812009634900"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002216949290140Q", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VNycWz4Z2aoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
