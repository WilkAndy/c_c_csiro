(1988) studied constant rainfall infiltration into bounded profiles and, in particular, the dependence on profile depth Z* of Rcrit/K1. K1 is saturated hydraulic conductivity and Rcrit is the critical rainfall rate for which surface ponding and profile base saturation occur simultaneously. They found for the linear soil that for limz* \u21920 Rcrit/K1 \u2248 2.004. The correct value is in fact exactly 2. In the present work a shallow profile flow equation is established and used (1) to prove this result holds exactly for soils with moisture diffusivity D and hydraulic conductivity K quasi\u2010linearly connected but otherwise arbitrary functions of volumetric moisture content \u03b8; and (2) to develop a physical argument indicating the result is exact in the fully general case with D(\u03b8) and K(\u03b8) unconnected."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4530053756411844538", "cites_id": ["4530053756411844538"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91WR02199", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uhda5OP73T4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
