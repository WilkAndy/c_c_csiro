Up to this point the analysis has assumed that the depth of water over the soil is zero, or, at least, negligibly small. The present paper extends the analysis to the case where the depth is non-zero and so enables the effect of water depth on infiltration to be studied in some detail.Early empirical studies of the water depth effect, directed in the main towards evaluating field techniques of measuring infiltration rates or studying infiltration during irrigation, were most concerned with water depths in the range 0 to 20 cm. They suggested that the depth effect was small (4). Recent developments in \u201cwater spreading\u201d(cf. 6) extended the upper range of water depths of practical importance to 100 cm. or more; research in this connection suggests that depth effects may be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16799004828003947685", "cites_id": ["16799004828003947685"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1958/05000/The_Theory_of_Infiltration__6_Effect_of_Water.8.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pVQ_2eINIukJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 3, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 6, "1989": 4, "1990": 5, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 3, "1995": 7, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 3, "2007": 6, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 7, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
