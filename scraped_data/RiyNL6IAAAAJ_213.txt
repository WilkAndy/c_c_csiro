An important motivation is that the work promises to furnish new insights into various elements of the mechanics of heavy clay soils. We have in mind aspects such as: the state of stress of the water in heavy clay soils; stress tensors and stress trajectories on both microscopic and macroscopic scales; one-dimensional, three-dimensional, and other modes of soil volume change and deformation; the energetics of soil cracking.Although a heavy clay soil is not simply a dense colloidal suspension, the latter offers a more physically meaningful point of departure for the study of the mechanics of such soils than does the classical elastic body, which is the (albeit now remote) starting point of conventional soil mechanics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17404714131204119087", "cites_id": ["17404714131204119087"], "pub_url": "http://content.alterra.wur.nl/Internet/webdocs/ilri-publicaties/publicaties/Pub37/pub37-h2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:L5qkx0n3ifEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
