The analysis, and the basic methods of solution, hold for any given relation between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4666333065224606651", "cites_id": ["4666333065224606651"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.437186", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u1NfFDMlwkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
