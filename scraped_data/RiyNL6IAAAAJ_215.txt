This paper establishes the result that the potential due to an infinitely long polygonal homogeneous solid prism, at position r in the plane of its right section, is \u2013 . Here \u03c1i = \u2223 r \u2212 ri \u2223, where the ri are the position vectors of the n vertices of the polygon, and \u03b8ij are the angles r \u2212 ri makes with the two sides of the polygon which meet at vertex ri. The g's are exact functions of \u03b8ij. They are, in general, integrals of associated Legendre functions, but they are elementary for \u03b5 an even integer. A similar result holds for the potential within an infinitely long polygonal prismatic cavity. The analysis involves a systematic superposition schema and the concept of a supplementary potential with datum within the solid at infinity. The cases \u03b5 = 6 and \u03b5 = 4 are treated in detail and illustrative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17387266086055957759", "cites_id": ["17387266086055957759"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anziam-journal/article/inverse-power-law-potentials-about-polygonal-prisms-and-in-polygonal-cavities/164AFE8107FFA1CCA045F890C7B61BDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_9SPMmL6S_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1977": 1, "1978": 1, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
