The variation of this ratio in transient systems embodies the total physical influence of dead-end pores on diffusion. If this ratio were not to vary, the experimental detection of dead-end pores by diffusion studies would be impossible; and dead-end porosity per se would be of neither theoretical nor practical interest in diffusion studies. It would be simply one more geometrical factor influencing\" tortuosity\". It is therefore surprising that Jackson and Klute (1) have proposed an analysis which claims to estimate dead-end pore volume, but which relies on the assumption that this ratio is a constant, k. Furthermore, they adopt a value of k which implies that there is no local concentration difference (and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12442487315808453805", "cites_id": ["12442487315808453805"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1967.03615995003100050031x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rQQRZUqYrKwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1968": 1, "1969": 0, "1970": 0, "1971": 1, "1972": 1, "1973": 0, "1974": 0, "1975": 0, "1976": 0, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 0, "1980": 0, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 0, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
