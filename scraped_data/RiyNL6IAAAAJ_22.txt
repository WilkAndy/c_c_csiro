In this first paper of a series, the general properties of F ([theta]) are established for various phenomena: one-dimensional sorption and infiltration with constant concentration conditions and one-dimensional sorption (for the'linear'soil only) with constant and variable flux and variable concentration conditions. These studies provide a guide to the properties of F ([theta]) in more complicated phenomena in one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 200, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1346208823429861554", "cites_id": ["1346208823429861554"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1973/11000/ON_SOLVING_THE_UNSATURATED_FLOW_EQUATION__1__THE.2.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:spAI2sqxrhIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 4, "1985": 6, "1986": 9, "1987": 7, "1988": 7, "1989": 5, "1990": 11, "1991": 6, "1992": 4, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 11, "1997": 3, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
