Analyses of internal boundary layers produced by a step change in surface concentration of a scalar with and without WD confirm that the effect of WD is indeed negligible. The analysis with WD is, however, needed if an estimate of upwind diffusive flux is required."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13305912083877265082", "cites_id": ["13305912083877265082"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/36/7/1520-0450_1997_036_0974_wd_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uv4U5IoYqLgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
