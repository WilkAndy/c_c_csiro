In Philip (1973), one of us introduced the flux-concentration relation F (Q), where F is the normalized flux density and 0 is the normalized moisture concentration. Both there and in companion papers (Knight and Philip, 1973; Philip and Knight, 1974) the fact that F (&) is, in general, timedependent was explicitly recognized and demonstrated. Why do Boulier et al.(1987) assert that the usage flux-concentration relation\" is incorrect in general, and F should be called the flux-time-concentration relation^\" Consider, for example, the evolution of moisture profiles during infiltration. Everyone knows that the moisture profile changes with time, and that it is useful and fruitful to examine the evolution of the profile in time. Yet everyone is content with the usage moisture profile, we feel no obligation to mangle English and insist on introducing some tongue"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:naSTrk-c4S8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13573106481362099624", "cites_id": ["13573106481362099624"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1988.03615995005200050061x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qN0jcG5cXbwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
