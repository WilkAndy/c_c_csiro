The solution uses the assumption that, at some distance below the slope crest, a spatial equilibrium is approached with the moisture content (and other properties) independent of downslope coordinate x* and dependent only on the normal coordinate z* and time t. The analysis is found to be generally applicable beyond a small distance from the slope crest (or from a point of slope change). For slope angles less than 30\u00b0, infiltration normal to the slope differs relatively little from infiltration from a horizontal surface. Interesting aspects of the solution include a time\u2010independent total horizontal flow into the slope and a time\u2010dependent downslope total flow component which behaves as t1/2 at small t \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9363321229485398701", "cites_id": ["9363321229485398701"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/90WR01704", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rdpZmQwz8YEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 3, "1992": 5, "1993": 9, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 6, "2007": 5, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 12, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 10, "2018": 12, "2019": 6, "2020": 9, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
