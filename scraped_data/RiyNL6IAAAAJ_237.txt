The solutions for the loss give, at large times, power-law decrease to zero of slug central concentration and logarithmic increase of slug semi-width. Those for gain give concentration decreasing initially, going through a minimum, and then increasing, with blow-up to infinite concentration in finite time. Slug semi-width increases with time to a finite maximum in finite time at a blow-up. Taken in conjunction with previous studies, these new results provide an overall schema for instantaneous nonlinear diffusion point sources with nonlinear loss or gain for the total range n \u2265 0. Six distinct regimes of behaviour of slug semi-width and concentration are identified, depending on the range of n, 0 \u2264 n < 1, n = 1, or n > 1. Three of them are for loss, and three for gain \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:PoWvk5oyLR8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17442079153565607019", "cites_id": ["17442079153565607019"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anziam-journal/article/instantaneous-point-source-solutions-in-nonlinear-diffusion-with-nonlinear-loss-or-gain/480DDB2A49FD220CC63C274910E78409", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aySG_JO2DvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1}}
