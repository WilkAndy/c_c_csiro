Nevertheless, convection-diffusion with loss at the wall (0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1) is often modelled in geophysical and chemical engineering contexts by superposing on macroscopic Taylor dispersion a macroscopic loss term taken as a function of mean concentration. We test this procedure by finding, for flow in narrow channels, stationary solutions of the microscopic convection-diffusion equation that satisfy the wall condition 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1. The ratio of the longitudinal length scale of deposition predicted by the macroscopic model to that given by the microscopic analysis is 0.85 for \u03b1 = 0, decreasing monotonically to zero as \u03b1 increases toward 1. The divergence of the two results as \u03b1 \u2192 1 indicates the singular place occupied by Taylor dispersion in the full deposition-dispersion continuum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6472485950499976389", "cites_id": ["6472485950499976389"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000925099500109I", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xfRB5a3j0lkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
