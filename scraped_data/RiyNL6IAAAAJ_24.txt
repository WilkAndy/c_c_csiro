For the oblate spheroid with \u03b7 ( = length of minor axis/length of major axes) small, H = 1 \u2010 (\u03c0/2)\u03b7. It is argued that the equation should hold reasonably well for other meter shapes, and that, for thin meters, the relation H = 1 \u2010 \u03b1r, which yields f= 1/[1 \u2010 \u03b1r(l \u2010 \u2208 \u22121)], should be valid to a good approximation, \u03b1 is a constant and r is the ratio of mean meter thickness in the general direction of the heat flow to the square root of the mean cross section the meter presents normal to this direction. For the oblate spheroid \u03b1 = 1.70.
