Holes serve as obstacles to the flow, increasing water pressure at the hole surface. When the seepage is fast enough and/or the hole is large enough, water pressure exceeds soil air pressure and water enters the hole. Cavity shape is important also. Applications include the design of tunnels and underground repositories (e.g. for nuclear wastes) against entry of seepage water and the hydrology of soil macropores."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8316770186466949154", "cites_id": ["8316770186466949154"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/informit.483823138903586", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ivjromsaa3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
