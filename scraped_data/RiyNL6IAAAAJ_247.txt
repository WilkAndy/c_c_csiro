As one of the essentials for self-reproducing life, it is a substance of supreme importance to humankind, for survival, for the environment and for the economy (Kuenen, 1955). In its pure form as' distilled water', water is colorless, odorless and tasteles. This oxide of hydrogen (H20) freezes at ooc and boils at 100 C (at standard atmospheric pressure). It has a high specific heat, is a poor conductor of electricity and is very slightly compressible. Its maximum density is reached at 4 C, so that in natural environments such as lakes, ice forms at the surface while the bottomwater often remains warm (for encyclopedia citations with references, see Fairbridge, 1966, 1967b, 1972). Water in one form or another is probably present in every planet except Mercury and in many of their \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5063402425992637014", "cites_id": ["5063402425992637014"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-4020-4497-7_244.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Vmok7K3RREYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
