First, as I show in section 2, the relation between the complicated study of Parlange et al.[1985], on which the comment depends, and my simple Green and Ampt [1911] analysis of falling head infiltration [Philip, 1992a] is at best opaque.It is thus not surprising that Parlange et al. failed to identify the remarkable result that the dynamics of Green-Ampt falling head ponded infiltration takes the same functional form as that for a constant head [Philip, 1992a]. Barry et al.[this issue] have, however, discovered it in the work by Polubarinova-Kochina [1962], where it seems to have lain unnoticed hitherto. For my part, I have found an unpublished report by GJ Weir and W. M. Kissling (DSIR Applied Mathematics Group, 1991) recording this result a few months before I recognized it. It is of some interest that my note has led naturally to simple \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4748798593721531360", "cites_id": ["4748798593721531360"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94WR02566", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4HulKCkf50EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
