A bulb\u2010shaped region of saturated soil, the \u201csaturated bulb,\u201d adjoins the water\u2010filled length of the hole. The problem is solved by matching approximate models of the \u201cinner\u201d saturated flow within the bulb and of the \u201couter\u201d flow in the surrounding unsaturated soil. The quasilinear analysis, with sorptive number \u03b1 characterizing the capillary properties of the soil, is applied to the outer, unsaturated flow. Certain approximations made are geometrical, and others simplify the physics by treating gravity and capillarity as separable. The results agree well with the limited body of relevant detailed numerical solutions, and the model is consistent also with saturated flow results and formulae. In general, the capillary properties of the soil cannot be ignored: for a borehole of radius 0.05 m, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 183, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14368724389186754090", "cites_id": ["14368724389186754090"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR021i007p01025", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ktb3BLT2Z8cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 6, "1987": 8, "1988": 8, "1989": 8, "1990": 8, "1991": 2, "1992": 7, "1993": 10, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 6, "1997": 6, "1998": 3, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 6, "2007": 3, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
