Physical Processes, Measurements and Interpretations", "abstract": "The atmospheric heat engines of Earth and Mars are compared. Although water latent heat transfer drives the circulation of the Earth's atmosphere, particularly in the tropics, its contribution to the circulation of the martian atmosphere is negligible. The working fluid on Mars is CO2, which exerts its greatest influence on atmospheric circulation at the poles. The diurnal and seasonal flux of water within the martian regolith is also examined. Calculations indicate that, for a mean annual temperature of 200 K, a diurnal and annual temperature variation of 30 K will drive a maximum exchange of 1.2 pr micrometer and 120 pr micrometer of water, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11190231239156279514", "cites_id": ["11190231239156279514"], "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19890016438", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2qhjDAawS5sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
