The  are , their sign fixed by repetition of the\u2019template\u2019[j] of finite length 2p.[j] constitutes a difference scheme of\u2019differential order\u2019D, which can be determined. The principal theorem is that  is\u2019 partially convergent\u2019if and only if  is bounded. A series is partially convergent when the limit as  of the sum of 2pM terms exists. For [j]\u2019pure\u2019, the improved Euler-Maclaurin expansion (IEM) gives the compact representation\\begin {equation}\\tag {A} S^{(p)}\\sim-\\frac {\\mu (D)}{2p}\\sum _ {r= 0}^\\infty (2p)^{2r}\\frac {B_ {2r}(1/2)}{(2r!)} f^{(2r+ D-1)}(\\theta _r),\\quad 1-p\\leqslant\\theta _r\\leqslant p.\\end {equation}  is the sum,  is the Dth\u2019template moment\u2019, and the  are Bernoulli numbers. Efficient means for practical summation of these series follow also from IEM.
