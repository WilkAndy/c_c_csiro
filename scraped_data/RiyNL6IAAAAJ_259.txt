Seminar on Pollution and Water Resources", "volume": "6", "abstract": "My aim in this talk is to review for you the body of work relevant to hydrology which has been carried out in our laboratory. This work covers a time-span of 23 years. The present team includes about ten scientists, and the average complement over the 23-year period has been, perhaps, six or seven. During this time we have published well over 300 papers,* of which at least 200 have implications for hydrology. Obviously I can do no more here than attempt to convey something of the philosophy and the flavor of the work, and to identify in a broad way those lines which seem to me to have been the most important ones.I must, at the outset, emphasize that our laboratory was not set up to work specifically on hydrology. We began in 1952 as the Agricultural Physics Section of the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry.(CSIRO stands for Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and is the Australian Government institution for scientific research: the closest thing to it in North America is--or, at least, was--the National Research Council of Canada.) Consistent with the general philosophy of research administration in CSIRO, the terms of reference of our Agricultural Physics Section were quite broad: the application of mathematical and physical approaches and techniques to research problems in agriculture and plant biology. I am convinced that the fruitfulness of our work has depended quite centrally on the freedom we have had within CSIRO."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8813994949962028878", "cites_id": ["8813994949962028878"], "pub_url": "https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/41189/PDF/1/#page=116", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TteSXLWZUXoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1}}
