The preceeding treatment may beapplied to more general problems in the dynamics of the classical cell osmometer. No now principles are involved in such generalizations.\" OSMOSIS\" IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFUSIBLE SOL-uTE: The propriety of the term\" osmosis\" is open to question if the solute is diffusible. Strictly, the process is one of dialysis. Just as in the ideal osmometer, a diffusion pressure (14, 1) difference is set up across the membrane. In the ideal case, net movement of solvent across the membrane may be prevented by applying a constant hydrostatic pressure difference. In the present case, however,\" osmotic\" equilibrium would require that the applied pressure difference vary in accord with changes in concentration produced by diffusionof \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 182, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5393212953491106332", "cites_id": ["5393212953491106332"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC541079/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HGrfUpuK2EoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 2, "1986": 3, "1987": 1, "1988": 3, "1989": 3, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 5, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
