The paper provides an introduction to the practical implications and physical basis of local advection, but it is mainly devoted to developing methods of analysis to be applied in later papers. The treatment aims to provide simple and rapid numerical procedures for the solution of advection problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 177, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4652851918288192757", "cites_id": ["4652851918288192757"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/16/5/1520-0469_1959_016_0535_ttolai_2_0_co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9QQQ9ipAkkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 1, "1994": 9, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 5, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
