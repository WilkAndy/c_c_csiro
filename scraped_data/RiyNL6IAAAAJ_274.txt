A check reveals that an error of transcription led to incorrect evaluation of the function g (\u2022). Accordingly, Figures 2a and 2b of the paper should be replaced by the corrected Figure 2 shown here. The error also affected Figure 4 of the paper, which should be replaced by the corrected Figure 4 given here. In addition, the entry 3.8 x 105 for t, a in Table 1 should be corrected to5. 5 x 105. These various amendments do not affect the conclusions of the paper. to 0.1-2 t. grav t. geom"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7185480503532009370", "cites_id": ["7185480503532009370"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR023i008p01710", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mjeFmXL0t2MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1}}
