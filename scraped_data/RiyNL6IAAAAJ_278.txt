This 7\", is an order of magnitude closer to the experimental angular momentum relaxation time but is still afactor of three too small. This 7 w value also yields more physically reasonable values for the packing fraction and roughness. For a perfectly rough sphere of diameter 5. 05 A, the corresponding packing fraction is 0.68. The paper should conclude that Chandler's rough sphere rotational diffusion model gives a reasonable explanation of the motion of liquid methyl iodide.3.0 r---------------------------."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14652880078219406272", "cites_id": ["14652880078219406272"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.435451", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wGuq_st8WcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1979": 1}}
