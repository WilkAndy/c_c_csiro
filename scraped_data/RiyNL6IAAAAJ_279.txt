A peculiarity of the topic is that it arises in so many branches of natural science and technology: a few years ago I enumerated 22 such contexts and doubtless the list can be ext, ended. An irritating consequence is the, all too frequent, persistence within a particular field of a determined and contented ignorance of the literature and established concepts of the other fields. A partial remedy is to relate the topic to its primary bases in natural science: and, among these, fluid mechanics must loom largest. The conventional scale of discourse in fluid mechanics is, of course, the continuum (or Navier-Stokes) scale. A different scale of discourse, the macroscopic (or Darcy) scale, dominates porous-medium applications: discourse on this scale deals with physical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10351824624627109544", "cites_id": ["10351824624627109544"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/dynamics-of-fluids-in-porous-media-by-jacob-bear-elsevier-1972-764-pp-dfk-9400-fundamentals-of-transport-phenomena-in-porous-media-elsevier-1972-392-pp-dfl-6500-differential-equations-of-hydraulic-transients-dispersion-and-ground-water-flow-by-wenhsiung-li-prenticehall-1972-316-pp-895/E8AAB08708A55D451C600A86AC144A53", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qE4KWKYRqY8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1}}
