It has affinities with Parlange's method, but offers the following advantages: freedom to choose an initial assumed flux-concentration relation, F1, greatly improves the possible accuracy of the first approximation, and the higher approximations preserve integral continuity and therefore behave more stably. The first of these advantages is of practical importance, but the second is more basic. This paper treats only solutions subject to concentration conditions; the related technique for solutions subject to flux conditions will be developed in a later paper. The technique is studied analytically and numerically for one-dimensional sorption subject to constant concentration conditions. It is found to be convergent for a wide range of shapes of the diffusivity function. For the unfavorable case of the \u2018linear\u2019soil, the mean error is 3 percent after \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18017850822726720272", "cites_id": ["18017850822726720272"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1974/01000/on_Solving_the_Unsaturated_Flow_Equation__3__New.1.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EBubUNxDDPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 4, "1985": 2, "1986": 4, "1987": 7, "1988": 7, "1989": 5, "1990": 10, "1991": 3, "1992": 0, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 5, "1999": 2, "2000": 8, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
