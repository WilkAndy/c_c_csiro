Gathered together here are scientists from 16 countries and from a great diversity of disciplines from agronomy to molecular physics, from civil engineering to physiology and biochemistry, all concerned in one way or another with the common theme of the mechanics of swelling. We owe this unusual and valuable event to the imagination, tenacity, and energy of one man, Professor Theodoros Karalis. He has created this Workshop virtually single-handed (though he tells me his charming wife Photini helped with some practical details). In November 1989 Professor Karalis wrote to tell me of his hopes of bringing his Workshop into being. I saw immediately the compelling logic behind his vision of a meeting bringing together research scientists from diverse disciplines, but united in their concern with problems of volume change. Much illumination may follow from examining both what swelling phenomena in these various fields have in common, and the ways in which they differ."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DeztCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:vmb2XUXfgksJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_d7DM5h-n5&sig=lT1W3mt6hFi9LouN6XKrxFKrQT4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vmb2XUXfgksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
