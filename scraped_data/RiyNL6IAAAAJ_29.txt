If distribution of the moisture content in the medium for any value of 6 is unique, K (6) must also be unique. When hysteresis occurs, the possibility that K (6) is no longer unique must be formally admitted, though one would expect the devia-tions from uniqueness to be small. In any case, this situation will not normally occur during infiltration, absorption or desorption [Corollary 2 of (16)], so the problem does not arise here.The possibility of the failure of Darcy's law in systems with rapidly changing potential gradients has recently been investigated by the author (17), but the analysis still requires extension to unsaturated media. Strictly speaking, there is certainly a small range of times, t= 0 to t= A, during which Darcy's law cannot hold during \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC", "num_citations": 167, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16779667473020479047", "cites_id": ["16779667473020479047"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1957/08000/THE_THEORY_OF_INFILTRATION__3__MOISTURE_PROFILES.8.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:R-aPCqpa3egJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 5, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 6, "1996": 2, "1997": 6, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 6, "2016": 0, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 4}}
