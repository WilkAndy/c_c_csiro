The question arises: Can we track a ship from such images? A primitive model of convection\u2013diffusion of particles from the moving ship to the condensation level, and of formation of the detectable ship track, is developed. The analysis takes account of various influences, such as ship and wind velocity vectors. It yields, inter alia, the dimensions of the ship track and its disposition relative to the ship. Plausible parameter values give results in the observed range. Tracking is achieved for the simplified problem, but a paucity of meteorological and other data causes practical difficulties."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:anf4URPfarAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/39/7/1520-0450_2000_039_1031_paotst_2.0.co_2.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kbzw7V2XbI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
