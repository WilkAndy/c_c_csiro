In the present paper we use the preceding work as the basis for a study of the available (generally empirical) algebraic infiltration equations. This study is facilitated if we first give some attention to a new physical property of porous media which enters the subsequent developments here and which we shall have occasion to use also in later papers of this series."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 1862, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12027121553703076556,11111966219207527753", "cites_id": ["12027121553703076556", "11111966219207527753"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1957/09000/The_Theory_of_Infiltration__4__Sorptivity_and.10.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zILqplTr6KYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 10, "1985": 18, "1986": 22, "1987": 14, "1988": 27, "1989": 26, "1990": 24, "1991": 31, "1992": 26, "1993": 25, "1994": 25, "1995": 26, "1996": 35, "1997": 24, "1998": 22, "1999": 27, "2000": 36, "2001": 36, "2002": 42, "2003": 31, "2004": 32, "2005": 45, "2006": 38, "2007": 35, "2008": 40, "2009": 58, "2010": 50, "2011": 62, "2012": 54, "2013": 53, "2014": 58, "2015": 54, "2016": 65, "2017": 78, "2018": 74, "2019": 88, "2020": 67, "2021": 68, "2022": 64, "2023": 28}}
