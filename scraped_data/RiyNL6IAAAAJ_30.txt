A symmetrical electrolyte is treated specifically, but the method applies also to nonsymmetrical ones. The analysis preserves the mathematical character of the exact problem and (as is shown by comparison with machine solutions) yields results with errors which are for most purposes negligibly small. The complete solution involves five separate cases depending on the value of , where  is the radial coordinate and  the electrostatic potential, both in dimensionless form. In two cases the singularity in  is at , and the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel solution is a uniformly valid, though quantitatively poor, approximation. In the other three cases the (physically relevant) singularity is away from the origin. Similar singular behavior would account for the limited \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 153, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1394231753327978202", "cites_id": ["1394231753327978202"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1673081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2iavh2ROWRMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 3, "1984": 3, "1985": 4, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 4, "1990": 6, "1991": 3, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 7, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 8, "2006": 3, "2007": 8, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
