Our molecular scale is precisely that called\" mass-point\" or\" microscopic\" in continuum mechanics (eg Truesdell and Noll, 1965; Sedov, 1971); and in that subdiscipline our microscopic scale is confusingly designated\" macroscopic\" or\" phenomenological\". Discourse on our macroscopic or phenomenological scale deals with physical quantities related to averages of analogous quantities on our microscopic scale, the averages being taken over a volume, or cross-section, large compared with that of the individual pores of porous media, or of individual cells of tissues, or large enough to contain many particles in colloid pastes and suspensions. A formal description of a suitable averaging process has been given, for example, by Zaslavsky (1968). The primary goal of porous medium studies is theory on this macroscopic scale: physical observations are most readily made on this scale, and the practical concern is with processes on this scale. Usually a full microscopic theory would be needlessly elaborate, even if it happened to be feasible. Of course microscopic studies are important in their own right: well-founded theory on this scale may part of Mechanics of swelling, edited by Theodoros K Karalis Appl Mech Rev vol 48, no 10, October 1995 guide us as to the form macroscopic theory may take, and as to the limits of its applicability.
