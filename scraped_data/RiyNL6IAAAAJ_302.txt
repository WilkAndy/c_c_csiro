This paper examines solutions of the convection-diffusion equation during steady radial flow in two and three dimensions with diffusivity proportional to P     n     , with P the Peclet number.  Exact instantaneous and continuous point source solutions for radial flow in two and three dimensions are established.  In general, finite difference methods are needed for arbitrary n.  Relevant instantaneous and continuous point source diffusion solutions are developed for radial two- and three-dimensional systems. These represent small-time solutions useful for initiating the finite difference solutions for convection-diffusion with arbitrary n."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-bdf7e417-bb4f-32d5-b6b9-3bb77b754e76", "cites_per_year": {}}
