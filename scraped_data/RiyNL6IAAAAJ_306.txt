My own experience and, I suppose disposition, leads me to concentrate here on what swelling processes across the board might have in common, and on their phenomenological characterization and analysis at an appropriate macroscopic scale. This review of swelling mechanics thus makes no claim to be encyclopaedic."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:wSy_KLzO7YEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17239008806958675758&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LjeaeixDPe8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
