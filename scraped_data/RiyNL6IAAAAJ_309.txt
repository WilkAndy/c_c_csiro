Twenty circular shafts of final diameter 5-23m were sunk using a combination of diaphragm walling and ground freezing, with minimum disturbance to local hydrology."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13208915579741776530&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
