The present paper reports an observational study of the variation in the meteorological elements with distance and height downwind of a pronounced discontinuity from dry to wet surface conditions. In particular the temperature and humidity fields were observed together with the changes in the radiative\u2010balance components and in the wind structure. It was found that temperature and humidity changes at a height of 5 cm within 16 m of the discontinuity were commonly as much as 5$C and 5 g m\u22123 respectively. Theoretical treatments of the problem are outlined, and a slight modification of Philip's (1959) analysis is used to compare observed and predicted changes in temperature and humidity with distance downwind up to a height of 150 cm. It is found that the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15152003214793954328,7109280637414432106", "cites_id": ["15152003214793954328", "7109280637414432106"], "pub_url": "https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.49708938207", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GNReJaW6RtIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 3, "1982": 1, "1983": 5, "1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 1, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 8, "1995": 3, "1996": 9, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2}}
