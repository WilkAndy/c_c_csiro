P239-246 Fluid mechanics is applied to the study of solute transfer in fracture networks and shows that errors of proportional rout-ing of streamlines through discontinuous fracture junctions (after Hull and Koslow) may be unacceptably large when the 2 inlet discharges and the 2 outlet discharges both differ greatly in magnitude. Solutions are derived for arbitrary discharge patterns through four-way coplanar junctions: exact solutions for Laplace flows and approximate solutions for Stokes flows. The present analysis may be extended to junctions of fractures of different widths with different numbers of branches and different angles of intersection. 885135 Device for in situ measurement of hydraulic conductivity Torstensson, BA; Petsonk, AM Pro4th International Geoteclmlcal Seminar, Field Instrumentation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:5MTHONV0fEkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=64345353007977778&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
