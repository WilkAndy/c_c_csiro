Specific topics include: the joining problem in one-dimensional infiltration; the utility of the Burgers or Knight soil in one-dimensional flow; the importance of the Broadbridge-White soil in constant-flux one-dimensional infiltration; Broadbridge's result on the nonexistence of linearizing transformations of Burgers' equation in two dimensions (which probably carries to three); the power of the flux-concentration method; the wide applicability of the quasilinear analysis of multidimensional steady flows, much enhanced by the scattering analogue; and quasilinear results on the watertightness or otherwise to downward unsaturated seepage of macropores, holes, tunnels, and underground cavities. over"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14917367235070700506&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2qtw9nYiBc8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
