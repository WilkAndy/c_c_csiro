I have a horrid suspicion that I may be seen here as some kind of walking and talking historical relic, rather than (dare one say it?) as a purveyor of the latest news from the frontiers. Most of this script has been composed from my, possibly biased, viewpoint that I am not a historical relic; but before we go on to examine some recent and current developments, let me first explain to you how, in a sense, my links with infiltration go back not just a mere 30 years, but more than 70 years."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:wUn16MOA3RoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3092179894119887731&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c_OeCjuh6SoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
