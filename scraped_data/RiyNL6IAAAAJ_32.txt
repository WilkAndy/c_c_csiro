The paper deals primarily with the solution of (0) and the interdependence of x(t) and y(t). The results are of relevance to other methods of surface irrigation. (0) is valid only if x is a monotonic increasing function of t. Sufficient conditions are y \u2265 0, dy/dt \u2265 0, d2y/dt2 \u2264 0. Normally, the physical restrictions on y are such that these conditions are realized and (0) is valid. The general solution of (0), \u2018the infiltration\u2010advance problem\u2019 is found by means of the Faltung theorem of the Laplace transformation. The solutions of (0) for the various common forms of y follow readily. The \u2018Horton\u2019 solutions had been found previously by other methods. The new particular solutions are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8674495254194842909", "cites_id": ["8674495254194842909"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ069i004p00621", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HW0YaHn_YXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 4, "1988": 4, "1989": 3, "1990": 5, "1991": 4, "1992": 3, "1993": 4, "1994": 5, "1995": 3, "1996": 6, "1997": 6, "1998": 0, "1999": 5, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
