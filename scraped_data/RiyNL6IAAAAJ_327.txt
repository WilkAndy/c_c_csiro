There are both hydrodynamic and statistical elements to the basis of Darcy's law. The hydrodynamic one is that the Napier-Stokes equation governing the flow of a viscous, incompressible, Newtonian fluid is linear in the limit of small Reynolds number. The statistical one is that, although it is not feasible to know details of the internal geometry of the medium and of the microscopic distribution of velocity and potential, local mean quantities such as U and\u2661 can be defined and exist (see Philip, 1968)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5020496912163840274&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EqF4hVdjrEUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
