The microhydrologist, often a person better at analysis than synthesis, has preferred to continue the analytic process. The macrohydrologist, who might be supposed to be not only more directly motivated, but also better fitted, to put the pieces together again, seems often in the posture of flatly denying that the pieces are there. But we must leave further con-sideration of this dilemma for our concluding discussion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:eI34FqJmdUoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1365638450312303929&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OdV6Yu-48xIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
