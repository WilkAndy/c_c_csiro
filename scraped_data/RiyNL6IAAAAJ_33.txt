The range is perhaps 10 to 60 cm. with the 25 cm. of the present example a fairly typical value. It would follow, then, from equation (7) that the upper and lower limits of the depth effect on sorptivity and the smalltime infiltration rate are about 5 per cent and 0.8 per cent per cm. of h, in comparison with the value of 2 per cent found for the Yolo light clay.APPROXIMATION FOR vERY LARGE h Another situation in which a simplified model of infiltration may be usefully considered is the case when h is large. In this case the unsaturated part of the moisture profile will be very steep and the approximation that it is infinitely steep may be reasonably made. This approximation leads immediately back to the infiltration model of (6)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 150, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11810447453136834840,9341796028936720540,7944828894149324458", "cites_id": ["11810447453136834840", "9341796028936720540", "7944828894149324458"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1958/06000/THE_THEORY_OF_INFILTRATION__7.7.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GFGjWmIj56MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 4, "1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 2, "1990": 8, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 4, "1994": 6, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 4, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 1, "2016": 4, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
