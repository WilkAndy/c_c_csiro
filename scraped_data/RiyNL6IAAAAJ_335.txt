The general partial differential equation (involving y and K) governing water motion (in liquid, vapour and adsorbed phases) in porous media is presented and its significance in the study of the problems of micorohydrology indicated. It is then applied to a number of physical proccesses of importance during the irrigation cycle.(a) Infiltration: The results of a comprehensive investigation of the mathematical physics of infiltration are summarized. The moisture profile during infiltration is computed, and the effects on infiltration of the initial moisture content and of the depth of water over the soil are evaluated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12880356394322799940&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RK0KyOU3wLIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
