I shall have very little to say about hydrological events on that scale", "pub_year": 1954, "citation": "World Meteorological Organization 92, 5, 1954", "author": "JR Philip", "journal": "World Meteorological Organization", "volume": "92", "pages": "5", "publisher": "Secretariat of the WMO", "abstract": "understanding of the processes of the hydrological cycle which involve the soil, the plant, and the lowest layers of the atmosphere. These events of infiltration, drainage, water uptake by plants, transpiration, and evaporation are microprocesses in the sense that they can be coherently studied as local small-scale processes taking place at, above, and under, a single small area of the ground surface. Scientifically, this offers very great advantages, since we can, with relatively modest resources, reach an understanding of the basic mechanisms of the phenomena.*In general, however, macrohydrologists do not seem to have shown much interest in studies of this type. The reason for this may be that little serious work has been done on the formidable problem of how best to use this understanding of the microprocesses on the macroscale of the river basin. The microhydrologist, often a person better at analysis than synthesis, has preferred to continue the analytic process. The macrohydrologist, who might be supposed to be not only more directly motivated, but also better fitted, to put the pieces together again, seems often in the posture of flatly denying that the pieces are there. But we must leave further consideration of this dilemma for our concluding discussion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:jlhcAiayVhoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8330166746934687462&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5jbQboWymnMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
