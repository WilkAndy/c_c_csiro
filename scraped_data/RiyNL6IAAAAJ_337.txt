The nature, scope, and impending gravity of this situation has been ably characterized by Dr. JJ Harrar, President of the Rockefeller Foundation. In a stimulating address during the symposium, Dr. Harrar identified the two principal approaches toward alleviating malnutrition as (i) increased food production per unit land area and (ii) population control. This symposium was concerned with the first approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/1969.physiologicalaspects", "cites_per_year": {}}
