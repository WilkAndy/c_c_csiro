The equilibrium condition that it is a surface of constant \u03a8 then yields the differential equation of the interface. Simple methods of solution are developed for two\u2010dimensional (spaces between parallel plates, wedge\u2010shaped pores, spaces between circular cylinders) and axisymmetrical (circular tubes, spaces between spheres) configurations. Illustrative examples are given for capillary condensation of water vapor ( relative humidity 0.70\u20130.98) at 300 K in the space between parallel plates; in wedge\u2010shaped pores with semiangles \u03c0/12, \u03c0/6, and \u03c0/4; and in circular tubes. We find values of \u2016\u03a8\u2016 between plates and in tubes which are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15312191071167337634", "cites_id": ["15312191071167337634"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.433814", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:olTW2abUf9QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 2, "1986": 0, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 7, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 14, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
