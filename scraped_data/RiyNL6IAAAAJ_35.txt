This is formally equivalent to the independent domain theory of Poulovassilis.The similarity hypothesis (implying, loosely, that the distribution of geometrical relationships between wetting and drying meniscus curvatures is independent of \u2018pore size\u2019) holds fairly well for Poulovassilis' experimental data. The corresponding h functions are found and the \u0192(\u03b1, \u03b2) are mapped.In general, the establishment of \u0192(\u03b1, \u03b2) is a laborious process. However, with (A), \u0192(\u03b1, \u03b2) may be found from only the (routinely observed) drying and wetting boundary curves. Equation A yields the integral equation where j and g are known from the boundary curves and \u03a80 is the minimum potential, h is the unknown function. Equation B is solved \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC", "num_citations": 147, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8104343756531663274", "cites_id": ["8104343756531663274"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ069i008p01553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qoG5ObVpeHAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 7, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 3, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 5}}
