Difficulties, however, frequently arise for areas of appreciable size in the field. Known and unknown heterogeneities, on many scales, may vitiate predictions based on theory for homogeneous, or very simple heterogeneous, systems. Two types of heterogeneity are distinguished, deterministic and stochastic. The first often demands an extension of established analyses and may involve important phenomena absent from the analogous homogeneous problem. Stochastic heterogeneity may involve many scales and is imperfectly known. The statistical properties may be stationary, but in more complicated cases, randomness may be embedded in (either known or unknown) systematic trends. Some aspects of unsaturated and generally unsteady flow in heterogeneous systems are reviewed: the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11548186922763509386", "cites_id": ["11548186922763509386"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR016i002p00443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:il4hQ9JmQ6AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 7, "1985": 4, "1986": 4, "1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 8, "1990": 5, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 5, "1997": 4, "1998": 9, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 8, "2002": 5, "2003": 3, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
