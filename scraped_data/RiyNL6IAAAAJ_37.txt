It is introduced through the special cases of the surface line and point sources. The first of these solutions is new and the present derivation of the second is much simpler and more direct than that available hitherto. These solutions hold also for steady infiltration from suitably\u2010shaped furrows and basins. Corollary to the general theorem, relations of the same type hold between the horizontal flux density components. Both the theorems and the special results apply also to processes such as diffusion in a uniform convective flow and sedimentation under gravity and Brownian motion."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 144, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17698216528585829499", "cites_id": ["17698216528585829499"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500060010x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eyxO4CmynPUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 3, "1985": 3, "1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 5, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 2, "1992": 6, "1993": 2, "1994": 3, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 4, "1998": 1, "1999": 4, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 5, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 6, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
