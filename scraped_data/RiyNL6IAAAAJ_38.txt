Matched in this way, the linearized equation offers insight into the time course of multidimensional infiltration. The Laplace transform reduces the equation and its governing conditions into forms similar to those for quasi\u2010linear steady flows. The problems of unsteady infiltration from buried spherical and cylindrical cavities are solved. In many cases the solutions are approximately reducible to the product of the steady solution and a function only of time and radial coordinate. Theorems show that approximate product solutions apply not only to these configurations but generally to multidimensional cavities of arbitrary shape.
