Despite the attention of many scientists in the last fifty years, it was only recently that the partial differential equation describing infiltration was formulated. The papers in this series present the first solutions of the equation and discuss the theory of infiltration in the light of these solutions. A brief prehminary report of this work, as well as an informal discussion of the role which the methods of mathematical physics might play in the development of an adequate conceptual basis for the study of the problems of mierohydrology, was previously published (16). The present paper (part 1 of the series) describes the development of the infiltration equation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 1751, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10695707933050338850,14547382925003974616", "cites_id": ["10695707933050338850", "14547382925003974616"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1957/05000/THE_THEORY_OF_INFILTRATION_1_THE_INFILTRATION.2.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Iv7KYrLJbpQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 11, "1985": 15, "1986": 21, "1987": 21, "1988": 23, "1989": 23, "1990": 11, "1991": 15, "1992": 20, "1993": 17, "1994": 23, "1995": 24, "1996": 23, "1997": 26, "1998": 36, "1999": 19, "2000": 22, "2001": 27, "2002": 37, "2003": 25, "2004": 30, "2005": 40, "2006": 44, "2007": 46, "2008": 41, "2009": 39, "2010": 57, "2011": 58, "2012": 50, "2013": 49, "2014": 41, "2015": 58, "2016": 60, "2017": 53, "2018": 80, "2019": 63, "2020": 79, "2021": 79, "2022": 65, "2023": 22}}
