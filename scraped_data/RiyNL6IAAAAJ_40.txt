The exact solutions which follow are, in general, implicit, but explicit solutions are found for the instantaneous source and for redistribution in the finite region. The source is necessarily distributed with concentrationb, in contrast to the classical point source. Redistribution solutions are explicit for all initial distributions which may be represented through truncated Fourier cosine expansions of 4 terms or less."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 123, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9531160712305199380", "cites_id": ["9531160712305199380"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02353364", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FEkcait8RYQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 4, "1990": 5, "1991": 3, "1992": 5, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 3, "1996": 2, "1997": 6, "1998": 5, "1999": 3, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
