It has been uncertain whether significant deviations from the predictions of the diffusion analysis occur as a consequence of local disequilibrium. The present paper develops the theory of absorption in aggregated media and so provides a means of studying this question. An aggregated medium is regarded as one made up of macroporosity, through which flow on the Darcy scale occurs, and microporosity, which is free to exchange water with the macroporosity. Absorption in such a medium is analysed with the aid of two extreme models of macropore flow, one a wet-front model and the other a linearized model (the mathematical details of which are developed elsewhere). The wet-front analysis leads to an integral equation that is solved by means of the Faltung theorem of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 115, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17249565821445842086", "cites_id": ["17249565821445842086"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9680001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pqT_9LjEYu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 4, "1991": 3, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 4, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 7, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 3, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 6}}
