In addition to the well-known moisture potential \u00d8 and the gravitational potential -z (z being the vertical ordinate, taken positive downward), the total potential \u00d4 includes a further component \u00d9, the overburden potential. It is shown that               \u00d9  =  de/d\u00e8 [P(Zo)  +  ?zzo]       (A) where e is the void ratio, 6 is the moisture ratio, P(zJ is the load (if any) at the surface z = z,, and y is the apparent wet specific gravity. The equilibrium condition that \u00d4 be constant in depth reduces to a first-order differential equation, the solutions of which represent equilibrium moisture profiles. The singular solution                \u00e8  =  \u00e8pt for all z > zo           (B) separates two distinct classes of non-singular solutions. \u00e8p, designated the pycnotatic point, is the moisture ratio at which \u00e3 assumes its maximum \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 112, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14543109783904670013", "cites_id": ["14543109783904670013"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9690099", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PVElt0uB08kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 2, "1987": 3, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 6, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
