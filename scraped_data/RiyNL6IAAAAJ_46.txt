The study is based on the quasi\u2010linear analysis of steady three\u2010dimensional unsaturated flow. The results are presented graphically. The mathematical analysis applies to all linear convection\u2010diffusion processes from continuous point sources in the appropriate infinite and seminfinite regions. In the soil water context a limitation is that travel velocities are based on a mean volumetric moisture content."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:Zh0EY9V9P6UC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16390436719775833868", "cites_id": ["16390436719775833868"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR020i007p00990", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DN_BO1uHduMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 5, "2004": 0, "2005": 9, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 0, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
