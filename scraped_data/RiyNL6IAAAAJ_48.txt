The initial soil solutions were of relatively high salt concentration. It was found that both the water and salt concentration profiles preserved similarity in terms of distance divided by the square root of time. This observation implies that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is insensitive to pore water velocity and may be taken as a function of the volumetric water content only, at least for a given initial (low) moisture content.The formulation which follows is frankly phenomenological. It provides a simple means of predicting dispersion during flow in unsaturated soils which promises to be sufficiently accurate for most purposes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2377440554165295234", "cites_id": ["2377440554165295234"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1978.03615995004200020002x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gliheZZd_iAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 2, "1985": 3, "1986": 3, "1987": 2, "1988": 6, "1989": 6, "1990": 4, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 2, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 1, "2004": 3, "2005": 8, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
