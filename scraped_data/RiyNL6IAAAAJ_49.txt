The approach is necessarily a piecemeal one and does not lead readily to generalizations. This paper reports a first attempt at an alternative method of attack, in which we identify and explore subclasses of problems that are amenable to quasi-analytical methods of analysis. The work deals, specifically, with problems of absorption and desorption in one-dimensional heterogeneous media. The extension to one-dimensional infiltration is also indicated. We consider 'scale-heterogeneous' media, i.e, media in which the internal geometry is everywhere geometrically similar but in which the characteristic internal length scale is free to vary spatially.
