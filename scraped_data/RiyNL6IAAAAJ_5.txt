Most of the analysis is confined to steady conditions, but it definitely suggests that there are three phases to the desiccation of a given soil profile:             1. So long as the soil is sufficiently moist, the evaporation rate, E, is indistinguishable from that from a saturated surface, E             3             .                        2. At intermediate moisture contents, E is independent of E             3             and depends only on the soil-moisture distribution.                        3. When the surface layers of the soil are sufficiently dry, E is sensitive to the heat flux in the soil, and a negative correlation between E and E             3             may follow.           The first and second of these correspond to the well-known constant and falling rate phases of the \u201cisothermal\u201d drying of initially saturated \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 761, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7979279144271735885", "cites_id": ["7979279144271735885"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/14/4/1520-0469_1957_014_0354_eamahf_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Tez_DRsYvG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 14, "1985": 12, "1986": 5, "1987": 9, "1988": 12, "1989": 7, "1990": 13, "1991": 10, "1992": 10, "1993": 11, "1994": 12, "1995": 20, "1996": 8, "1997": 19, "1998": 17, "1999": 13, "2000": 17, "2001": 13, "2002": 18, "2003": 21, "2004": 22, "2005": 23, "2006": 10, "2007": 25, "2008": 15, "2009": 16, "2010": 21, "2011": 12, "2012": 21, "2013": 14, "2014": 13, "2015": 21, "2016": 20, "2017": 25, "2018": 17, "2019": 28, "2020": 23, "2021": 19, "2022": 17, "2023": 9}}
