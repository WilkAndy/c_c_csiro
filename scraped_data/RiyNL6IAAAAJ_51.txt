Water is suddenly introduced into the tube to standard depth, and the subsequent time course of water depth is observed. Soil\u2010water data in the Amazon basin has been secured with this instrument. We develop an approximate analysis based on a Green\u2010Ampt model, with the flow treated as a gravity\u2010perturbed spherically symmetrical pressure\u2010capillarity\u2010driven flow."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8310759233605498101", "cites_id": ["8310759233605498101"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/93WR01688", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9XTanH2_VXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 12, "2011": 10, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
