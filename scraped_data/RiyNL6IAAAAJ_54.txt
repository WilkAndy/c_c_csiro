The work deals specifically with the case where solution exchange with the paste column is possible only through its base. The extension to systems with 'top drainage' and 'double drainage' is trivial. The analysis combines Darcy's law applied to the flow of solution relative to the colloid particles with the continuity requirement. The hydraulic conductivity K and the moisture potential (i.e. minus the 'swelling pressure') \u00d8 are taken to be arbitrary known functions of the volumetric solution content \u00e8. The fundamental flow equation which follows is basically a nonlinear partial integrodifferential equation. It can be restated as a Fokker-Planck equation with \u00e8-dependent 'diffusivity' and the 'drift velocity' spatially constant but unknown and time \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 90, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1717194211791221106", "cites_id": ["1717194211791221106"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr9680249", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cjEsnAmz1BcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 3, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 2, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 4, "1993": 4, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 6, "2000": 4, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
