This article reviews the macroscopic mode of analysis which had its origins in problems of flow in porous media and which has been generalized and extended to apply to the behavior of colloidal suspensions. Applied to suspensions, the central concepts concern the energetics and hydrodynamics of the liquid phase.The approach leads to a non-linear Fokker-Planck equation, which reduces to a non-linear diffusion equation in some contexts. Simple experiments yield two functions characterizing the suspension. These functions express the dependence on particle volume fraction (or, equivalently, on \u03d1, the \u2018liquid ratio\u2019) of \u03c8, the relevant chemical potential of the liquid, and \u03ba, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11329324123714676077", "cites_id": ["11329324123714676077"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001868682800134", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:beVG40PYOZ0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 5, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 7, "1992": 5, "1993": 5, "1994": 7, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 3, "1998": 3, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 6, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
