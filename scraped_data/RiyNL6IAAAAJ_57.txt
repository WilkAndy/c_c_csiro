The concept depends on the primary resistance to diffusionresiding in the membrane or wall enclosing the cell. It is simply shown that, if such a cell is suddenly immersed in the solution, the concentration of solute inside the cell, 9, is given by the equation 0= 9o+(01-o)[1-exp (-KAt/V)](1) where 00 is the initial concentration of solute within the cell, 01 is the concentration in the external solu-tion, K8 is the permeability of the cell surface to the solute (cm sec-1), A is the area of the cell (cm2), V is the volume of the cell (cm3) and t isthe time (sec), with the origin of time at the instant of im-mersion of the cell in the solution. It follows that approach to the new equilibrium concentration withlin the cell is half \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 88, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6802739520848950595", "cites_id": ["6802739520848950595"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC541081/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q3W2P40vaF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 6, "1982": 1, "1983": 3, "1984": 2, "1985": 4, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 3, "1990": 1, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
