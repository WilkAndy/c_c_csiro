Flows were perturbed by suddenly changing G, the pressure gradient behind the wetting front, from a definite negative to a definite positive value. Three methods were used: (i) increasing air\u2010pressure ahead of the front, (ii) employing a nonwetting stratum, and, (iii) suddenly stopping liquid supply and preventing air\u2010entry. Glycerol and silicone, with contrasting properties, were used as the infiltrating liquids. The experiments confirmed the theory of Philip (1975a): immediately G was made positive, all flows became unstable, and the observed wavelengths of fingering agreed closely with those predicted by the theory.A modification of the theory to take account of the geometry of the microscopic air\u2010liquid interface predicts wavelengths in soil about twice as large as does the original theory.
