This involves a height-dependent apparent diffusivity and vertical profiles of (i) mean concentration in the air and (ii) mean concentration at foliage surfaces. The model enables an examination of the partition and dissipation of the net radiant energy absorbed by vegetation.             In the present study diffusive resistances to H             2             O transfer within the plant and the soil are neglected. However, numerical examples indicate that, even in this case, the downward transfer of sensible heat tends to make the distribution of the transpiration load within vegetation more even than that of absorbed net radiation. The source distribution for sensible heat is generally of quite different shape to that for latent heat, and the \u201cfoliage Bowen ratio\u201d systematically increases with height within the canopy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 87, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17618965757471889821", "cites_id": ["17618965757471889821"], "pub_url": "https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/3/4/1520-0450_1964_003_0390_satpit_2_0_co_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nRni0wEkg_QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 4, "1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
