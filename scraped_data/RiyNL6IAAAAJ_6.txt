Limits of time, tem\u043d perament, and competence would have led, of necessity, to a nonencyclo\u043d paedic article, even in the absence of a very welcome editorial exhoratation not to produce a\" synoptic summary of many papers.\" The customary foot\u043d note giving the date of completion of a literature survey is omitted since no specific survey has been undertaken. I have, in the main, limited references to relevant papers which have come my way. I do not regard myself as a physiologist, though I believe that the kind of physical commentary I aim to provide here is pertinent to the plant physiologist interested in plant water relations. In this article I shall be concerned mainly with the water relations of whole plants in the field."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 511, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9247627597987497152", "cites_id": ["9247627597987497152"], "pub_url": "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.pp.17.060166.001333", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wMQk6U0sVoAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 12, "1985": 3, "1986": 2, "1987": 4, "1988": 3, "1989": 5, "1990": 1, "1991": 5, "1992": 5, "1993": 7, "1994": 1, "1995": 5, "1996": 4, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 6, "2000": 6, "2001": 8, "2002": 11, "2003": 9, "2004": 9, "2005": 19, "2006": 8, "2007": 6, "2008": 12, "2009": 17, "2010": 21, "2011": 12, "2012": 27, "2013": 17, "2014": 19, "2015": 12, "2016": 17, "2017": 19, "2018": 18, "2019": 13, "2020": 11, "2021": 19, "2022": 25, "2023": 6}}
