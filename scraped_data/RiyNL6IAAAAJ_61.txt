The full equation is a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, and reduces to a diffusion equation when gravity may be neglected. Equations of the same form describe water movement and volume change in swelling soils. This paper reviews recent work on quasianalytical and analytical methods of solving these equations."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 86, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16824109301006621129", "cites_id": ["16824109301006621129"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1974/05000/Recent_Progress_in_the_Solution_of_Nonlinear.4.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yVnYdEU-e-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1980": 1, "1981": 1, "1982": 1, "1983": 0, "1984": 2, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 4, "1988": 4, "1989": 3, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 6, "1994": 3, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
