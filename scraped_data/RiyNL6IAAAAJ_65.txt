The void ratio, the hydraulic conductivity, and the moisture potential are taken to be arbitrary known functions of the volumetric moisture content \u00e8. Then the combination of Darcy's law, applied to water flow relative to the soil particles, and the continuity requirement yields the general flow equation for systems of this type. In terms of material coordinates, the equation takes a nonlinear heat-conduction form. For media exhibiting (a) zero and (b) normal volume change, the equation reduces, as it should, to two known equations: (a) the nonlinear diffusion equation in physical coordinates, and (b) the nonlinear diffusion equation in material coordinates. The specific problem is that of sorption consequent on a step-function \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=400756484958516884", "cites_id": ["400756484958516884"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr9690001", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lPZiV-bFjwUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 1, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 4, "1989": 0, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 5, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 4, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 3, "2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
