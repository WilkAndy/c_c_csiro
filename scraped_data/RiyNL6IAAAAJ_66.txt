Each pair had a common initial moisture content (0.04, 0.1, or 0.15), with one experiment involving displacement of concentrated soil solution by dilute solution and the other, vice versa.In all experiments, both the soil solution content and the salt concentration preserved similarity in terms of distance divided by square root of time. This confirmed earlier observations that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the conditions of these experiments is effectively independent of volume flux density. These results were found to be consistent with the studies of Saffman (1959) and Pfannkuch (1963) on transport during steady flow.The inferred dispersion coefficient is essentially independent also of the volumetric moisture content (at least in the range 0.18\u20130.28). It is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3628580498364645633", "cites_id": ["3628580498364645633"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1978.03615995004200040001x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AUHv-7xOWzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1981": 2, "1982": 1, "1983": 3, "1984": 4, "1985": 0, "1986": 5, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 6, "1997": 2, "1998": 2, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
