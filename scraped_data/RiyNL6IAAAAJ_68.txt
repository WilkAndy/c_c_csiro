We formulate and solve this problem. The key to its simplicity is its similarity character, with moisture profile x(\u03b8) proportional to t1/2. At the interface x = 0 there is, for t > 0, a permanent and constant moisture content jump \u03b83 to \u03b84 (\u03b83 > \u03b84). The operative moisture potential is the primary drying potential for x < 0, \u03b81 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2265 \u03b83 and the primary wetting potential for x > 0, \u03b84 \u2265 \u03b8 \u2265 \u03b82. The operative moisture diffusivity is the primary drying diffusivity for x < 0 and the primary wetting diffusivity for x > 0. The drying diffusivity is greater than the wetting diffusivity near \u03b8 = \u03b81 and less near \u03b8 = \u03b82 Solutions are found for illustrative examples corresponding to four values of H, the relative magnitude of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15601924933636164124", "cites_id": ["15601924933636164124"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91WR00780", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HIqxiRAshdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 5, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 5, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
