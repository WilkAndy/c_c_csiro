Study of the energy balance of drying bare soils indicates that the major errors of null\u2010point calorimetry are likely to arise from net evaporation in upper soil layers. A net evaporation rate of at least 1 mm/d probably occurred in the example used to introduce null\u2010alignment. This small evaporation rate changes the q profile so radically that null\u2010alignment may give \u03bb\u2010values averaging about 52% of the correct ones. Diurnal variations of latent heat sink strengths, null\u2010points, and temperature gradients, combine to produce diurnal variation of the error in null\u2010aligned \u03bb's, thereby explaining the reported diurnal variation of null\u2010aligned \u03bb. Since errors tend to be large and negative in daytime, and small and positive at \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13429344743559136556", "cites_id": ["13429344743559136556"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000010003x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LAUafuSdXroJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 3, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 3, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 7, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
