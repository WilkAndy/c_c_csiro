Solutions are presented numerically and graphically for values of the dimensionless cavity radius, R0, ranging from 0.01 to 10. The dependence on R0 of the average infiltration rate around the cavity surface, and of the distributions of moisture content and potential, are examined. As R0 increases, the effects of gravity on the phenomenon increasingly dominate those of capillarity. Gravity very strongly distorts the moisture distribution from the symmetry produced by capillarity alone: for R0 as small as 0.01, the depth of the effectively wetted region exceeds 250 times its horizontal width on the cavity center line; and the ratio increases rapidly with R0, exceeding 50 000 for R0 = 5. An earlier small R0 approximation proves useful only for R0 \u2264 0.2.
