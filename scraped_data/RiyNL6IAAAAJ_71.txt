Only where the radius of the contour is less than about 10 times the characteristic infiltration length lgrav (or 10 times the sorptive length) need the perturbation be taken into account. This result opens up a considerable extension of applicability of the analysis of infiltration on planar hillslopes to embrace slopes with curved contours, such as ridge noses and hollows."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4959821177301124406", "cites_id": ["4959821177301124406"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91WR00098", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NkV-HhXT1EQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 7, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
