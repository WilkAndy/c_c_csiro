Most of the problems recognised at that time remain with us today and, when they arise in individual cases, their solution is usually approached in an empirical way drawing little on the principles of natural science. Perhaps because of the failure of technologists to found their technology on a sound scientific basis, the science too has been slow to develop-thus in a sense seeming to justify its neglect by the technologist.
