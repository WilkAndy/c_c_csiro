The outermost box gives a brief general account of modem developments in the mathematical physics of unsaturated flow in soils and porous media. This provides the necessary foundations for the second box, which describes the quasi\u2010linear analysis of steady multidimensional unsaturated flow, which is an essential prerequisite to the analog. Only then can we proceed to the innermost box, devoted to our major theme. An exact analog exists between steady quasi\u2010linear flow in unsaturated soils and porous media and the scattering of plane pulses, and the analog carries over to the scattering of plane harmonic waves. Numerous established results, and powerful techniques such as Watson transforms, far\u2010field scattering functions, and optical theorems, become available for the solution and understanding of problems of multidimensional infiltration.
