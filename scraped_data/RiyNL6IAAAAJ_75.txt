Numerous established results, and powerful techniques such as the Watson transform, are thus available for the solution and understanding of problems of unsaturated flow. These are needed, in particular, to provide the asymptotics of the physically interesting and practically important limit of flows strongly dominated by gravity, with capillary effects weak but nonzero. This is the limit of large s, with s a characteristic length of the water supply surface normalized with respect to the sorptive length of the soil. These problems are singular in the sense that ignoring capillarity gives a totally incorrect picture of the wetted region. In terms of the optical analog, neglecting capillarity is equivalent to using geometrical optics \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 63, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16661683652645860136", "cites_id": ["16661683652645860136"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR021i012p01875", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KLPjMwExOucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 2, "1986": 5, "1987": 3, "1988": 4, "1989": 5, "1990": 4, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 2, "1997": 0, "1998": 3, "1999": 0, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 4, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
