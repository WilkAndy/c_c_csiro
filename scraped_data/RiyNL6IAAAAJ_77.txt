Solutions are presented numerically and graphically for values of the dimensionless cavity radius R0 in the range 0 to 10. The dependence on R0 of total cavity flow, of the variation of infiltration rate around the cavity surface, and of the distributions of moisture content and potential, are examined. As R0 increases, gravity increasingly distorts the moisture distribution from the symmetry produced by capillarity alone. This distortion, although marked, is less than one\u2010hundredth that for infiltration from circular cylindrical cavities: a vivid illustration of the stronger dominance of gravity over capillarity in two\u2010dimensional systems than in three\u2010dimensional ones. An earlier approximate solution of this problem proves accurate only for R0 \u2a7d 0.27.
