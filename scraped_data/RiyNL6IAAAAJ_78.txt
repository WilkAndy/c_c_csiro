Observations on such media yield, at best, apparent contact angles which cannot be related directly to contact angle at interfaces within the medium. In some circumstances scaling by apparent contact angle may hold approximately, but this is of only limited value, since apparent contact angle depends not only on the true liquid\u2010solid contact angle, but also on properties of the internal geometry of the medium. These matters are illustrated through the counter\u2010example of a (somewhat more realistic) conical\u2010pore model; and an interpretation is offered of some data of Mustafa et al. (4)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12697679292926757731", "cites_id": ["12697679292926757731"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500030048x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y4u7rgo4N7AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 2, "1988": 2, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
