R(t), the Lagrangian correlation function, may be found from the correlation function (x, r, t) based on the sub\u2010ensemble of ``Eulerian trials'' for which the fluid particle at (x, r, t) is the same as that at (0, 0, 0). The hypothesis that  may be substituted for  yields a connection between R(t) and (x, r, t). The Lagrangian time scale is found to be about one\u2010third the Eulerian time scale. The apparent Eulerian time scale depends on the intensity of turbulence. Data on the ratio of Lagrangian to apparent Eulerian time scales agree farily well with the analysis."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9152778168057080042", "cites_id": ["9152778168057080042"], "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1762507", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6ij-FkAzBX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 2, "1984": 1, "1985": 4, "1986": 3, "1987": 0, "1988": 3, "1989": 1, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
