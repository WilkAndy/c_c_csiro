Such a population will have made only an elementary advance in sociality over an otherwise similar population in which the individuals move in a random manner, but it will be shown that this advance will always enable the species to exploit its habitat more effectively and will in many situations make the difference between survival and extinction.To simplify the analysis developed here, it is assumed both for the non-random and the random populations that the difference between the birth and death rates is a linear function of population density, so that the non-random population is the classical logistic population of Verhulst-Pearl. Any other possible functional relationships between population density and birth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=92160117407081990", "cites_id": ["92160117407081990"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/1932132", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BuaBdCNrRwEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 4, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
