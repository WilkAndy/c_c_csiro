The analysis embraces concave and convex surfaces which are parts of the surfaces of circular cylinders and spheres. We thus model concave and convex slopes (of both ridges and isolated hills), valley bottoms and hollows, and ridgecrests and hillcrests. The major geometrical influence on the flow processes is the slope angle. Only when \u03c3\u22121 (\u03c3 = surface total curvature) is less than about 10 times the characteristic infiltration length lgrav (or 10 times the sorptive length) does the perturbation due to surface curvature need to be taken into account. Accordingly, the earlier analysis of infiltration on planar hillslopes has wide applicability to slopes with surface curvature."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6773421074253137731", "cites_id": ["6773421074253137731"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91WR00129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q8cAdZQGAF4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
