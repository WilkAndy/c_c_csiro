Interface configurations and isotherms are calculated for (a) adsorption only,(b) capillary condensation only, and (c) combined adsorption and capillary condensation, on a model rough surface. The adsorptive potential T is calculated by integration over the solid of the intermolecular potential, and the capillary potential C through Kelvin\u2019s equation. The interfaces for (c) are surfaces of constant 4>(='F+ C) and are found as solutions of the appropriate differential equation. For an illustrative example, capillary condensation influences the interface configurations, and the isotherm, over a wide range of relative vapor pressure; it more than doubles mean film thickness at the point of maximum augmentation, and its effect becomes negligible at film thicknesses \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16376354699873401277", "cites_id": ["16376354699873401277"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100501a012", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vbnAedV_ROMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 0, "1987": 2, "1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 5, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
