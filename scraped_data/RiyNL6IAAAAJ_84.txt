We use power-law representations of the vertical profiles of mean windspeed and eddy diffusivity, and exploit two known similarity solutions, one for a step-function change of surface concentration, and the other for a step-function change of surface flux density. To a very close approximation, these two contrasting canonical advective problems yield the same (spatially variable) boundary layer transfer coefficient expressing the ratio of the surface flux perturbation to the surface concentration perturbation. Adopting this coefficient reduces the (spatially variable) surface energy balance for the advective boundary layer with surface resistance to a quadratic equation, with the solution yielding the fetch distances x at which \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12751366062359351806", "cites_id": ["12751366062359351806"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00259475", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_pHmw9_z9bAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1988": 1, "1989": 1, "1990": 4, "1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 6, "1996": 4, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
