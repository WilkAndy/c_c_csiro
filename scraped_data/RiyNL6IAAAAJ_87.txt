His first approximation, which was developed by Macey (1959), satisfies continuity in the integral sense, but the second and higher approximations do not. Approximations beyond the first lack any constraining link between the separate steps of \u2018satisfying continuity\u2019and \u2018satisfying Darcy's law\u2019, which make up each iteration. There is, consequently, nothing in the procedure to ensure convergence. A detailed investigation establishes the nonconvergence of the method when applied to one-dimensional sorption. It is found that the first approximation is best, and that the higher approximations make oscillations of increasing magnitude about the exact solution. Two illustrative examples are given. There is no reason to expect the procedure to be any more useful in other cases. The utility of Parlange's method is thus simply the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15089416292376419854", "cites_id": ["15089416292376419854"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Abstract/1973/12000/on_Solving_the_Unsaturated_Flow_Equation__2_.3.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Dp4WtytgaNEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1978": 1, "1979": 1, "1980": 3, "1981": 0, "1982": 2, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
