This paper establishes the spatial distributions which are steady under the combined influence of birth, death, and one-dimensional dispersion, together with a general analysis of their stability. The distributions possible for a given growth function F (N)(F is population density growth rate at normalized density N) depend on whether\u222b 0 1 F d N\u22db 0 The principal ones of interest are spatially periodic (eg in a finite region with reflecting boundaries) or aperiodic (eg in a finite region with absorbing boundaries). The theory of stability to small disturbances is established with the aid of Sturm-Liouville comparison theorems.
