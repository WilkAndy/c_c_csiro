The value of P for water ranges from 80 cm. for soils of coarse texture to 140 cm. for clay (12). The depth of water over the soil is commonly only a few centimeters, so the effect on z of the water depth is small. Thus, for P= 100 cm., variation of H from 1 to 5 cm. produces only a 4 per cent change in z. Equation (8) implies that the infiltration rate is primarily dependent on i. This provides some formal justification for the technique of\" time-condensation,\" which hydrologiste (14) have developed (apparently intuitively) to enable the use of an infiltration equation derived for the case of continuous surplus water at the surface in the more general problem where water may \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 312, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14099673301197450340", "cites_id": ["14099673301197450340"], "pub_url": "https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1954/02000/AN_INFILTRATION_EQUATION_WITH_PHYSICAL.9.aspx", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZOzuBioarMMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 7, "1987": 3, "1988": 5, "1989": 0, "1990": 7, "1991": 1, "1992": 6, "1993": 7, "1994": 5, "1995": 9, "1996": 4, "1997": 8, "1998": 3, "1999": 7, "2000": 5, "2001": 5, "2002": 7, "2003": 6, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 8, "2012": 8, "2013": 11, "2014": 7, "2015": 4, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 5}}
