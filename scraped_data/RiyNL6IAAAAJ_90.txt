It enters into a general \nmethod of exact solution of the concentration-dependent diffusion equation. An account is \ngiven of the properties of this function, and of its derivatives and integrals. The function B(O) \n=(2/~) exp [\u2014(inverfc 0)2] is intimately connected with the first integral of inverfc 0 and with \nits derivatives. Tables of inverfe 0 and B(O) are given. I. INTRODUCTION The solution of one-dimensional \ndiffusion problems is usually sought in the form concentration = explicit function of distance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9204007892572921787", "cites_id": ["9204007892572921787"], "pub_url": "https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/record/seri/AuJPh/0013/1960AuJPh..13...13P.html", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u1-z0mk0u38J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1985": 1, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
