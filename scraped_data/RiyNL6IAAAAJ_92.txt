Both the quasi\u2010linear and the full nonlinear solutions are found exactly and simply. The identical general mathematical character of the two types of solution, and the good agreement of numerical details, attest to the reliability and utility of the (very much simpler) quasi\u2010linear analysis. A remarkable result is that for both the parabolic cylinder and the paraboloid, the potential at the cavity wall is spatially uniform. These geometries thus constitute separatices between apically blunter ones (circular cylinder, sphere), where the potential at the wall decreases downstream, and sharper ones (wedge, cone, hyperbolic cylinder, hyperboloid), where it increases. The parabolic geometries are optimal in leaking nowhere or everywhere: blunter ones leak first at the apex \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10873738688840402132", "cites_id": ["10873738688840402132"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR025i004p00605", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1ATB2LlH55YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 5, "1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
