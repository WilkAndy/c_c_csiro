The exact solutions for steady quasi\u2010linear point and line sources over a water table are our point of departure. With their aid we construct approximate solutions to the general problem of three\u2010dimensional axisymmetric and two\u2010dimensional steady infiltration from finite water supply sources at fixed moisture potential to a water table at finite depth. We take as illustrative solutions disc\u2010 and strip\u2010shaped water supply sources. When the depth from the source to the water table (or the base) is of order 4 sorptive lengths, perfect drainage solutions yield discharge estimates of ample accuracy. When the depth is less, our approximate analysis gives, in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15503379987231163491", "cites_id": ["15503379987231163491"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR025i001p00109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y0TQPPURJ9cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 1, "1990": 1, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 2, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 1, "2008": 7, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
