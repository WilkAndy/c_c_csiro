Exact solutions are given for constant and for piecewise constant rainfall. An inverse method yields solutions for arbitrary hyetographs. Ponding can increase markedly both the total duration of the infiltration event and the total amount infiltrated. The analysis suggests that capillary hysteresis emerges during the ponding recession phase toward the end of a storm. In long\u2010duration heavy rainstorms infiltration rate may increase with time, contrary to the classical picture. The asymptotic large time infiltration rate under continuous constant rainfall at rate R, with   (the conductivity parameter in the Green\u2010Ampt formulation) is an increasing function of both   and R. (With ponding neglected, it is simply  ).
