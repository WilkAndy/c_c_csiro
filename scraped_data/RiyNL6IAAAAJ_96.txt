Both exact solutions and simple asymptotic results are found. These are qualitatively similar to those given previously for circular cylindrical cavities, exhibiting such features as the dry shadow and the roof\u2010drip lobes. A major practical result of the analysis is the function \u2202max(s), the dependence of the maximum potential (at the roof apex) on the dimensionless quantitys = \u00bd \u03b1l, with \u03b1 the sorptive number and l cavity radius. \u2202max(s) is almost indistinguishable from \u2202max(\u00bds) for circular\u2010cylindrical cavities. This implies that physically the most relevant configuration parameter is total curvature at the apex of the cavity surface. Our results enable us to establish, for given values of downward seepage velocity, cavity radius, saturated hydraulic conductivity K1 and of \u03b1, whether \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14346325828600861913", "cites_id": ["14346325828600861913"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR025i001p00029", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2RTEvVRjGMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1989": 3, "1990": 6, "1991": 1, "1992": 2, "1993": 1, "1994": 1, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 4, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
