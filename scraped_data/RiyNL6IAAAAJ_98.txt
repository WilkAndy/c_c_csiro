We apply fluid mechanics to the problem and show that the errors of proportional routing may be unacceptably large when the two inlet discharges and the two outlet discharges both differ greatly in magnitude. In extreme cases one inlet flow is wholly excluded from one of the two outlets, and proportional routing is maximally incorrect. Solutions are established for arbitrary discharge patterns through four\u2010way coplanar junctions: exact solutions for Laplace flows (Hele\u2010Shaw flows and Darcy flows (fractures filled with porous material)) and approximate solutions for Stokes flows. The Laplace solutions apply also to a range of transport processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "RiyNL6IAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 45, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8429703894665621203", "cites_id": ["8429703894665621203"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR024i002p00239", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:025FmwdT_HQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 2, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 2, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 6, "2006": 4, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
