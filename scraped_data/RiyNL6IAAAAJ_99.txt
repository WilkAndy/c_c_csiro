This paper develops a critique of this approximation through calculations for various relevant configurations of the solid. The distance dependence of the intermolecular potential, h (\u03c1), may be inferred from the variation of adsorptive potential F with \u03bd, the film thickness on a single infinite plate, since h (\u03c1) =\u03c01/2(d/d\u03bd)(dF/d\u03bd2) \u2016\u03bd=\u03c1. Exact solutions of the adsorptive field are found for h an inverse power law, with special attention to the powers \u22126 and \u22124. The configurations investigated are (a) parallel plates, (b) tubes, (c) cylinders, (d) spherical cavities, (e) spheres, (f) wedge\u2010shaped pores, and (g) edges. The results are apparently all new, except for a special case of (a).
