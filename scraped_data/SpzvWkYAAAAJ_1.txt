They are listed here together with their type-data and subsequent records of geographical distribution, food-plants, parasites and predators. In addition, the food-plant genera are listed systematically by family with the associated whitefly species. Similarly, the natural enemies are presented in a systematic list, together with the host species of whitefly. The nomenclatural changes include 22 new specific synonyms, 8 new generic synonyms, 5 replacement names and 47 new combinations. Nomina nuda, fossil species and species excluded from the Aleyrodidae are listed separately. The British Museum (Natural History) collections of this group comprise 408 species in 79 genera, including the type material of 255 species. The type material held in other institutes is indicated where this has been verified."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC", "num_citations": 1005, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4288659999457158091", "cites_id": ["4288659999457158091"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19780557087", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yyMSFoxhhDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 5, "1985": 7, "1986": 9, "1987": 11, "1988": 10, "1989": 5, "1990": 7, "1991": 13, "1992": 12, "1993": 14, "1994": 19, "1995": 11, "1996": 16, "1997": 12, "1998": 10, "1999": 15, "2000": 22, "2001": 29, "2002": 27, "2003": 35, "2004": 24, "2005": 39, "2006": 40, "2007": 38, "2008": 38, "2009": 32, "2010": 32, "2011": 37, "2012": 32, "2013": 24, "2014": 36, "2015": 41, "2016": 42, "2017": 33, "2018": 30, "2019": 41, "2020": 40, "2021": 33, "2022": 31, "2023": 9}}
