This is done by glueing or sewing together two or more Acacia phyllodes, or by weaving a tentlike structure on a phyllode surface. These thrips then breed within the domiciles, sometimes for multiple generations. Mature females become dealate in seven of twelve species discussed, through fracture of the distal four\u2010fifths of each wing, although young females and all males have complete wings. Of these twelve species, six are placed in Dunatothrips Moulton and six in a new genus, Sartrithrips. Adults of the latter genus have a spinelike structure dorsal to the anus, \u2018the supra\u2010anal process\u2019, that is not found in any other member of Phlaeothripidae. Despite the many structural and biological character states shared by these twelve species, molecular methods using one nuclear gene (wingless) and one \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3515710780385269794", "cites_id": ["3515710780385269794"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.0307-6970.2001.00159.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ihjg5VNQyjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 10, "2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 5, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
