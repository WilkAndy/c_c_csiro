The possibility is discussed that the three North American species, hoodi, pallidus and sexmaculatus are colour variants of a single species. Three apparently Old World species, dilongicornis, longicornis and takahashii, cannot be distinguished satisfactorily. Three new synonyms are established: quadrinotata is a synonym of asura; hartwigi is a synonym of brevipilis; priesneri is a synonym of takahashii. Two species from the Canary Islands are considered nomina dubia: quadrimaculatus and lanzarotensis. Two species are here recorded for the first time from Australia, latipennis and rhagebianus, and Australian records of sexmaculatus are considered to be based on misidentifications."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:XUvXOeBm_78C", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17540711770972959074", "cites_id": ["17540711770972959074"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2797.1.4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YjFbyGsgbfMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 5, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 5}}
