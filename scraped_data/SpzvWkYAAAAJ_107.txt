We use this phylogeny to infer the evolutionary history of host\u2010plant affiliations, gall induction and other types of domicile use, and different forms of social behaviour. Maximum parsimony analysis yielded forty\u2010eight cladograms of length 316, and the strict consensus of these cladograms was well resolved. This phylogeny indicated that: (1) associations of thrips with their host plants tend to be evolutionarily conservative, with monophyletic groups of thrips on the host\u2010plant genera Acacia, Casuarina and Geijera, (2) galling has evolved multiple times, on different host plants, (3) transitions in domicile use include changes between galling and living in holes or old galls, between living in glued phyllodes and living in old galls, and between leaf \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10039345417480982253", "cites_id": ["10039345417480982253"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-3113.1999.00083.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7U5manfrUosJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 4, "2000": 2, "2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
