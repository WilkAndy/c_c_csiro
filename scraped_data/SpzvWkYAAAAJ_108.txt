All four species of thrips vary remarkably in body form, in association with wing and behavioural polymorphisms. In particular, the previously unknown macropterae of Phallothrips houstoni are strikingly different in body form from the apterae of this species. The weakly armed macropterae invade Iotatubothrips galls, isolate themselves individually within a small, self\u2010built enclosure, and produce a brood of highly armed apterae that then leaves the enclosure and usurps the gall. In contrast, macropterae of Thaumatothrips froggatti are well armed and heavily sclerotised, and apparently do not isolate themselves within a gall subsequent to invading it. One of the two species of Iotatubothrips is here newly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 36, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16178917553036224125", "cites_id": ["16178917553036224125"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.1998.tb01535.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fWYOf8sPh-AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 3, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 3, "2005": 5, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
