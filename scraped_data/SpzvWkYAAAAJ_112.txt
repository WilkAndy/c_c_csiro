In: Zhang, Z.-Q.(Ed.) Animal biodiversity: An outline of higher-level classification and survey of taxonomic richness\u201d. Recent Thysanoptera currently includes 9 families, 767 genera and 5864 species, taxa known only from fossils include 5 families, 47 genera and 155 species fossil taxa are represented in 12 families, 54 genera and 155 species. Thysanoptera is considered sister group to the Hemiptera within the Paraneoptera (Grimaldi & Engel, 2005) 2. Zherikin (2002) Included the Lophioneurina within an Order Thripida, referred to the Thysanoptera as Suborder Thripina, and considered the two suborders listed here as Infraorders Thripomorpha and Phloeothripomorpha. 3.
