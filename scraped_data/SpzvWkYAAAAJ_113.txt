A data matrix with continuous and discrete characters was analysed under parsimony criteria. Continuous and discrete characters were analysed, separately and in combination. When the different blocks of characters were analysed separately, important differences in tree topologies occurred. The optimal tree obtained from discrete characters alone was similar to the tree resulting from total evidence. For most groups, the support values resulting from all the evidence analysis were higher than those obtained from the discrete\u2010only analysis. Two new species from Australia are described and illustrated, Cranothrips ibiscasp.n. and Cranothrips conostylussp.n. A key to the 12 species in the genus is provided. Additionally, the host associations and the distributional patterns of the four worldwide genera of Melanthripidae are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17167110989456765847", "cites_id": ["17167110989456765847"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3113.2008.00445.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l3NGWn3UPe4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
