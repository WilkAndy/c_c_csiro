The list was compiled from museum collections, literature reviews, and records of recent introductions. More than 60 exotic species are from the Caribbean basin, with a few recently introduced species from the Oriental region. The lack of available North American faunal information concerning thrips is emphasized (this being derived from haphazard collecting and in only a few areas), as well as the lack of reliable literature for identifying native North American Thysanoptera."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5544772260741093046", "cites_id": ["5544772260741093046"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.1787.1.3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tpbpYf788kwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 0, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
