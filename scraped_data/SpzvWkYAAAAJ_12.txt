A phylogenetic analysis of the relationships between these families is given, based on consideration of 35 imaginal characters; however, the relationships of Uzelothripidae and Phlaeothripidae to the rest of the Thysanoptera remain equivocal. The Phlaeothripidae are either derived independently from Protothysanoptera, or else are the sister-group of the Thripidae, the most specialized family of Terebrantia. Diagnostic characters, diversity, distribution and relationships of each family are discussed. Keys to family and, in Fauriellidae, to genus are provided.
