Ten of these species have been collected from Casuarina trees. It is suggested that the elongate stylets are adapted to feeding on the chlorophyllous tissue of Casuavina trees, which lies deep in longitudinal furrows of the stem protected by sclerenchyma. Keys are given to the Phlaeothripine genera and species from Casuarina trees. The systematic changes include four new synonyms, five new combinations, six new species, and three new genera; notes are also given on the genera Pygmaeothrips and Teuchothrips which are affected by these changes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9410742646623713748", "cites_id": ["9410742646623713748"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO9700439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1DmgrJOsmYIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
