These studies have documented exceedingly complex responses by Thysanoptera to chemical cues elicited by conspecifics or other arthropods. Responses include aspects such as seeking webbing as refuge when volatiles associated with thrips predation are detected (Venzon et al., 2000), and the presence and detection of certain food sources (pollen) altering thrips behavior and predator/prey interactions (van Rijn et al., 2002). On a more technical level, both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the chemical components of thrips alarm pheromones (MacDonald et al., 2002) and defensive secretions (Suzuki et al., 2000) have been comprehensively described. In contrast, there has been conspicuously little progress made in the chemical basis of thrips/host plant interactions since Kirk\u2019s review in 1995. For many insect taxa, this type of research is the cornerstone of chemical ecology, as it is has direct bearing on insect fitness and host resistance. A diversity of recent studies have documented the variability in thrips performance and host selection based on plant genotype (eg Berg and Le Blanc, 1997; Jager et al., 1996; Kogel et al., 1997a), plant parts (eg Kogel et al., 1997 b, c), plant age (eg Kogel et al., 1997c) or the influence of cultural conditions on thrips preference and performance (eg Vos and Frinking, 1997; Harris et al., 1999). Advances have also been made in the identification of volatile attractants (eg Teulon et al., 1999; Jurgens et al., 2000; Murai et al., 2000).
