It differs from similar members of the genus with a relatively short head in having antennal segments IlI-VI extensively yellow, but the legs dark and the forewings paleo The systematic position of the species is discussed, because it is unusually variable in the chaetotaxy; there are either one 01'two pairs 01'long postocular setae, and lhe males have either two or lbree pairs of long setae on tergite IX. This speeies is apparently monophagous on Didymopanx vinosum, on whieh it sometimes severely damages the apicalleaves and meristem.
