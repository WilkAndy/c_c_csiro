Evolutionary patterns in host-plant exploitation are explored, revealing that thrips generally adopt the dominant elements of a flora and are rarely constrained by host-plant systematic relationships. A few pest species are highly adaptable, feeding on leaf and flower tissue as well as being predators on other arthropods. Scarcely 1% of the 5,000 described species of thrips are serious pests, and most economic literature deals with just four species. Many more thrips are potential pests, and the contribution of various aspects of their biology to opportunism, such as voltinism, vagility, aggregation and reproductive effort, are considered, together with the relevance of this information to pest control strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 190, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3666481091024370393", "cites_id": ["3666481091024370393"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-1409-5_1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2boxXiD14TIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 5, "2002": 14, "2003": 7, "2004": 4, "2005": 9, "2006": 8, "2007": 7, "2008": 12, "2009": 7, "2010": 7, "2011": 9, "2012": 6, "2013": 6, "2014": 8, "2015": 9, "2016": 4, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
