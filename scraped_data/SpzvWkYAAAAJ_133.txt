This is the first published record of a member of this Order of insects from this family of Gymnosperms, but its relationship to these plants remains unknown. Details of the structure of the antennae and seventh abdominal segment suggest that the species is not closely related to any known member of the family Aeolothripidae, and so a new sub-family name is proposed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9743514574860079468", "cites_id": ["9743514574860079468"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222939100770411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bFFg6uHqN4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 3, "1994": 1, "1995": 2, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
