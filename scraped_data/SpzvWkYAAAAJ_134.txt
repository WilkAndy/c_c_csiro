Two new species of Dorythrips Hood are described from Western Australia, although this genus was previously known from a single species in Chile. Five new species of Cranothrips Bagnall are described including two species which are exceptional in the Melanthripini because they lack any elongate major setae. The Palearctic species Rhipidothrips cahirensis Priesner is newly recorded from Australia. Keys are provided to genera and species, and the available information on the biology and distribution of Aeolothripidae is discussed. The new species are Dorythrips jenkinsi, D. wallacei, Cranothrips kartus, C. ravidus, C. sititor, C. symoni, and C. vesper. Andrewarthaia minor Mound and Rhipidothrips aureus Moulton are synonymized with Andrewarthaia kellyana (Bagnall), Lamprothrips maculosus Moulton is synonymized with L \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12649585679250317284", "cites_id": ["12649585679250317284"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.1972.tb01603.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5F-VpydbjK8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 2, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 3, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
