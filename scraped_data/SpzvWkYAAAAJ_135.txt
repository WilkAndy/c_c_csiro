Thrips feed by sucking their food through a single channel enclosed by their modified laciniae. In some plants, the injection of saliva and removal of the contents from living cells induces surrounding cells to become meristematic and develop into galls. The galling habit has arisen on several occasions, in groups of thrips that are not closely related. Thrips galls range from simple leaf distortions to complex structures that provide shelter to many hundreds of individuals. In arid Australia, galls represent a valuable resource for small arthropods, providing protection from low humidity and high insolation. Various species of thrips have evolved usurping behavior towards gall thrips, either as kleptoparasites or as inquilines. The lineage of Phlaeothripinae on Acacia in Australia includes gall-inducing species in which a first generation within a gall is structurally and behaviorally distinct, the individuals functioning as soldiers to defend their gall from invaders."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9043985241033009433", "cites_id": ["9043985241033009433"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20053159057", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Geml3aiwgn0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
