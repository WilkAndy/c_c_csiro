Each larva is restricted to a single floret, and adult body size is thus presumably related to floret size. Despite this, some Chirothrips species are distinguished only on states that are related to body size. The validity of some commonly recorded members of the C. manicatus species-group, including C. africanus and C. pallidicornis, is therefore considered questionable. Character states that have been used to define the genus Agrostothrips Hood are shown to be variable, and this genus is placed as a new synonym of Chirothrips. An identification key, based on illustrated structural differences, is provided to the Chirothrips known from Iran: C. aculeatus, C. atricorpus, C. kurdistanus, C. manicatus, C. meridionalis and C. molestus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2188064104591890953", "cites_id": ["2188064104591890953"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2411.1.3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CZr707WQXR4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
