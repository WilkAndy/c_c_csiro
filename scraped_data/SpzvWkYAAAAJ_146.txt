The genus, predominantly south\u2010east Asian, is redefined  and a key provided to the five described species. Members of this genus feed on leaves  across a wide range of plant families, although each species is host specific. The  host plant of the previously known Australian species, P. setifer Karny, is  newly recognised as Leucopogon lanceolatus (Epacridaceae), and different south\u2010east Asian species are associated with species of Betulaceae, Hamamelidaceae and Fagaceae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10682004598885614631", "cites_id": ["10682004598885614631"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.2002.00276.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J4SqRZYaPpQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
