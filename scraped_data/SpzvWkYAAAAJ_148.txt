On Acacia papyrocarpa, two types of gall are induced by this species, one with the surface ridged but the other with the surface smooth. Using sequence data from cytochrome oxidase subunit I (CO I) and elongation factor-1 alpha gene fragments, we show that the thrips inducing these two gall-types are genetically distinct and comprise separate lineages. Uncorrected \u2018p\u2019 distances calculated from CO I gene fragments were 0.000 and 0.006 within lineages and 0.074 and 0.078 between lineages. The between-lineage distances are comparable with distances between morphologically distinct species of other Acacia gall-thrips. Re-examination of adult thrips from the two gall types revealed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3037420908222332631", "cites_id": ["3037420908222332631"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/88/4/555/2691577", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:177vGzkWJyoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 4, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
