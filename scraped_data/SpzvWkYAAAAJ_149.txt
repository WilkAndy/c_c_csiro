The new species is unusual within this large, primarily Neotropical genus, in that it feeds only on leaves, not in flowers, and that adult females are either apterous or fully winged. Only 10 of the 160 described species of Frankliniella are known to exhibit wing reduction, and notes are given on these together with notes on the seven species of the genus that are not endemic to the New World. Life history studies, including sex and morph ratios, indicate that egg to adult can require as little as 12\u2003d, but despite breeding well in greenhouses, the species is not known to develop large populations in the field in Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16853519815915925254", "cites_id": ["16853519815915925254"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2005.00474.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bu-skvq64-kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
