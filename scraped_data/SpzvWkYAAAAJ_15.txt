This association is the result of a displacement of the brain into the prothoracic region by enlarged cibarial muscles. The subsequent loss of this association leads to a strong input of virus particles into the malpighian tubules via the haemocoel. Mechanical transmission through excrement and oviposition by adults is a possible alternative mode of virus transmission that requires investigation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16014957578732711709", "cites_id": ["16014957578732711709"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170203003903", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HS9QJRGPQN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 6, "2008": 9, "2009": 5, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 11, "2013": 13, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 10, "2017": 11, "2018": 13, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 13, "2023": 1}}
