It is restricted to a single sub-tribe, the Williamsiellina, which includes two genera, Lissothrips with 17 species and Williamsiella with 25 species. Although widely distributed, these genera are particularly common in the New World. Structural variation within and between populations of these small wingless insects is discussed and the conclusion reached that species cannot be defined satisfactorily in the common North American L. muscorum-group without experimental rearing. Trisclerothrips is synonymized with Lissothrips, and Prolissothrips, Microlissothrips and Phthirothrips are synonymized with Williamsiella. One specific synonym is established, and four new species are described: L. clayae from Trinidad, L. okajimai from Japan, W. tambopata from Peru and W \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4634786364795309940", "cites_id": ["4634786364795309940"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article-abstract/96/1/1/2658326", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dM9yg6QRUkAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 4, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
