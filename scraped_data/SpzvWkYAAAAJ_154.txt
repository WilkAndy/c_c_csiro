To explore the phylogenetic relationships and current classification of Thripidae, a cladistic analysis is presented based on 117 morphological characters scored from 114 species representing 94 genera. This analysis was used to reconstruct the ancestral feeding habits of Thripidae, with the result that leaf-feeding is recognised as ancestral within this family, and flower-feeding derived. Thripidae is recovered as a monophyletic group, but the three subfamilies Dendrothripinae, Sericothripinae and Panchaetothripinae are all recovered as nested within the fourth and major subfamily Thripinae. Sericothripinae is related to the Scirtothrips genus-group in Thripinae, but a close relationship to Echinothrips is not supported. Intergeneric relationships within Dendrothripinae are relatively well resolved.
