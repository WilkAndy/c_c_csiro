Ataliothrips is placed as a new synonym of Liothrips, and the micropterous morph of L. reuteri described, this morph being unique among species of Liothrips. Illustrated keys are provided to the species of these genera recorded from Iran, all of which are considered to be leaf-feeding. In addition, a key is provided to the three species of Liophloeothrips from Europe, because L. hungaricus has been recorded from Iran although with no known voucher specimens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:s9ia6_kGH2AC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3657528345297697288", "cites_id": ["3657528345297697288"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3889.1.6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CDpk0aYmwjIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
