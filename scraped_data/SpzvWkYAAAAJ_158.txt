Museum material was complemented by field collections conducted over the period October\u2013November 2009. This inventory was augmented from records in the published literature. Identification of museum and field-collected material added an additional 27 species to the already known fauna, an increase of 54%. A total of 77 species of thrips from 42 genera in four families is now known from 17 different islands in the Galapagos. At least nine species are serious pests, of which four, Frankliniella occidentalis, Gynaikothrips uzeli, Thrips palmi, and Thrips tabaci, are reported from the Galapagos Islands in the primary scientific literature for the first time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2579659742535999032", "cites_id": ["2579659742535999032"], "pub_url": "https://bioone.org/journals/pacific-science/volume-65/issue-4/65.4.507/Thysanoptera-of-the-Gal%C3%A1pagos-Islands/10.2984/65.4.507.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ON47Q97KzCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 5}}
