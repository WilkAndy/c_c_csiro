Due to the long history of regular interceptions of C.\u2003fasciatus in Australia, a survey for this thrips was undertaken around airports, seaports, public recreational parks and major agricultural areas in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to determine whether C.\u2003fasciatus has successfully invaded Australia. Host plants that are known to support populations of C.\u2003fasciatus, such as various annual and perennial agricultural crops, urban ornamentals and weeds along with native Australian flora, were sampled for this thrips. A total of 4675 thrips specimens encompassing at least 76 species from a minimum of 47 genera, and three families were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17542896917586152169", "cites_id": ["17542896917586152169"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2006.00528.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6YoE4MzjdPMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 3, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 4}}
