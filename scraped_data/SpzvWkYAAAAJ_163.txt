Mutation of genes controlling male characteristics will therefore not be subject to selection, and so structural variation in these males is of no taxonomic significance. It is concluded that haemorrhoidalis and ceylonicus Schmutz represent one species in which the females vary in size, sculpture and colour throughout the tropics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6358865928396192294", "cites_id": ["6358865928396192294"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-entomological-research/article/identity-of-the-greenhouse-thrips-heliothrips-haemorrhoidalis-bouche-thysanoptera-and-the-taxonomic-significance-of-spanandric-males/97133CF612F771C6D63930F4661A3962", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JrpjBN86P1gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
