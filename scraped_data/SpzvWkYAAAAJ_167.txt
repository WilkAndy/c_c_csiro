The characters chosen were those used by previous authors in describing species in this genus. The range of variation within populations encompassed the differences, recorded in the available literature, between H. tritici Kurdjumov and H. cerealis Priesner, and no evidence of bimodality in the data was recovered. We conclude that H. tritici is the only common Haplothrips species on cereal crops in Iran, although the validity of H. cerealis as a distinct species elsewhere will require further studies. The variation recorded here has broader implications for taxonomic studies on the genus Haplothrips. (\u00a9 2010 WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
