Our study showed that a single foundress initiates a gall. Her first\u2010laid eggs develop into soldiers (mean number of soldiers \u00b1 SE\u2003=\u200328\u2003\u00b1\u200315, 40% males, with no evidence for protogyny or protandry). The soldiers, along with the foundress, produce the (subsequent) dispersing generation (mean number of dispersers \u00b1 SE\u2003=\u2003187\u2003\u00b1\u200310, 37% males with no evidence for protogyny or protandry). The brood development\u2010pattern of O.\u2003kinchega is similar to that found in the complex of forms currently referred to as Oncothrips habrus Mound and Oncothrips waterhousei Mound & Crespi and is different from that of Oncothrips morrisi Mound, Crespi & Kranz, a species with soldiers but a non\u2010social development pattern. However, O.\u2003kinchega shares several life history \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18422049925770545292", "cites_id": ["18422049925770545292"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2004.00399.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jIgQpM1EqP8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
