Recent studies have emphasized the diversity of behavioural patterns amongst these diminutive insects. From the 5,500 species known worldwide, about 10% are recorded from Brazil, mostly tropical areas. In this work we surveyed the Thysanoptera fauna of a southern locality, 800 km south of the Tropic of Capricorn. The study site was ''Parque Estadual de Itapu\u00e3'' (30\u00b022'S 51\u00b002'W), Viam\u00e3o, RS, and thrips were sampled from wild flowers, branches, grass and litter, from June 1999 to May 2001. A total of 83 species in 32 genera was found, but only 29 of these species could be identified, emphasizing the poor knowledge of the insect fauna of southern Brazil."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1434530979773430205", "cites_id": ["1434530979773430205"], "pub_url": "https://www.scielo.br/j/ne/a/CTrGyptSHLSrF5qmRX4Qswd/?format=html&lang=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vTmwXFN66BMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
