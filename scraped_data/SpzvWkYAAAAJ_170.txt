Australian National Insect Collection, Canberra", "abstract": "Southeastern USA is home to a complex of native and adventive Frankliniella species, as well as the thrips predator Orius insidiosus. The primary Frankliniella species present in this region are F. occidentalis, F. tritici, F. bispinosa, and F. fusca. This diversity presents a model system for examining how species-specific behavioral attributes affect large-scale spatial and temporal population dynamics and predator-prey interactions. Here we discuss how interspecific variation in behavior of thrips can produce different spatial and temporal dynamics for populations of these species, and how variation in thrips behavior could impact regulation of thrips populations by the predator O. insidiosus. We examined interspecific differences in development, fecundity, activity, and susceptibility to predation. We found that O. insidiosus is able to prey effectively on F. occidentalis, F. tritici and F. bispinosa. However, less mobile prey, such as larvae and adults of F. occidentalis, tend to be more vulnerable to predation than are more mobile prey, such as adults of F. bispinosa. Previous research has demonstrated, both theoretically and empirically, that the predator O. insidiosus has the capacity to regulate populations of thrips, but our results indicate that the regulatory ability of O. insidiosus will be mediated by species-specific behavioral differences of their thrips prey. are native to this region, whereas F. occidentalis is an invasive species that has been present in the southeastern USA for just over 20 years (Beshear, 1983). Despite their similarity in appearance and their overlapping host ranges, these species display radically different population dynamics (Cho et al \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1050292615023100612", "cites_id": ["1050292615023100612"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamito-Sakurai/publication/267328098_REGGIO_E/links/544ab5840cf2d6347f401ee3/REGGIO-E.pdf#page=133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xAKrlJFjkw4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
