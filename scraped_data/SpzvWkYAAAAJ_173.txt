The offspring of the first generation within each gall develop into soldiers as adults. These individuals have enlarged fore legs which they use to defend their gall from invaders. Twelve species in three genera of Phlaeothripidae are now known to induce phyllode galls on Australian Acacia trees, and four of these in two genera produce soldiers."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2517319247786650490", "cites_id": ["2517319247786650490"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222939500770081", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:equTvoRQ7yIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 3, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
