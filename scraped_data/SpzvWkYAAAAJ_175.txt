Horistothrips curviseta Girault is transferred to Neocecidothrips as the second species in that genus and its host-plant is identified. Cryptothrips additamentus Karny is transferred to Gynaikothrips Zimmermann and identified as a common kleptoparasite in the leaf roll galls of Gynaikothrips australis Bagnall. A key is provided to 13 Australian species remaining in Teuchothrips; host-plants are recognised for six of these, but seven remain known only from their original fragmented specimens."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3780666933764653721", "cites_id": ["3780666933764653721"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.1714.1.5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mYIboYugdzQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
