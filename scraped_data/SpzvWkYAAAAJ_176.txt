Banana fruits were severely damaged by the thrips infestation and a typical smoky-red discoloration of the fruit was observed. Pest control was poor using either high-pressure washing with potassium fatty acids, or commercially available thrips predatorsNeoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) andOrius laevigatus (Fieber) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). During 2005H. femoralis was also found causing severe damage in conventional banana plantations in Arvi, the main banana-growing area of Crete."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11298340425797567593", "cites_id": ["11298340425797567593"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02981204", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aYQZj8HEy5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
