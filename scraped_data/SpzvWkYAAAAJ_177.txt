The monophyly of Sericothripinae is recovered, but the metasternal shape, as used in the current generic classification, probably does not reflect phylogeny. In accord with recent molecular studies, Thripinae of the Scirtothrips genus-group together with the genus Echinothrips were recovered as closely related to Sericothripinae, but Psilothrips and Pseudothrips were recovered as unrelated to Sericothripinae. Many morphological character states among Sericothripinae are considered homoplasious, and formal nomenclatural changes are deferred in the absence of suitable molecular analyses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8393273661958611613", "cites_id": ["8393273661958611613"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044523116300109", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nWKvE-3lenQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
