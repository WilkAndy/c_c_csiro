The chaetotaxy of the pronotum and head of each of these 5 holotypes was found to fall within the range observed on specimens identified as S. perseae based DNA analyses and subsequent slide mounting and morphological examina tion of the body surface of specimens from which analyzed DNA was extracted. As a result of morphological examination and complementary DNA analyses, these 5 species are con sidered synonyms of S. perseae. This synonomy should reduce potential quarantine disputes over avocado imports from Mexico that could arise from concerns raised over the large num ber of Scirtothrips species previously considered as pests of avocados in Mexico that might \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12436290721899846655", "cites_id": ["12436290721899846655"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/20065921", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_5tTcoWUlqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
