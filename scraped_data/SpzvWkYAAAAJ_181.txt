The original species placed in this genus, N. dalmatica Schmutz, 1909, is phytophagous, feeding and breeding in the flowers of various Lamiaceae in countries of the southern Palaearctic region. In contrast, Moulton & Steinweden (1933), and Moulton (1944), described species in Neoheegeria that are now recognised as spore-feeding thrips in the subfamily Idolothripinae, and several other species that were placed originally in this genus are now removed to other genera (Table 1). Mound (1968) suggested that Neoheegeria should be restricted to a particular group of species, but subsequently (Mound 2005) placed all Neoheegeria species in the genus Haplothrips Amyot & Serville, 1843. This type of confusion in the taxonomy of the Thysanoptera arises from three sources: lack of precision in defining taxonomic character-states and their variation within and between populations, inadequate field sampling resulting in limited knowledge of the biology of so many species, and description of new"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9753480182149282729", "cites_id": ["9753480182149282729"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/3z4yjfxmrfdi3gpohb3rrnmara/access/wayback/http://www.nev.nl/tve/pdf/te0150055.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qfvRrIxSW4cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 5, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
