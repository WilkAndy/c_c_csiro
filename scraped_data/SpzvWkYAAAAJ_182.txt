With an adult body length of scarcely 1 mm, all life stages of the thrips were found living solitarily inside leaf domatia of a Rubiaceous under-story rain-forest tree in Costa Rica. The literature on the significance of leaf domatia and their relationships to arthropods is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4081230833717385325", "cites_id": ["4081230833717385325"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/25010023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bZgY6tFxozgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
