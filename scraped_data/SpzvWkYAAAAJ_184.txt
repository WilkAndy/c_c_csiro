In the present paper, an attempt is made to clarify the generic position of several species-groups (including species infesting cereals, sugar-cane and grasses) and their relationships with the genus Thrips. A checklist of species is included under each genus. Among the taxonomic changes proposed, the existing broad concept of Baliothrips is revised to include only 2 species (one being B. dispar (Hal.)); 4 genera (Fulmekiola, Sphaeropothrips, Stenchaetothrips and Stenothrips) are resurrected from synonymy and recognised as valid. The resulting new nomenclatorial combinations for species are listed, including Stenchaetothrips biformis (Bagn.) on rice and Sphaeropothrips vittipennis (Bagn.), both transferred from Baliothrips. A key to the 7 genera and the genus Thrips is given, and numerous species are illustrated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14309807630229094470", "cites_id": ["14309807630229094470"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19810588558", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RsD6GzmmlsYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
