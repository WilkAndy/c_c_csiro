This thrips species breeds inside the wasp colonies, and larval and adult thrips feed on wasp eggs, which become severely damaged. Infested nests can contain up to 300 M. arbiter gen. et sp. nov. individuals. The closest relatives of M. arbiter are two presumably predaceous species: Mirothrips bicolorsp. nov., which inhabits abandoned Cecidomyiidae galls, and Mirothrips analiscomb. nov., described from individuals collected in the silken bags of the caterpillars of Psychidae moths. The behaviour exhibited by M. arbiter represents one of the most evolutionarily advanced lifestyles known among Thysanoptera, and we predict that other polistine species \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7366381685483630191", "cites_id": ["7366381685483630191"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/109/2/332/2415919", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b-4xOx2lOmYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
