Currently, its only known host is Dunatothrips aneurae, a subsocial thrips that creates silken domiciles by securing together phyllodes of mulga (Acacia aneura) in the arid zone of Australia. We found Ak. francisi prolifically breeding inside live D. aneurae host domiciles, both immature and mature. Akainothrips francisi did not kill its host and we saw no evidence of antagonistic host-inquiline interactions. This is thus the second demonstrably inquiline species of Acacia thrips, although other possible inquilines have been suggested including two Akainothrips. We found that Ak. francisi occurred with positive density dependence, and was associated with moderately reduced host reproduction. This latter association was especially evident in larger host domiciles, suggesting that Ak \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7249757392978583174", "cites_id": ["7249757392978583174"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/107/1/112/2701503", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hh5AJPBPnGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
