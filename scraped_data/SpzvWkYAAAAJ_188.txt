Systematic relationships of these species with others in South\u2010east Asia and the Australasian region are discussed. Two new species\u2010groups are designated: the T.\u2003obscuratus group of six species from New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the T.\u2003orientalis group of 12 South\u2010east Asian species that are associated with scented white flowers such as Gardenia. Four species of this second group are recorded from tropical Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6236768918879122989", "cites_id": ["6236768918879122989"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2005.00505.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Lbb8s0l0jVYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
