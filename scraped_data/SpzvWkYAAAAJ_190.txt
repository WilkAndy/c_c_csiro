However, IPM strategies require an understanding of temporal and spatial life\u2010history variations and sex ratios. Hence, different circumstances with regard to mating and sperm storage, and their effects on the life history of the adults and progeny, were tested in Echinothrips americanus. Different conditions were investigated: (1) one female and one male with permanent access to each other, (2) one female and one male with limited access to each other, (3) one virgin male only, (4) one virgin female only and (5) two virgin females permanently associated. Mating or not mating has a significant effect on the longevity of females and males, and on female fecundity. As a result of tested condition (2), limited access has a positive effect on longevity of a male. On the other hand, permanent access (1) or no access to a female (3) leads to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16177741836075545201", "cites_id": ["16177741836075545201"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jen.12280", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cTJCj3ziguAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 5, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
