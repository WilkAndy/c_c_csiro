In the Tribe Pygothripini, subtribe Pygothripina, Ecacleistothrips glorious gen. et sp. n. is a large and highly polymorphic rainforest thrips: the apterous male has a transverse first abdominal tergite, in contrast to the females that have a reduced pelta as is typical of most Phlaeothripidae. Also in this subtribe, Heptathrips cumberi Mound & Walker from New Zealand is recorded widely around the southern coasts of Australia. A key is provided to the six genera of Pygothripini subtribe Allothripina in which the terminal sensorium of the maxillary palps is unusually large. In this group, four wingless species are considered: Minaeithrips aliceae gen. et sp. n. and M. driesseni sp. n. in which the maxillary stylets are wide apart, Allothrips hamideae sp. n. in which the third antennal segment has a basal flange unlike any other member of this widespread genus, and Priesneriella citricauda Hood that was previously known only from California. In the Pygothripini subtribe Macrothripina, Polytrichothrips geoffri sp. n. is described from rainforest; this genus was known previously from a single species in Sarawak. A further rainforest species, Malesiathrips australis sp. n., is described in the Tribe Idolothripini, subtribe Elaphrothripina; this genus was known previously from three species in the Asian and Pacific regions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15148179390611849636", "cites_id": ["15148179390611849636"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.1604.1.5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pAFQs-UkOdIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
