These thrips all have the last abdominal segment unusually elongate, but this is a variable and homoplastic character state, and the tribe remains ill\u2010defined. Worldwide, 27 species in three genera are now recognised, with five other generic names here included as synonyms of Leeuwenia Karny. From Australia, six species in two genera are recorded here occurring in the eastern rainforests. Four newly described Australian species and their host plants are: Leeuwenia diospyri sp. n. (Diospyros pentamera\u2013Ebenaceae); L.\u2003polyosmae sp. n. (Polyosma cunninghamii\u2013Grossulariaceae); L.\u2003scolopiae sp. n. (Scolopia braunii\u2013Flacourtiaceae); and L. tetrastigmae sp. n. (Tetrastigma nitens\u2013Vitaceae).
