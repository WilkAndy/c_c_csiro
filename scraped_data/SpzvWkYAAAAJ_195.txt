Females of each of these thrips species have an array of very stout spines on the abdomen, and in two of them the anal area is asymmetric and directed dorsally, bearing two pairs of stout setae. The lateral abdominal armature has arisen by multiplication of the plesiotypic setal pattern of the sternites. Observations suggest that members of this genus use their armature to expel a resident thrips from its domicile of tied or glued phyllodes, and then to defend this living space from other intruders. Seven species are now recognised in the genus, of which the following five are described as new species: X. eremus, X. foederatus, X. mulga, X. rhodopus and X. zophus. Three of these are associated with Acacia aneura, whereas the two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:MLfJN-KU85MC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10638332723318244024", "cites_id": ["10638332723318244024"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.1999.00111.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uELMXz_zopMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
