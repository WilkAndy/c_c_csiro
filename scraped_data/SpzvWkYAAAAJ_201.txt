At least 55 thrips species in 36 genera and three families were identified from 823 slide-mounted specimens that were collected from 61 host plants in 33 families. Twelve species are considered to be important pests. The greatest diversity of species, 43 (77%), was collected from the Society Islands, with 60% being recorded from Tahiti alone. Species diversity was intermediate in the Marquesas Islands at 43% (24 species collected), with 35% or 19 species being recorded from Nuku Hiva. Lowest diversity was recorded for the Austral Islands, with 38% or 21 species being found in that archipelago. Less than 10% of collected species are likely to be native \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8465436361270260573", "cites_id": ["8465436361270260573"], "pub_url": "https://bioone.org/journals/Pacific-Science/volume-62/issue-4/1534-6188(2008)62[509:IOTCFF]2.0.CO;2/Inventory-of-Thysanoptera-Collected-from-French-Polynesia1/10.2984/1534-6188(2008)62[509:IOTCFF]2.0.CO;2.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XXMwzoRFe3UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 4, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
