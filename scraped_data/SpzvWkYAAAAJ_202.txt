(Insecta: Thysanoptera) is described as the second species of the genus. This species is widespread in Australia on Podocarpus and Callitris male cones, but the only other species in the genus is from New Zealand breeding in vegetative buds of Podocarpus. This is possibly an example of trans-Tasman vicariance, although the thrips fauna of New Zealand is shown to be largely dispersed from Tasmania and mainland Australia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6059256041395340592", "cites_id": ["6059256041395340592"], "pub_url": "https://eprints.utas.edu.au/13356/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MEWCLkTNFlQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
