These thrips all live in association with other, as yet undescribed, phlaeothripine species that construct, and breed within, domiciles on the phyllodes of Acacia trees in the arid areas of Australia. The new species all have particularly unusual structures at the anterior end of the body. Crespithrips enigmaticus gen. et sp. n. and Crespithrips hesperus sp. n. both have the inner margin of antennal segment I produced into a long bifurcate tooth and the median antennal segments bear an unusual array of supernumerary small sense cones. Crespithrips enigmaticus has been found breeding within domiciles comprising pairs of glued phyllodes. These domiciles were produced on different species of Acacia by two undescribed species of an undescribed genus related to Dunatothrips Moulton.
