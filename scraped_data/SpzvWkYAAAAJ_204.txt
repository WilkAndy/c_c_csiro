Cladistic analysis of character states in these and related taxa indicates that the present family classification in the lower clades of the Thysanoptera is not strongly supported."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1134713182117480732", "cites_id": ["1134713182117480732"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/25010264", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HMkQjqBPvw8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 3}}
