These taxa are more closely related to each other than to any other known Australian thrips. The male phallotheca is much longer, and the ventral surface of abdominal segment 10 is more deeply excavate, than in any other Phlaeothripidae. The method of gall induction is not understood, but it may involve a fungus. Two of the thrips species compete for space with the primary species, and this competitive behaviour is reflected in their greatly enlarged forelegs."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5081754424558604019", "cites_id": ["5081754424558604019"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222939200770221", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:886Vj7kEhkYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 1, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
