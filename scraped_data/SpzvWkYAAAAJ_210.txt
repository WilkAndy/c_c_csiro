Carientothrips is distinguished based on the unusual form of the maxillary palps. Two species, badius Hood comb. n. and capricornis Mound comb. n., are transferred to Nesothrips from Carientothrips; and Nesothrips melinus Mound syn. n. is synonymised with Carientothrips miskoi Mound. In Carientothrips the following six new species are described: alienatus sp. n., calami sp. n., horni sp. n., palumai sp. n., snowi sp. n., tasmanica sp. n.; while flavitibia Moulton stat. rev. is recalled from synonymy with C. mjobergi (Karny). In Nesothrips four new species are described: barrowi sp. n., brigalowi sp. n., coorongi sp. n., rossi sp. n.; while rhizophorae (Girault) syn. n. is placed as a synonym of minor Bagnall."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5243441160196796534", "cites_id": ["5243441160196796534"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3821.2.2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:djAxSvRxxEgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
