The diet primarily comprises spores of a recently described species of Dothiorella (Botryosphaeriaceae). The 14\u03bcm-wide food canal enclosed by the maxillary stylets is evidently adapted to imbibe whole spores, and the foregut includes a sclerotized proventriculus with internal ridges that presumably aids in the abrasion and thus digestion of the thick-walled spores."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10278490387348596465", "cites_id": ["10278490387348596465"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222930903395150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8SYurYyIpI4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
