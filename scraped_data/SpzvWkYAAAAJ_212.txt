Single\u2010fold galls are subject to invasion by two species of kleptoparasitic Phlaeothripidae, to which double\u2010fold galls are largely immune. This thripid is a member of a southeast Asian lineage of Thripinae in which gall\u2010induction is possibly recurrent. This lineage includes the genus Chaetanaphothrips in which some species are crop pests but not gall\u2010inducing. Females of Cyrilthrips have a unique curved spur on the hind coxae, and the ocellar chaetotaxy is also unique among Thripidae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8097936195618949803", "cites_id": ["8097936195618949803"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222930902807767", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q0qlsRCmYXAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 3, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
