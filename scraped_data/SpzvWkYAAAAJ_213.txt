This study compiled an inventory of the invertebrate fauna of epiphyte mats in the canopy of northern rata (Myrtaceae: Metrosideros robusta A. Cunn.) at two study sites on the West Coast of the South Island. A total of 242 069 invertebrate specimens was collected over one year, representing 4 phyla, 9 classes and more than 160 families, 225 genera and 446 species. At least 10 new species and 3 new genera were identified, while 5 species were recorded outside their known geographical range. Epiphyte mats provided habitat for an invertebrate fauna, highly diverse and abundant both taxonomically and functionally, dominated in terms of abundance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:U4n9YNQMCAIC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16319259808970742261", "cites_id": ["16319259808970742261"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03014220909510150", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9ZkCR1WoeeIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
