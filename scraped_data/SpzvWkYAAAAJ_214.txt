These thrips are locally abundant in leaf\u2010litter in Australia, particularly in Eucalyptus litter, and each is presumed to feed on fungal hyphae. Almost all individuals are wingless but, in contrast to many fungus\u2010feeding Phlaeothripidae, none of the species show any within\u2010sex polymorphism. Representatives of the genus have been found in all Australian states and territories except the Northern Territory and, despite winged individuals being rare, several of the species are widespread."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5006773156712199919", "cites_id": ["5006773156712199919"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.2002.00296.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:77bKtKihe0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
