Three of the five major Families of Thysanoptera (Aeolothripidae, Heterothripidae, Melanthripidae) are not known to include any pest species. The Phlaeothripidae that includes more than 50% of the 6300 thrips species listed includes very few that are considered to be pests. Within the Thripidae, the members of the three smaller subfamilies, Panchaetothripinae, Dendrothripinae and Sericothripinae, include remarkably few species that result in serious crop losses. It is only in the subfamily Thripinae, and particularly among species of the Frankliniella genus-group and the Thrips genus-group that the major thrips species are found, including all but one of the vectors of Orthotospovirus infections. It is argued that the concept of pest is a socio-economic problem, with the pest status of any particular species being dependent on geographical area, cultivation practices, and market expectations as much as the intrinsic biology of any thrips species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9893474048231489408", "cites_id": ["9893474048231489408"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1436840", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gD9inzquTIkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
