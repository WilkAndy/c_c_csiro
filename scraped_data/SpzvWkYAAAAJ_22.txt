Thysanoptera.", "publisher": "CAB International", "abstract": "This book is aimed at students and is divided into 2 main sections. In the first, the biology of thrips and techniques for collecting, preparing and mounting specimens are described, and problems of identification are outlined. The deleterious effects of thrips as insect pests of crops and flowers, vectors of plant viruses and nuisance-causing organisms, and their beneficial effects as pollinators and biological control agents of small arthropods and certain weed species are briefly discussed. The characters used in thrips taxonomy are described. In the second, major, part of the book, a key is provided to the economically important Thysanoptera. There is a bibliography of 76 references pertaining to Thysanoptera, and an appendix giving a table of the world distribution of the most common thrips genera, and indicating their prey and major effect on crops in each geographical region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:WWeOtg8bX_EC", "num_citations": 139, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12193784755736424356", "cites_id": ["12193784755736424356"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19891130074", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pC8-QaEGOakJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 2, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 3, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 1, "2004": 4, "2005": 8, "2006": 4, "2007": 9, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 3, "2013": 5, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 11, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
