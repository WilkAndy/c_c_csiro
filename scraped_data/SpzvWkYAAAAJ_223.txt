Introduced to Australia in about 2002, populations of this thrips have been found only on the pasture weed Mother of Millions, Bryophyllum delagoense (Eckl. & Zeyh.) 1900. To evaluate the potential risk by these populations to plants of economic significance, under laboratory conditions, whether S.\u2009aurantii collected from Mother of Millions in Queensland can survive, reproduce and maintain populations over multiple generations on non\u2010target hosts was tested. That this thrips can form self\u2010sustaining populations on mango, grape, chilli, pea, green bean and blueberry was showed. Extended adult lifespan and some juvenile production were found on lemon and orange, but populations did not persist on these hosts. Furthermore, female thrips accept mango and grape for oviposition as readily as Mother of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2349528886240919500", "cites_id": ["2349528886240919500"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aen.12028", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zL_o3RI0myAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 3, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
