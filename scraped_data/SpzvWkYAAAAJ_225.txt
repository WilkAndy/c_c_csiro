Seven of these species are known from tropical areas to the north of Australia ['Anaphothrips swezeyi' Moulton; 'Bathrips melanicornis' (Shumsher); 'Caprithrips orientalis' Bhatti; 'Craspedothrips minor' (Bagnall); 'Danothrips trifasciatus' Sakimura; 'Mycterothrips nilgirinsis' (Ananthakrishnan); 'Scolothrips asura' Ramakrishna and Margabandhu]. The other two have been collected on plant species also found in Asia ['Mycterothrips desleyae' Masumoto and Okajima; 'Pseudodetiilrothrip alexei sp. n.]. These records further emphasise the difficulties of distinguishing between native and invasive thrips species in the northern Australian fauna."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16503658047133389198", "cites_id": ["16503658047133389198"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.069169719726169", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jhHnwY3FCOUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
