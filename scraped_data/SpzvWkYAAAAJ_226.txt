Majerthrips barrowi gen. et sp. n. is a large species exhibiting polymorphism associated with wing development and sex, whereas Senithrips psomus gen. et sp. n. is a minute monomorphic species with little sexual dimorphism. Also monomorphic is Jacotia rhodorcha sp. n., the fourth species described in this genus from Australia. These three were all taken during a biodiversity survey of Barrow Island, Western Australia. Structural variation in Streptothrips tribulatius sp. n. from Cape Tribulation, Queensland, confirms the existence of dimorphism in this genus between winged and wingless individuals. Stomothrips mouldeni differs from the single described species in this genus in having the mouth cone directed ventrally not posteriorly; it was collected from Cycas pruinosa in the north of Western Australia. Also in this area but living at the base of Triodia grasses, Apostlethrips apostus and A. pygus gen. et spp. n. are remarkable amongst the Eurythrips group of leaf-litter phlaeothripines in lacking sense cones on antennal segment III, and lacking tergal wing retaining setae in macropterae, also in the setose abdominal apex."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4035551973260390452", "cites_id": ["4035551973260390452"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.1150.1.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NPDPbiMpATgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
