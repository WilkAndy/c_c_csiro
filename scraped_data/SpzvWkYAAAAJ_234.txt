During joint CSIRO/USDA studies on potential biological control agents, a thrips species was found widely in south\u2010eastern Asia causing severe damage to L.\u2003microphyllum. Described here as a new species, Octothrips lygodii, this is the second species of a poorly known genus that has been based on a single damaged male from Papua New Guinea. The genus is redefined, the two species distinguished, and notes given on the range of Thripidae reported from ferns worldwide."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12613791892430607025", "cites_id": ["12613791892430607025"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.2002.00297.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sVIHO-UwDa8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
