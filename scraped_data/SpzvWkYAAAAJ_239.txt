However, specimens that are identical in colour and structure are reported from northern Brazil, and this is presumably the area of origin of this new species. The area of origin within South America of the Greenhouse Thrips, Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis, is discussed and remains in doubt. An identification key to the four species of Heliothrips is provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10132528402979580654", "cites_id": ["10132528402979580654"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4638.1.8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7mon6OX4nYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
