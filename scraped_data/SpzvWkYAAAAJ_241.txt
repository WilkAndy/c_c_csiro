Unlike most species of this Holarctic genus, the fore tarsi and fore tibiae do not have any teeth. The base of the sensorium on the sixth antennal segment is more than half as long as the total length of this sensorium, as is typical of species in the genera Odontothrips and Odontothripiella. In contrast, species of the Asian tropical genus Megalurothrips have the base of this sensorium less than 0.3 as long as the sensorium. Almost all species in these three genera breed only in flowers of Fabaceae. Males of this new species bear on tergum IX a pair of stout sigmoid processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7226081878062107418", "cites_id": ["7226081878062107418"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2729.1.4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GovHwy4zSGQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
