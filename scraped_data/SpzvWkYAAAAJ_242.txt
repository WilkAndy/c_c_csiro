Given the diverse feeding relationships among thrips, involving other arthropods and possibly even vertebrates, it is likely that thrips come into contact with other members of the Bunyaviridae from time to time. Given the lack of evidence of any evolutionary association between thrips and tospoviruses (Mound, 2003), the possibility that these plant diseases might have arisen by mutation from some animal parasite should probably be considered. The following report, concerning the first thrips species reported to be ectoparasitic on another insect, may thus have significance when considering the origin of the relationship between tospoviruses and thrips."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11307146922940330890", "cites_id": ["11307146922940330890"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rita-Marullo/publication/281003047_Thrips_and_Tospoviruses_Proceedings_of_the_7th_International_Symposium_on_Thysanoptera/links/562bf1e808aef25a2441cda7/Thrips-and-Tospoviruses-Proceedings-of-the-7th-International-Symposium-on-Thysanoptera.pdf#page=273", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:inMC9TcO65wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 2, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
