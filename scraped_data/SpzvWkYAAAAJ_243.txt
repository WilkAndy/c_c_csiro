It is very similar in structure to H. haemorrhoidalis, the greenhouse thrips. Because nearly all known males of H. haemorroidalis have been found in the western part of the Amazon basin, it is suggested that this is the area of origin of this worldwide pest. The only other member of the genus is from southern Africa, and a key is provided to distinguish the three species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10755316453340157577", "cites_id": ["10755316453340157577"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/25010239", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iRZBiFSPQpUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
