Scirtothrips hansoni sp. n. is closely related to the Californian pest, S. perseae, and also to S. astrictus from Costa Rica that remains known from a single female. An illustrated key to these three species is provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4795894405462752650", "cites_id": ["4795894405462752650"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4079.3.7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iv3jUY1wjkIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
