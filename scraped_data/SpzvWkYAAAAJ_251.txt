There was no thrips flight activity during the night. Numbers of total thrips caught on traps were more abundant between hours 05: 30-8: 30 and then slightly decreased during premid day (hours 08: 30-11: 30) and mid-day (hours 11: 30-14: 30). Flights of female thrips were similar to that of total thrips. Population densities of males remained at similar levels during hours 05: 30-14: 30 and then significantly decreased during evening hours. Population densities of total thrips on white flowers were very low at hour 05: 30. No significant difference in the number of thrips was observed among the hours 11: 30-17: 30. Population levels of female thrips increased after hour 05: 30 and remained at similar level, whereas the population of males slightly increased during the hours 08: 30-14: 30. The population of thrips was more abundant on red flowers at early morning hour 05: 30, however, decreased until 11: 30. Population density of larvae in white flowers regularly increased during hours 05: 30-17: 30."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3391072887914091273", "cites_id": ["3391072887914091273"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamito-Sakurai/publication/267328098_REGGIO_E/links/544ab5840cf2d6347f401ee3/REGGIO-E.pdf#page=225", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CdOTK9OCDy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
