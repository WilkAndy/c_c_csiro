In the Brazilian literature T. tabaci has been mentioned as a common early season phytophagous pest of cotton. However, there are no references to collections (voucher specimens) or to identification methods that can clarify these records. In contrast, among many samples of thrips collected between 1992 and 1996 (mostly in 1995) on cotton, in 30 counties from five states and four geographic regions, not a single specimen was found. If T. tabaci occurs commonly on this crop in Brazil, even at relatively low populations, then at least some individuals should have been collected in this survey. Most of the thrips specimens taken from cotton were Frankliniella schultzei (Trybom), although Caliothrips phaseoli (Hood) and unidentified Frankliniella spp. were also found in low numbers in few samples."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4488485980260308907", "cites_id": ["4488485980260308907"], "pub_url": "https://www.scielo.br/j/aseb/a/6FwcqsbFvyRvpjbmWvMbPyM/?lang=pt", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q5e80DdOSj4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 3, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
