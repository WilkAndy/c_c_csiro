As nymphs, as well as adults, they live mainly on herbs and grasses; however, some species favour bushes such as alders and willows. The spittle masses ('cuckoo spit','frog spit') produced by the nymphs at the feeding sites are often very conspicuous. The habit of forming spittle clumps renders the nymphal stage amenable to studies on feeding ecology within and between species. Not only is it easy to locate each nymph on its food plant, but nymphs belonging to different species are rather easy to identify. Eight species of the family Aphrophoridae are known from Finland (Linnavuori, 1969). The following four are the subjects of investigation in the present study: Philaenus spumarius, Neophilaenus lineatus, Lepyronia coleoptrata and Aphrophora alni."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:Og1tA8FjbJAC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=566451389685373465", "cites_id": ["566451389685373465"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=566451389685373465&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GRq5qIlw3AcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 3, "1984": 2, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
