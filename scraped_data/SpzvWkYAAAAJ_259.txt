One species, H. semicaecus (Uzel), is recorded in Australia for the first time, and H. corticis (De Geer) and H. orientalis (Ananthakrishnan) are newly recorded from the Australian mainland. Structural diversity among the species of the genus Hoplothrips is discussed. Members of this genus share many character states with species of Deplorothrips, Hoplandrothrips and Psalidothrips that also live as fungal-hyphal feeders on dead branches and in leaf litter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7417059578069743022", "cites_id": ["7417059578069743022"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4718.3.1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rnXBlGOw7mYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
