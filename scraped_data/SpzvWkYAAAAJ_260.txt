Sexual dimorphism in pronotal sculpture and posteroangular setae is described in D. magnoliae. The major host plants of several species are indicated, and the wide distribution across Asia of some species emphasised. Species of Dendrothrips from China are reviewed, D. octosparsus sp. n. is described from Oleaceae, and a key presented to the ten species from China. Two species previously known only from Japan, D. magnoliae Kud\u00f4 and D. latimaculatus Nonaka & Okajima, are newly recorded from China along with the first description of their males. The male of D. homalii Zhang & Tong is described and illustrated. The record from China of D. mendax Bhatti is considered a misidentification of D. latimaculatus. D. schmiae Kud\u00f4 is synonymized with D. minowai Priesner."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:wE-fMHVdjMkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14610922354178482110", "cites_id": ["14610922354178482110"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4590.2.2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vl-fGXhsxMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
