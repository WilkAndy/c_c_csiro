Although eleven species in this genus have been listed from China before, only seven species here are recognised. The records of F. pallida and F. tritici from China are rejected as inadequately supported, F. hainanensis is a new synonym of F. schultzei, and F. zizaniophila is now considered a member of the genus Iridothrips. An identification key for the seven species is provided here, two of them are widespread across the Palearctic (F. intonsa and F. tenuicornis), one is presumably Oriental (F. lilivora), and four are introduced from the Americas (F. occidentalis, F. schultzei, F. cephalica and F. williamsi)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1214624496680236675", "cites_id": ["1214624496680236675"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6728319/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g_YcXIs22xAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
