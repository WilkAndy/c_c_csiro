Four of these are native Australian species, seven are native to south-eastern Asia, with one species known only from Costa Rica and one known from several sites around the Caribbean. New host and locality records are given for a further 15 species, and the situation is noted that some species established on the Hawaiian Islands are pests in other parts of the world but have failed to become problematic here."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16879609846903196339", "cites_id": ["16879609846903196339"], "pub_url": "https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/48463", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s8rZR7lrQOoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
