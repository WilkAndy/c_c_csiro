Females can mature eggs successively throughout almost their entire life, but in most terebrantian thrips spermiogenesis is complete by adult male eclosion, and testes contain only mature spermatids. In parasitoid wasps this phenomenon of preadult spermiogenesis is described as prospermatogeny. It is unclear if prospermatogeny and this predetermined sperm quantity have implications for mating strategy and fitness. In this study, we give a detailed description of mating behavior of the thripine species Echinothrips americanus, which largely corresponds with the only available data of another species of this family, Frankliniella occidentalis (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). With investigations using light microscopy, we describe for the first time the chronological sequence of internal processes during copulation.
