This assessment indicates that Plesiothrips shares more character states with genera from Southeast Asia, including the Trichromothrips genus\u2010group, than with any New World Thripinae. Sorghothrips sakagami (Kudo) comb. n. is removed from Plesiothrips; Taeniothrips aberrans Crawford syn. n. is considered a new synonym of Plesiothrips amblycauda Hood; and an illustrated identification key is given to 16 Plesiothrips species for which females are known."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:WHdLCjDvYFkC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17065649356626898906", "cites_id": ["17065649356626898906"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aen.12198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2q8eE6xd1ewJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
