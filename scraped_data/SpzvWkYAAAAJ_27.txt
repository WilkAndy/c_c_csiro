The genus Scirtothrips Shull includes several species that are serious agricultural pests, and, because of their minute size and cryptic behavior, prone to undetected transport through international trade of plant material. Although assigning specimens to the genus Scirtothrips is straightforward using traditional taxonomic methods, identification of species is much more difficult and requires expert knowledge of the genus. Furthermore, the validity of some Scirtothrips species is questionable. Therefore, an easy, accurate, and highly reliable technique is desirable for Scirtothrips identification. Here, we provide a simple molecular key based on the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12641310892443424898", "cites_id": ["12641310892443424898"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/99/5/1813/2218655", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gthdt0f1bq8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 4, "2011": 14, "2012": 10, "2013": 7, "2014": 11, "2015": 17, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 7, "2020": 13, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
