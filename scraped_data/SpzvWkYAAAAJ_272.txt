Neither of these extremes meets the needs of contemporary biologists in furthering our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of biological diversity. Part of the reason for these extremes is our failure to define suitable objectives for taxonomy. Instead of emphasising the units of biological diversity, we should concentrate on investigating patterns, structural, biological, ecological, temporal, and geographical, because it is these patterns that will generate novel ideas about the evolutionary history of organisms, and that will be most likely to be of interest to the future of our own species. To investigate these patterns, we need to give greater thought to ensuring that our methods of data acquisition are consistent with our methods of data analysis. Even if we take seriously as our objective the description of all living species, then we should be devising methods of sampling natural diversity that are statistically acceptable, not haphazard. However, the following comments, credited to Willis Jepson (1867-1946) in the latest edition of the Jepson Manual of Higher Plants of California, seem appropriate to our problems as insect taxonomists: \"The botanist's objective is a furtherance of knowledge of living plants. He wishes to discover new facts and establish new principles. If wise, he will never try to produce a work which is perfect, complete and final. Any such work would be a paradox and at cross purposes with our knowledge of living things and our ideas of endless evolution \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8704693099583152623", "cites_id": ["8704693099583152623"], "pub_url": "https://www.scielo.br/j/aseb/a/4ZygfMg3kcchzHTHtmCW5cS/abstract/?lang=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:76FyL0FIzXgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 3, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
