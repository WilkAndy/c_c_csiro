Four genera are placed in synonymy with Sophiothrips Hood (Nanothrips Faure; Zaxenothrips Crawford; Bagnalliola Priesner;Nanimothrips zur Strassen) as a result of studies on three new species. Two of these (aleurodisci and duvali) comprise a new species\u2010group endemic to New Zealand; the third (greensladei) is found in Australia and New Zealand but is closely related to species from the Azores and Southern France,"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1513768084673209484", "cites_id": ["1513768084673209484"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3113.1982.tb00451.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jCRFfw38ARUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 1, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
