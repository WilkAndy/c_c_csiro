Of these, 850 refer to currently accepted genera, including 65 genera of fossils. A further 420 genus-group names are placed in synonymy. Of the currently accepted genera 474 have been described since 1950. Despite this descriptive activity, the supra-generic classification of Thysanoptera genera remains poorly structured with relationships largely obscure and 50% of the genera monobasic."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ymY9cBF3mdcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17258901394583056380", "cites_id": ["17258901394583056380"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/megataxa/article/view/megataxa.6.1.2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_O-ddWDvg-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 5}}
