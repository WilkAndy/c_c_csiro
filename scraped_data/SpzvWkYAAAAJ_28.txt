Moreover, these vector species are not closely related to each other, suggesting either that many thrips species have lost an association with tospoviruses or that each Tospovirus species has evolved an independent relationship with a thrips species. The lack of evidence for a long evolutionary relationship between thrips and tospoviruses, together with the lack of any evidence that tospoviruses are associated with any native Australian plant species nor any native Australian thrips species, despite that continent being where TSWV was first observed, raise questions concerning where, when, how, and how often the thrips/tospovirus associations originated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10705289703536995436", "cites_id": ["10705289703536995436"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rita-Marullo/publication/281003047_Thrips_and_Tospoviruses_Proceedings_of_the_7th_International_Symposium_on_Thysanoptera/links/562bf1e808aef25a2441cda7/Thrips-and-Tospoviruses-Proceedings-of-the-7th-International-Symposium-on-Thysanoptera.pdf#page=15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bCz4LETUkJQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 9, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 9, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 3, "2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 2, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 6}}
