Their gut contents are commonly blue-green, suggesting that they possibly feed on blue-green algae. Three species of Lissothrips are known from New Zealand, of which two are here recorded from Australia together with six new species. Williamsiella is recorded from Australia for the first time, with one new species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14920030200472159230", "cites_id": ["14920030200472159230"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3946.3.4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_kM-6WqYDs8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
