These species appear to be members of the breviceps species-group from the Old World tropics. One of these five is particularly unusual within the genus in that the maxillary stylets are retracted into the head anterior to the postoccipital ridge. A sixth new species is described from Australia that is known only from Norfolk Island, but this is closely related to two species that are endemic to New Zealand. A key is provided to the nine species recognised."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3670911369342322588", "cites_id": ["3670911369342322588"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3860.2.5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nIeX63Cy8TIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
