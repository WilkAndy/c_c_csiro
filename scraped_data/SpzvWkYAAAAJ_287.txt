The leaves involved are of Catha edulis (Celastraceae), a plant that is used as a mild stimulant, particularly in countries near the Horn of Africa between Kenya and the Yemen. The leaves are either chewed fresh or made into a beverage, and the plant is commonly known as \u201ckhat\u201d or \u201cqat\u201d. Leaves of this plant imported into Australia have been found commonly to bear larvae and pupae, and more rarely adults, of an interesting species of Thripinae. Although clearly a member of the Scirtothrips genus-group (Masumoto & Okajima, 2007), the species represents a previously undescribed genus. The host range of this species is at present unknown, however Dr Subramanian Sevgan of ICIPE, Kenya, kindly e-mailed photomicrographs of this thrips (19 May 2009) and confirmed that the species had been collected from Catha edulis in that country. Although possibly host specific, this new species must continue to be considered a potential hazard by Australian quarantine, because so many species of Scirtothrips are highly polyphagous and pestiferous. Moreover, on the same imported leaves larvae and adults of a Scirtothrips species also have been taken several times, but this species remains unidentifiable due to the absence of any modern information on the African fauna of Scirtothrips. This article describes the new genus and species, with comparisons to related taxa. Nomenclatural details of all taxa mentioned here are given in the web-available world catalogue of Thysanoptera \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=65024661284133105", "cites_id": ["65024661284133105"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2210.1.4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8Rh7vZUD5wAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
