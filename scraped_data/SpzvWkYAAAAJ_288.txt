The genus is here newly recorded from Australia, with P.\u2003timonii sp. n. found breeding on the leaves of Timonius timon (Rubiaceae) at Broome on the north\u2010western coast. Immature stages fed on younger leaves, and, when disturbed, older larvae exuded an anal droplet. Adults were found mainly on mature leaves, where they exhibited the typically defensive behaviour of raising their heavily spined abdominal apex over the head. The new species is described and a key provided to the six known species of Panchaetothrips, although the identity of two South\u2010east Asian species remains in doubt."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8468266157860038492", "cites_id": ["8468266157860038492"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2004.00401.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XKe1KjRThXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
