The previously undescribed species of thrips, Trichromothrips veversae sp.n. (Thripidae), is widespread and locally abundant in southern Australia breeding on the youngest fronds of bracken but not on other ferns. It is unique among nearly 30 species of this Old World tropical genus in lacking long setae on the pronotum."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5837818130360757442", "cites_id": ["5837818130360757442"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.047116505335019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wux806gYBFEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
