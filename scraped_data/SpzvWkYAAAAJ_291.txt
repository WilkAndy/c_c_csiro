One of these species has apparently been widely dispersed by the horticultural trade. A. arorai Bhatti is widespread in India on Ficus religiosa, has been recorded as damaging young Ficus leaves in commercial nurseries in Florida, and is here recorded from northern Australia for the first time on cultivated Ficus species. A. discordiae Chen & Lu was described from Ficus septica in Taiwan. A. arafura sp. n. is described from Ficus opposita and F.? microcarpa on Melville and Bathurst Islands off the northern coast of Australia. The genus is redefined and compared with the worldwide genus Scirtothrips as well as the northern Australian genus Labiothrips, and a key is provided to the three species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18071844418617559160", "cites_id": ["18071844418617559160"], "pub_url": "http://entsocjournal.yabee.com.tw/AlldataPos/JournalPos/Vol20/No4/TESFE.2000030.PDF", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eEjT_78WzPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
