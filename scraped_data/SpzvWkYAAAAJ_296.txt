This species can be distinguished from other dark bodied, dark winged species in the same genus by the sculpture of the metanotum, the lack of sculpture on the pronotum, the short pronotal posteromarginal median setae, the relative positions of ocellar setae III and postocular setae I, the sharply paler basal area of the forewing, and the small round glandular areas on the male sternites. P. araucariae sp. nov. is described from male cones of Araucaria bidwilli in Queensland and was also collected from male catkins of A. heterophylla in Hawaii. This species is unique in the genus in having the pronotum weakly sculptured, the pronotal median posteromarginal setae well-developed, the basal 5th of the forewing gradually pale and the male sternal glandular areas transverse."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8574934770696178249", "cites_id": ["8574934770696178249"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19901148283", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Scp9871JAHcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
