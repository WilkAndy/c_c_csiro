In this respect, Anactinothrips species appear to be amongst the most highly evolved of all Thysanoptera. This Central and South American genus belongs in the Idolothripinae, a subfamily of Phlaeothripidae (Tubulifera) of which all the species feed on fungal spores (Mound and Palmer 1983). Hood (1950 b) described Anactinothrips borgmeieri as' gregarious' and he added that the adults' bring forth live young'. The few published references to viviparity in thrips are summarized by Lewis (1973), but preserved museum specimens are not infrequently found to contain an egg with a fully developed larva, and so the habit may be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9998796906774725613", "cites_id": ["9998796906774725613"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00222938300770601", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7QOVkc_cwooJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1}}
