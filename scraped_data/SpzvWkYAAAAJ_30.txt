These hypotheses are falsified when descriptions are found subsequently to apply to species which have already been described; they are synonymized. A substantial proportion of all descriptions are subject to synonymy. This has profound implications for the amount of effort necessary to establish a foundation of descriptions of a given proportion of the world\u2019s species, and hence for the practicality of some proposed responses to the biodiversity crisis. The patterns of synonymy of one order of insects, the Thysanoptera, through time and by authors, suggest some ways in which this problem may be reduced."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15618943839555531509", "cites_id": ["15618943839555531509"], "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.1993.0020", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9bJ7W6uiwdgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 9, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 2, "2006": 5, "2007": 3, "2008": 8, "2009": 0, "2010": 7, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 10, "2014": 7, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 6, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
