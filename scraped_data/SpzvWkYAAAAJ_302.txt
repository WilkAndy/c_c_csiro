Variation among specimens of the pest species on Ficus trees, the ficorum/uzeli complex, is examined with the conclusion that recognition of these two species remains questionable. Two species related to this complex are newly recorded from Australia, insulsus Priesner and luzonensis Priesner, and edentatus Priesner is placed as a syn. n. of ficorum. Two new Gynaikothrips are described, jasmini sp. n. and platypodae sp. n., and additamentus Karny is transferred from Gynaikothrips to Eilapinothrips gen. n. A new species of Agynaikothrips is described as the third known member of this genus, lorieni sp. n., and Liothrips umbratus Hood comb. rev. is returned to this original genus from Gynaikothrips. Two species described in Gynaikothrips from the Philippines, capitulatus Reyes and pedanus Reyes, are transferred to the genus Teuchothrips. The monobasic genus, Aiganothrips Bhatti, is considered a syn. n. of Gynaikothrips, and the monobasic genus, Jennythrips Bhatti, is considered a syn. n. of Liothrips."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:oTdOBqtIf_kC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7618884931970062965", "cites_id": ["7618884931970062965"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.5023.4.4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ddqmonq3u2kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 3}}
