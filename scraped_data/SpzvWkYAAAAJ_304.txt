Despite the relatively small numbers in this group, thrips, as they are normally known, have considerable impacts on human life. The range of the food crops that thrips damage is extensive, either as a result of plant cells killed when a thrips has sucked the contents, or as a result of tospovirus diseases that are transmitted and introduced into plants only by thrips. This chapter focuses on the species of Thysanoptera that are alive today. Within the Thysanoptera, two suborders are recognized, the Terebrantia and the Tubulifera, and there are considerable structural differences between the members of these two groups. For any bisexual organism, the first essential for maintaining a population is that the sexes meet and mate, and this subject area has produced some of the most interesting recent studies on thrips."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:NDuN12AVoxsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1434323545646846673", "cites_id": ["1434323545646846673"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118945582.ch18", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0VJCV6q95xMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
