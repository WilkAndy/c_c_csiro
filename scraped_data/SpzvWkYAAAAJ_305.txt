This trans\u2010Pacific dispersal presumably resulted from the international horticultural trade in Myoporum species. The data distinguish the pest from K.\u2009adelaideae sp.n. that induces leaf deformation on M.\u2009insulare along the coast of mainland Australia that is separated by \u223c300\u2009km from Tasmania by the Bass Strait. K.\u2009myopori is more damaging to its non\u2010native hosts in California and Hawai'i than to M.\u2009insulare in Tasmania, and further research is needed to determine if this is the result of release from its natural enemies. However, in certain areas of California, some Myoporum species are invasive weeds, and K.\u2009myopori may be considered an example of an accidental but beneficial introduction in this instance \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=110903167835782932", "cites_id": ["110903167835782932"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aen.12050", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FD9R89cBigEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1}}
