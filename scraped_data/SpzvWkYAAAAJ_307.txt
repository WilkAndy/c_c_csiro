The average number of thrips per gall, young leaves per plant, and bi-weekly rainfall peaked 3 times during the survey. The average number of living thrips per gall peaked about 4 wk after the peak in the number of young leaves per plant, and this occurred 2 to 4 wk after each rainfall peak. The thrips development time ranged from 17 to 25 d with an average of 20.8 d. Average adult longevity for female and male were 24.3 and 12.2 d, respectively. The number of eggs laid by a female ranged from 11 to 74 with an average of 41.5 eggs. An average of 94.9% of those eggs successfully hatched. One year after the initiation of the experiment, the thrips reduced the plant \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6168204764953700467", "cites_id": ["6168204764953700467"], "pub_url": "https://bioone.org/journals/Florida-Entomologist/volume-95/issue-3/024.095.0311/Seasonal-Abundance-and-Biology-of-iCrotonothrips-polyalthiae-i-Thysanoptera/10.1653/024.095.0311.short", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c-jvnI3dmVUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
