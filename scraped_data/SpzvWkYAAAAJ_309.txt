In another genus, Bhattithrips, a new species B. borealis is described from northern Australia, and the four members of this Australian genus are distinguished in a key. A species described from Southeast Asia, Astrothrips aureolus, is established and probably native to northern Australia, where it damages the leaves of an Hymenocallis cultivar (Amaryllidaceae)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15628611410816843104", "cites_id": ["15628611410816843104"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2292.1.3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YL1aMkb749gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
