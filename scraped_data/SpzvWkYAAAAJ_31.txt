The number of organisms involved, especially of fungi and insects, is almost incomprehensible, with 1.5 million and 6-80 million species, resp. In collecting and describing these, priority needs to be accorded to those of functional importance as' keystone'species. Reference collections which are permanently preserved are a crucial component of the information transfer system of biological diversity. They are essential for identification, as vouchers for the application of names, vouchers for species used in research projects, and are also databases themselves, incorporating a massive body of information on distribution, seasonality, etc. There is a need for world initiatives to harness this information. Collections can also provide the basis of training, can exchange specimens to assist new centres being established, and are well-suited to produce a wide variety of publications at different levels. The need to strengthen expertise in the developing countries is stressed, through cooperation with facilities already present in the developed world."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC", "num_citations": 102, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12532237534091692506", "cites_id": ["12532237534091692506"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19921161456", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2klafKNz660J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 5, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 5, "2000": 6, "2001": 2, "2002": 5, "2003": 5, "2004": 8, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 6, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 2, "2015": 6, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
