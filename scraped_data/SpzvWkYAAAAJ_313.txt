Females of Carcinothrips leai, the only previously described species, and also of a new species, Carcinothrips tania, secrete a ring of glue from their anus to fix together pairs of Acacia phyllodes. Adults and larvae live within the shallow cell so produced, and feed on the phyllode walls of their domicile."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1957675762189008392", "cites_id": ["1957675762189008392"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.1999.00076.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CP6qxrsPKxsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
