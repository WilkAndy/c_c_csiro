These insects feed on fungal spores and live among dead leaves or under bark, and although there are no recorded observations of them in life it is likely that they can fly readily, as do the related species of Idolothrips and Kleothrips in bright sunshine in Australia.Five species have been described in the genus, although simplex Bagnall is at present placed in Kleothrips. The other four nominal species have never been compared with one another directly and during a study of thrips material from the Solomon Islands and Northern Australia it became apparent that the published distinctions between these forms were not valid. This was largely because the original description and figures of the type-species of the genus were based on a dry carded unique and were less than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2975043324598082273", "cites_id": ["2975043324598082273"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00222937100770211", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4doQKiR6SSkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1974": 1, "1975": 0, "1976": 0, "1977": 0, "1978": 0, "1979": 1, "1980": 1, "1981": 0, "1982": 0, "1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 0, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
