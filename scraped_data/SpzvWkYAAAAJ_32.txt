Two varieties are widely grown; in the northern part of the area the high quality Sakel variety Bar 14/25, a bacterial blight-resistant derivative of Domains Sakel, and over most of the remainder a Lambert variety, Bar XLI, which is resistant also to leaf curl virus. There are two major insect pests, the jassid Empoasca lybica (de Berg.)(Cicadellid\u00e6), and the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.)(Aleyrodid\u00e6), and accounts of recent work on these can be found in Progress Reports of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation. In view of the expense of applying insecticides to the Gezira crop as is done at present, considerable attention has been given to the production of hairy-leaved cottons which are known to support a lower jassid population than do similar glabrous varieties. However, a serious objection to these hairy varieties has arisen in that they are subject to much more severe attacks of whitefly than are their glabrous relatives. The following account is of an investigation into the reasons for the greater numbers of whitefly on hairy plants."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 99, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=233247652222774432", "cites_id": ["233247652222774432"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=233247652222774432&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oKxu_4CpPAMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1982": 1, "1983": 1, "1984": 1, "1985": 1, "1986": 3, "1987": 1, "1988": 2, "1989": 2, "1990": 1, "1991": 4, "1992": 2, "1993": 2, "1994": 4, "1995": 7, "1996": 5, "1997": 1, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 3, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 3, "2011": 3, "2012": 6, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 2}}
