Plesiopsothrips zurstrasseni Bournier et al. is considered a new synonym of C. hargreavesi, and Plesiopsothrips carvalhoi Bournier a new synonym of C. xanthocerus. One oriental species, C. antennalis Karny, is newly recorded from Australia. Little is known of the biology of most species, but C. antennatus and C. xanthocerus are both recorded in association with Hemileia vastatrix on the leaves of Coffea species (Rubiaceae) in Africa, C. minor is recorded from flowers of Cassia (Fabaceae), and C. antennalis is recorded from plants of the family Apocynaceae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2418791338300536106", "cites_id": ["2418791338300536106"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3478.1.7", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KvUxKehFkSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
