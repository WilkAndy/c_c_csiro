The above-ground plant structures were sampled when each species was flowering yielding adults of polyphagous species of the common flower thrips Frankliniella tritici (Fitch), Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), and Microcephalothrips abdominalis (Crawford). There is little indication that the orchids were reproductive hosts of these species. Other species of thrips that are more host-specific to orchids were collected and included adults of the orchid-living species Aurantothrips orchidaceus (Bagnall) and Pseudothrips beckhami Beshear and Howell. The presence of larvae of P. beckhami indicated the suitability of at least some orchid species as reproductive hosts. The adults of 2 predatory species in the Family Phlaeothripidae also were collected, Leptothrips mali(Fitch) and Karnyothrips melaleucus (Bagnall)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6693782750167192273", "cites_id": ["6693782750167192273"], "pub_url": "https://meridian.allenpress.com/jes/article-abstract/42/4/573/77441", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0VJaM_IX5VwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1}}
