To confirm this remarkably disparate pair of host associations many other plants in these rainforests were examined. This new species was not found on any other plant, although about 40 thrips species were taken from the leaves of 40 plant species in 22 families, and these records are tabulated. Neohoodiella is known previously only from a single species in New Caledonia. The genus is characterised by the two character states: abdominal tube one third of body length; dorsal setae elongate but broadly capitate. The head of N. jennibeardae bears a bifurcate tubercle that is unique amongst Phlaeothripidae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3450012690528011791", "cites_id": ["3450012690528011791"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.151740638949812", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DwaDWUPo4C8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
