Local populations of Frankliniella fusca within peanut (Arachis hypogaea) fields can build to very great levels, and epidemics of tomato spotted wilt virus are common. A parasitic nematode, Thripinema fuscum, was discovered in F. fusca in 1995. In subsequent years, we have monitored populations of F. fusca, the percent of thrips parasitized, and the incidence of tomato spotted wilt virus while varying aspects of production. In all circumstances declines in numbers of larval thrips were observed as parasitism of F. fusca by T. fuscum increased.Momol, and Gorbet unpublished). Thripinema fuscum has been observed also at other times of the year, in F. fusca collected from wild host plants and other cultivated host plants, including winter wheat. Occasionally, F. fusca males have been observed to be infected with nematodes; other thrips species that are occasionally collected from peanut flowers including"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:rLGzs9wiiwIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6508749434280624572", "cites_id": ["6508749434280624572"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamito-Sakurai/publication/267328098_REGGIO_E/links/544ab5840cf2d6347f401ee3/REGGIO-E.pdf#page=141", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vEFSKiC5U1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
