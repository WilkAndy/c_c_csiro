Male cones support large populations of a host-specific thrips, Cycadothrips albrechti n.sp. (Thysanoptera, Aeolothripidae). This insect breeds only in these male cones, from which the adults swarm in late afternoon as the temperature falls and humidity rises. A small sticky trap at one female cone caught 3844 adults on a single afternoon; large numbers of thrips were observed entering this cone. Each thrips carried an average of 15 pollen grains, and pollen delivery into the cone was thus estimated to average more than 5500 grains per ovule. No other potential pollinators were found on these cycads, and it is concluded that C. albrechti is the sole pollinator of M. macdonnellii. Since Cycadothrips constitutes a basal clade within the Thysanoptera, the possibility is considered that thrips were involved in pollen transfer before the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:CYCckWUYoCcC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1734389226547530936", "cites_id": ["1734389226547530936"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1734389226547530936&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uEyh9s_JERgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
