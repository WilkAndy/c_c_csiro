Two of these species are from western U.S.A. but the third is from southern Europe. This discontinuous distribution, also similar distribution patterns amongst other taxa in the basal clades of the Thysanoptera which involve the five areas of the world with a Mediterranean climate, is discussed. The systematic significance of the duplicated antennal sensoria found in Orothrips species is briefly discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9184559823531050827", "cites_id": ["9184559823531050827"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/25010041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S4fkY38cdn8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
