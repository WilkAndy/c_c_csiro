Two species are known from Australia, one from New Zealand but the fourth is known from both countries. These thrips are apparently fungus-feeding, two being associated with the dead twigs of Leptospermum species. The significance of the distribution of these insects and their host plants on both sides of the Tasman Sea is discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:F9fV5C73w3QC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14358940320087298501", "cites_id": ["14358940320087298501"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222938200770251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xVHW6SQ0RccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1983": 1, "1984": 0, "1985": 0, "1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1}}
