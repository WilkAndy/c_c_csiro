A further six species are listed as incertae sedis within Xylaplothrips and a key is provided to the four species of this genus known from Australia including X. anarsius sp. n. The genus Mesandrothrips is recalled from synonymy with Xylaplothrips, and a list is provided of 20 appropriately included species of which 14 are new combinations from Xylaplothrips (M. caliginosus; M. clavipes; M. darci; M. dubius; M. emineus; M. flavitibia; M. flavus; M. inquilinus; M. montanus; M. pictipes; M. pusillus; M. reedi; M. subterraneus; M. tener), and one is a new combination from Haplothrips (M. inquinatus). A key is provided to 10 species of this genus known from Australia, including three species transferred from Haplothrips, together with M. austrosteensia sp. n., M. googongi sp. n., M. kurandae sp. n., M. lamingtoni sp. n. and M. oleariae sp. n. The type species, M. inquilinus, is widespread across Southeast Asia as an invader of thrips galls, and Haplothrips darci Girault based on a single female from Queensland is considered closely related."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16273924452590008749", "cites_id": ["16273924452590008749"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4613.2.6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rbkrEhGY2OEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
