The food plants, habitat and distribution of thrips species were recorded in both bioclimatic regions of Navarre. Five species are recorded for the first time from the Iberian Peninsula. This paper represents the first contribution to the knowledge of the fauna of the order Thysanoptera in Navarre."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13822065801434408086", "cites_id": ["13822065801434408086"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001106191", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lqSSLJ3X0b8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
