The characters by which this group may be distinguished, and the level at which the group should be classified, family, sub-family, tribe or genus- group, are discussed. It is concluded that recognition of the group at supra-generic level is not useful because it renders the rest of Phlaeothripidae paraphyletic."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15841195600932014121", "cites_id": ["15841195600932014121"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03946975.1997.10539335", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KYgIA3g719sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1}}
