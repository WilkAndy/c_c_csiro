Recognition of holophyletic genera in such groups is difficult. Large monothetically defined genera are often not holophyletic, whilst small genera need to be defined by a large and invariable character\u2010suite. Any classification produced by adopting small genera will not possess one of the valuable attributes of the classical Linnaean system, its predictive ability; a large proportion of new species will require new genera. For groups exhibiting a high degree of homoplasy it is suggested that a polythetic classification be erected. Polythetic genera can be holophyletic groups and are not merely phenetic assemblages.
