It is now established, as they point out, that'real'biodiversity is the consequence of diverse interactions between individuals within biological populations, their environments and anthropic factors.But Rivera-Nunez and Ob6n-de-Castro continue by criticizing the established, ex situ biodiversity conservation paradigm or, as they see it, the\" armchair, molecular-biased approach\". They favour wildlife preservation by monitoring of endangered species and the establishment of in situ reserves and they say that local landrace material cannot be stored without an understanding of the conscious and unconscious processes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:U_HPUtbDl20C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4073493969026810002", "cites_id": ["4073493969026810002"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/361579b0.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kgCKui71hzgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
