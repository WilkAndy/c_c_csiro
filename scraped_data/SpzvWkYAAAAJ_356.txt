Scirtothrips genus-group comprises 11 genera, but phylogenetic relationships among these are unclear, as are the interspecific relationships within Scirtothrips. We used 61 morphological characters to study the morphological variation and phylogenetic relationships among the members of this genus-group. Phylogenetic analysis supported the inclusion of eight genera in Scirtothrips genus-group but excluded Ajothrips and Scirtidothrips, although the monophyly of Scirtothrips was not well-supported. Our analysis strongly supported two different species-groups both comprising species associated with Acacia in Australia, suggesting the occurrence of at least two separate radiations onto this plant genus. The monophyly of Scirtothrips perseae species-group was not supported \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15012567252873278317", "cites_id": ["15012567252873278317"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044523119300270", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bXMsYmBaV9AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 3}}
