It is the eleventh species in this genus to be recorded from a species of bamboo, but only the fourth of these 11 species to have a prominent spinula on the mesothoracic furca. Described here from New Zealand, this thrips is presumably introduced from Southeast Asia, together with its host plant, Phyllostachys aurea."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3655762152635186627", "cites_id": ["3655762152635186627"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4323.2.13", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wz0jC0_guzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
