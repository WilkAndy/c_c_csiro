The descriptions were published long before any studies on the biology and structural variation of fungus-feeding Phlaeothripinae. Ten of these species are here placed into synonymy, and doubts are expressed concerning the identity of some others. One new polymorphic species is described and compared to a species known only from Florida. In the absence of comprehensive studies on the Hoplothrips fauna of North America, there is little evidence of endemicity or radiation on Hawaii within this genus."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3817783031493003656", "cites_id": ["3817783031493003656"], "pub_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5740468/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iImnjXB9-zQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3}}
