In the genus Azaleothrips one new species is described, and one Asian species is newly recorded from Australia. The genus Stictothrips is recorded from Australia for the first time, with two new species. Within the genus Strepterothrips considerable structural diversity is recorded including three new species in which antennal segment III is greatly reduced and bears no sense cones. Some species in this genus exhibit the unusual condition of having several setae on the pelta, the first abdominal tergite. Problems in the production of generic diagnoses within the Phlaeothripinae are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5066749922493794052", "cites_id": ["5066749922493794052"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4034.2.5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:BAf7rzW2UEYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3}}
