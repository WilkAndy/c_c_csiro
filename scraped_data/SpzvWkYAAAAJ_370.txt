Of these, 91 species are recorded from the Oriental and Pacific Regions (Palmer, 1992), and an identification key is available to the 23 species known from Peninsular Malaysia (Mound & Azidah, 2009). In the latter paper, the authors described one new species and recorded seven species as new records for the area, and these totals suggest that many more species are likely to occur here."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16099624495256894888", "cites_id": ["16099624495256894888"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2638.1.4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qP320C1bbd8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
