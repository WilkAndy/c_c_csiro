This species, Australothrips aliceae, was found at sites near Darwin, Northern Territory on the leaves of Calytrix brownii (Myrtaceae). It is of systematic interest because it approaches in structure the members of the palaeotropical genus Phibalothrips Hood that live only on grasses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1432805066460559812", "cites_id": ["1432805066460559812"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.1997.tb01458.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xPnC2p1Y4hMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
