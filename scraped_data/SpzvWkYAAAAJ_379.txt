Only a few records exist of any members of the group outside this area, these being from the Pacific Islands and Eastern Asia. No account seems to have been given of the development or biology of any member of the group, although morphologically they are without doubt the most interesting and largest of the Whiteflies. A. capiangae was described by Bondar (1923) from a plant referred to as\" Capianga\". This apparently is Visraia brasiliensis Chois. Large numbers of this whitefly were found on Canna indica at St. Augustine, Trinidad, in 1959. The attack was restricted to~ few leaves of a few plants, a not uncommon situation with whiteflies. No males at all were collected or bred out, although about four hundred adults were examined. The pupae were parasitized by Coccophagus aleurodici Girault, as few as l0 per cent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5800588558332685424", "cites_id": ["5800588558332685424"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00222936108651115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cGydm4_Uf1AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 1, "1988": 0, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1}}
