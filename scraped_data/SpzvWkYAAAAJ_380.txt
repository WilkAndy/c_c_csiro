However, our current understanding of the biology and potential of these thrips as biological control agents is insufficient, limiting our understanding of their role in pest management. This paper assesses published information on the diversity of predatory thrips and the available biological data on their diet breadth. About 100 species within three different families \u2013 Aeolothripidae, Phlaeothripidae and Thripidae \u2013 seem likely to be predatory, although some conclusions are speculative. Both facultative and obligate predators can be found among the species with prey records. Obligate predators feed primarily on arthropod tissues, whereas facultative predators consume plant tissues in addition to prey.
