This thrips is similar in appearance to the smaller species of the genus Kladothrips that induce galls on Acacia species. The galls are invaded by a phytophagous kleptoparasitic thrips, Pharothrips hynnis gen. et sp. n., females of which have a forked plough-like structure protruding ventrally on the frons that is unique amongst Thysanoptera."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:X0DADzN9RKwC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7968158696472632762", "cites_id": ["7968158696472632762"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4759.3.8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ut0wCR6WlG4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 2}}
