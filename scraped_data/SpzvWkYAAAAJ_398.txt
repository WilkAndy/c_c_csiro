This sexual dimorphism, involving male allometry and probably male competition, is apparently plesiomorphic in the genus. Reasons are given for considering the typical condition found in neotropical Macrophthalmothrips species, with both sexes having similar slender fore legs, to be apomorphic. The sister species of kiesteri is considered to be allops Hood from Belem, and these two with diasi Hood from Sao Paulo comprise a distinctive species-group."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12255137915954945683", "cites_id": ["12255137915954945683"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222938700771011", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k17qCQH_EqoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
