Nomenclatural changes introduced here are 10 new generic and 10 new specific synonymies, together with 23 new combinations, seven new replacement names for junior homonyms and one revived original combination. Three subfamilial names are available in the Aleyrodidae, most species being placed in the Aleyrodinae or Aleurodicinae. The controversial third subfamily, Udamoselinae, is briefly discussed. For species currently regarded as valid, only the original and current combinations are given, with authorities. Original countries of description are given, here updated to reflect current geopolitical boundaries, but distributions and biological data are not given. An index to all names is provided."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC", "num_citations": 332, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16792310875535019043", "cites_id": ["16792310875535019043"], "pub_url": "https://www.mapress.com/zt/article/view/3336", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I4wxlsVFCukJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 12, "2009": 12, "2010": 18, "2011": 10, "2012": 19, "2013": 26, "2014": 23, "2015": 22, "2016": 28, "2017": 21, "2018": 27, "2019": 26, "2020": 27, "2021": 24, "2022": 20, "2023": 10}}
