We used data from two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I and 16S rDNA), adult morphology and behavior, and gall morphology to infer a phylogeny forAcaciagall-forming thrips with and without soldiers, and we used this phylogeny to evaluate hypotheses concerning soldier evolution. Phylogenies inferred from each data set analyzed separately yielded large numbers of most-parsimonious trees and weak support for most nodes. However, when analyzed together the data sets complemented and reinforced one another in such a way as to yield a well-resolved phylogeny. Our phylogeny implies that soldiers originated once or twice early in the history of this clade, that soldiers were lost once or twice \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 82, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10729273664186233558", "cites_id": ["10729273664186233558"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790397904498", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1jLGK40J5pQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 2, "1999": 6, "2000": 10, "2001": 7, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 6, "2005": 0, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
