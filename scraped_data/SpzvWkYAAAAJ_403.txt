It has a rich endemic flora involving more than 5000 plant species (Endemia. nc 2021; Guillaumin 1948), but the only account of the Thysanoptera fauna apart from some new species descriptions is a check-list of 44 genera and 68 species (Bournier & Mound 2000). Here we describe a new monotypic genus of Panchaetothripinae that has been collected twice in New Caledonia, in 1992 and 2012, but without any information on possible host associations. This genus shares character states with a monobasic genus from New Zealand, but more particularly with a genus of four species endemic to Australia. The Thripidae fauna of New Zealand appears to be well-studied (Mound et al. 2017), with only one or two undescribed species known in collections. The Australian Thysanoptera fauna has also been studied extensively in the past 20 years (Mound & Tree 2020), and few undescribed species of Thripidae are known. In contrast, the Thysanoptera fauna of New Caledonia appears to be largely unexplored, and description here of this new genus serves to emphasize the uniqueness of this fauna. Photographs of the habitus and morphological characters were taken on the technical platform at CBGP (Centre de Biologie pour la Gestion des Populations) using a KEYENCE\u00ae VHX-5000 digital microscope and a Leica DM5500, and at CSIRO, Canberra using a Leica DM2500 with Nomarski illumination."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8432212407618191325", "cites_id": ["8432212407618191325"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arturo-Goldarazena/publication/353680394_Pennathrips_Thysanoptera_Thripidae_a_new_panchaetothripine_genus_from_New_Caledonia/links/610a4522169a1a0103db107e/Pennathrips-Thysanoptera-Thripidae-a-new-panchaetothripine-genus-from-New-Caledonia.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3T-5SoI8BXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
