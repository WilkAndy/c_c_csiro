Most of these live on dead branches of woody angiosperm trees and are presumed to feed on fungal hyphae or their liquid breakdown products (Kobro & Rafoss 2006). Many species in this genus exhibit considerable sexual dimorphism, also considerable polyphenism associated with variation in body size. As a result of this variation in body structure, species identification in this genus is often difficult (Mound & Walker 1986; Mound 2017; Mound et al. 2018)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2233694435385535855", "cites_id": ["2233694435385535855"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4758.3.12", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b-3rHUGt_x4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
