Austrothrips flavitibia Moulton is transferred to the genus Teuchothrips and Austrothrips vanuaensis Moulton is transferred to the genus Solomonthrips. The gall-inducing Austrothrips cochinchinensis Karny is transferred to Ocnothrips as a senior synonym of the type species, O. indicus. The host of cochinchinensis is recognised as a vine-like shrub, Getonia floribunda, that is widespread between western India and southeast China."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9705945212133811510", "cites_id": ["9705945212133811510"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4755.3.10", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NqWjAr9xsoYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
