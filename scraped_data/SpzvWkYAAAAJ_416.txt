Thus, following the results of this analysis, we propose the transference of the first two genera to subfamily Panchaetothripinae, under the tribe Monilothripini."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:ghEM2AJqZyQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1246960558976676591", "cites_id": ["1246960558976676591"], "pub_url": "https://europepmc.org/article/med/31716077", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7zK6jgUYThEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 2}}
