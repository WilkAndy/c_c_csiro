This species has exceptionally reduced sclerotisation rendering systematic comparisons of the new genus difficult. The cylindrical form of the eighth antennal segment is unique in the family, and the compound eyes are not developed on the ventral surface of the head.\u2752 Thysanoptera, Tubulifera, Phlaeothripidae, Phlaeothripinae, bark spray.There are many reasons for a time lag between a species being collected and being formally described, but two are particularly important in our studies on insects of the Order Thysanoptera. When first collected, species exhibiting particularly unusual character states are often represented only by single individuals, and possible reasons for this are discussed below. However, efforts to locate a representative population of such a species, or at least a few more individuals, can lead to considerable delays. Equally important is that of the 365 genera of extant species in the major subfamily Phlaeothripinae 45% are monobasic, and we consider it prudent to hesitate before adding to this lack of phylogenetic structure (Buckman et al. 2013). The taxon described below is an example of this situation. Despite being collected at a site to which much collecting activity has been directed in recent years, only one wingless female has been found. The structure of this female is so remarkable, with extreme"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3329080415997326083", "cites_id": ["3329080415997326083"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurence-Mound/publication/292854494_Leichhardt's_vanishing_thrips_A_remarkable_new_genus_and_species_of_Insecta_Thysanoptera_Phlaeothripinae/links/5733a47008ae9f741b2617d0/Leichhardts-vanishing-thrips-A-remarkable-new-genus-and-species-of-Insecta-Thysanoptera-Phlaeothripinae.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A_M6CABFMy4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
