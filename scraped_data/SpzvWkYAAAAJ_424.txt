Paspalum notatum Flugge and Paspalum distichum L. (Poales: Poaceae) are low-maintenance, warm-climate, tolerant grasses that are used for pasture and residential lawns and along roadsides. The potential of P. notatum and P. distichum to serve as sources of the common polyphagous Frankliniella thrips in the southeastern United States was evaluated. The abilities of F. fusca, F. occidentalis, and F. tritici to survive and reproduce on vegetative-stage P. distichum, P. notatum \u2018Argentine\u2019, P. notatum \u2018Pensacola\u2019, and P. notatum \u2018Tifton 9\u2019 were compared in laboratory no-choice tests. Survival of the adults of each thrips species was \u224820% after 12 d on each of the Paspalum treatments.
