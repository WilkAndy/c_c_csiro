Between the years 1950 and 1980, according to cataloguing efforts by JS Bhatti (2004), TNA was responsible, either as sole or joint author, for erecting 76 new genus-group names and 320 species-group names. This is a monumental effort, involving great energy, determination, scholarship\u2013and considerable financial investment. Modern biology involves many different study areas, from molecules to ecosystems, and the available pool of research workers and research funding is inevitably limited. There is thus competition between subjects for attention and financial support, and descriptive taxonomy is one area where funding has fallen over the past 50 years, as reflected in the number of experienced practitioners. This is not the place to re-examine why this should have happened. However, the opportunity is taken here to consider the objectives of insect taxonomists, and in particular how taxonomic studies on thrips generally have been approached. Unless we have a clear idea of what we as taxonomists want to achieve, of how we will achieve it, and for whose benefit, we can expect the rest of the biological community and its funding agencies to treat our studies as of limited priority.Taxonomy is commonly perceived as being about naming and describing things, and many students seem to be taught this narrow view. But the purpose of taxonomy extends beyond describing and cataloguing. By examining the patterns of diversity, taxonomy is an essential tool in helping us to investigate how \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6506336600620116812", "cites_id": ["6506336600620116812"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oro4DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA60&dq=info:TKsVjaomS1oJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3qHvZ2rBLJ&sig=UqPFUVTUa86sTIq6bsCwY-rG5II", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TKsVjaomS1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
