Imagine the field of entomology in 1878 when he was born, and the great body of work he accomplished as Florida established agriculture and associated pest management capabilities. For perspective, he was almost 20 years old when the battleship Maine exploded in Havana Harbor signaling the beginning of the Spanish American War. It was not until the turn of the century that the US Army Yellow Fever Commission, headed by Walter Reed, proved that yellow fever was a viral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti. Soon thereafter, on January 5, 1916, the Florida Entomological Society was established with JR Watson as president and Wilmon Newell the secretary-treasurer. Newell had recently been appointed Plant Commissioner of the Florida State Plant Board, created in 1915 initially to eradicate citrus canker. He directed the first Mediterranean fruit fly eradication campaign in 1929-30, and was instrumental in successfully eliminating citrus canker from Florida in the early 1930s. This Florida pioneer entomologist cooperatively accomplished these extraordinary pest management feats before the era of synthetic chemical pesticides. To provide an historical perspective for Dr. Newell\u2019s distinguished career, John T. Creighton wrote his obituary for the Journal of Economic Entomology in 1943, himself honored as a Florida Entomological Society Pioneer in 2000. Wilmon Newell was born at Hull, Iowa on March 4, 1878, receiving his BS, MS, and honorary Sc. D. degrees from Iowa State College in 1897, 1898, and 1920 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5317958352504823555", "cites_id": ["5317958352504823555"], "pub_url": "https://journals.flvc.org/flaent/article/download/75433/73091", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ax9fI_IuzUkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1}}
