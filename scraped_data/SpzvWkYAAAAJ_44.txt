As a result, many\" host-plant\" records are no more than casual\" finding places\" with limited biological significance. Definitions of\" host-plant\" are complicated by situations where a plant species provides an important feeding or be havioral resource, but is not used for breeding. Similarly, failure to clearly define some structures on a thrips body, often due to inadequate technical and microscopy skills, can lead to faulty interpretation of species identities and evolutionary relationships. This article re-examines some of these problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C", "num_citations": 78, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16093514364275407820", "cites_id": ["16093514364275407820"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/23609314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zDtIFgymV98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 9, "2015": 13, "2016": 12, "2017": 8, "2018": 15, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 9}}
