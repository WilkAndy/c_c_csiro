Three of these species are shown to have a variable number of sense cones on antennal segment IV, in contrast to most recorded species in the Liothrips-lineage. One endemic species is removed from Teuchothrips and considered here as Neocecidothrips pacificus (Bianchi) comb.n. together with illustrations and diagnostic notes. A key is provided for the four Teuchothrips species known from New Caledonia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:YPNY0knpFBYC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3988400435014597891", "cites_id": ["3988400435014597891"], "pub_url": "https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/271129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:A_0ObxClWTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
