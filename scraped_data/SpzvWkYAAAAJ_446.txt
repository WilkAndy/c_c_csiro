Two distinct races are recognised, the \u2018tropical lowland\u2019       race (also known as the West Indian race) and the \u2018subtropical\u2019 race (Schaffer et al. 2013). The lowland race is tropical in adaptation, and widely grown in hot humid tropical and semi-tropical       areas. Subtropical races are from highland montane cloud forests in Mexico and Guatemala and are grown in warm to cool subtropical and Mediterranean climates. The \u2018Hass\u2019 cultivar is the       dominant subtropical variety grown globally (Schaffer et al. 2013)     "}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:37UQlXuwjP4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12199781047250776376", "cites_id": ["12199781047250776376"], "pub_url": "https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.4001/003.028.0195", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OPHsqjlUTqkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
