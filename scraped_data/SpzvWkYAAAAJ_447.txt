Corresponding with its presence in Australia has been an alteration of fire regimes and soil nutrients, and a reduction in floral diversity. We investigated whether buffel grass supported a less diverse community of thrips (order Thysanoptera) compared to the native grasses Cymbopogon ambiguus and Themeda triandra growing in Alice Springs, central Australia. The survey data showed that abundance was highest on buffel grass; however, the thrips community was almost entirely dominated by one species. The thrips communities on the native grasses were similar and markedly more diverse than that on buffel grass, both in terms of species richness and functional feeding groups. Flower feeders constituted the greatest proportion of thrips on all \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:yY3RG6sOEgwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6829642369827941972", "cites_id": ["6829642369827941972"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/jue/article-abstract/6/1/juaa024/6020144", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VC6N5IzDx14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
