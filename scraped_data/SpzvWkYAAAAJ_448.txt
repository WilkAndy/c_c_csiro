The original description was based on an unspecified number of syntypes, with no depositary indicated. However, one of the authors (R. Varatharajan) acquired four slides that are labelled by Ananthakrishnan as this species and bear the same collection details as given in the original description. These are assumed to be syntypes, and one female is here designated as lectotype. The other three slides are of males and are considered as paralectotypes. Further, during extensive surveys for thrips at Dampa Tiger Reserve, Mizoram (23.32 0 N 92.13 0 E) and Manipur University campus (24.82 0 N 93.90 0 E) during 2014\u201318, we have collected both sexes of this species from the leaves of Ficus curtipes. The freshly collected specimens were mounted onto microscope slides in Canada balsam, and identified using the keys provided by Ananthakrishnan and Sen (1980). Hence, the species is illustrated and re-described with additional features, based on the type material together with freshly collected specimens from north eastern India, Manipur and Mizoram.
