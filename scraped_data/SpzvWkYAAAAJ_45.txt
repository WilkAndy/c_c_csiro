Pollination by thrips (thripophily) appears more widespread in rainforest communities than has been previously recognized. The pollination ecology of Wilkiea huegeliana (Monimiaceae) was studied in detail. Wilkiea huegeliana is a small, unisexual, annually flowering tree or shrub of rainforest and associated ecotones in eastern Australia, and is a larval food plant for the Regent Skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia rafflesia (Hesperiidae). At this latitude W. huegeliana is pollinated solely by a species of thrips, Thrips setipennis, but T. setipennis is not restricted to W. huegeliana and was recorded from flowers of 13 rainforest plant species. It appears to be the obligate pollinator also for Rapanea howittiana \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11923489998641912119", "cites_id": ["11923489998641912119"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/002229301447853", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N1n5-_q-eKUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 4, "2003": 3, "2004": 6, "2005": 9, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
