Three new synonyms are established, and H. aliceae sp. n. is described from Sarawak, Timor-Leste and Thailand. In contrast to recent treatments of Haplothrips, one of the most common members of the genus in Australia, H. angustus Hood is recognised as a syn. n. of H. ganglebaueri Schmutz that is widespread from Iran to Indonesia. Difficulties in distinguishing between three of the most common flower-living, Southeast Asian, species of this genus are discussed: H. anceps Hood from northern Australia, H. chinensis Priesner from Hong Kong, and H. brevitubus (Karny) from Japan."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:RJOyoaXV5v8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9310533378331404465", "cites_id": ["9310533378331404465"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4623.1.3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:sWjcPMeoNYEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
