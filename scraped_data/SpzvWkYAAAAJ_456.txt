Puerto Avora: Charles Darwin Foundation", "abstract": "Thrips are tiny, slender insects with fringed wings. They feed on a large variety of both plants and animals by puncturing them and sucking their contents. Many are considered pests because they feed on plants with commercial value. Others feed on insects or mites and are therefore often considered beneficial. Still others feed on fungal spores or pollen. Around 5,000 species have thus far been described. They are generally tiny insects (In a 1967 survey of Galapagos thrips, three families, six genera, and eight species were recorded. Fifty species are currently known, of which 33 are described and nameable here. The Aeolothripidae is represented by one predaceous species; Merothripidae with one fungivorus species; Thripidae with 18 phytophagous species and 3 predaceous species; and the Phlaeothripidae with seven known phytophagous species and 19 species that feed on fungal hyphae or spores, on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10775423512677389964", "cites_id": ["10775423512677389964"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10775423512677389964&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jBaHGZj-iZUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
