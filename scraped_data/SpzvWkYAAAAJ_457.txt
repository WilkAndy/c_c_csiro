The breeding sites for other species in the genus remain unknown, but 16 species are here recognised from Australia, of which the following six are newly described: P. daguilaris, P. flindersi, P. kingae, P. kranzae, P. oakeyi, P. whyallae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3515822501574176130", "cites_id": ["3515822501574176130"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.3608.4.2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gm2nA_C1yjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1}}
