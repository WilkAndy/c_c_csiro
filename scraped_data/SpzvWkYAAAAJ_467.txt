Most naturalists, however, aware of the diversity of living organisms, are content to use the word in a broader sense. Entomologists in particular must bear in mind the recent suggestion by Terry Erwin in Coleopterists Bullelin that there may be as many as 30 million different species of living terrestrial arthropods, most of them in the tropics. Only when measuring or comparing \u2018diversity\u2019is a careful definition of this term required, a1 though unfortunately the biological and evolutionary relevance of the available \u2018indexes\u2019 are not always very clear. The papers in this volume were given at an invited Symposium at the First International Conference on Tropical Entomology, held in Nairobi in August 1986, and the approach adopted was deliberately diverse.The first two papers are concerned with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5471236161258966767", "cites_id": ["5471236161258966767"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/30/4/289/2676952", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:784cAk287UsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
