This conflict between present day availability and preservation for posterity is discussed with reference to general collections as well as primary types. Collections of biological specimens for reference purpose and taxonomic research are essentially archival material needing to be segregated from collections used for teaching or exhibitions purposes. As with all archival material reference specimens and primary types should be deposited where their long term preservation can be safely assured."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9436310541038648565", "cites_id": ["9436310541038648565"], "pub_url": "https://brill.com/view/journals/ise/9/3/article-p169_2.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9fzh_HCC9IIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
