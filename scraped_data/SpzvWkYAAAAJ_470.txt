Three new species are described in Baenothrips, a small but widespread genus of wingless, fungus-feeding species in the Old World tropics. Two new species of Scirtothrips are described that are members of a species-group breeding on the youngest fronds of tree ferns."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:QaSi33NTfwYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.5228.1.5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VPTL3IuR4jUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
