At first sight, the available data for India suggest that the Thysanoptera fauna is reasonably well known. Two recent checklists are available for the described members of this Order of insects (Tyagi & Kumar 2016; Rachana & Varatharajan 2017), and together these lists indicate that about 750 species of thrips in 260 genera are recorded from India. Indeed, as early as 1928 that great entomologist, TV Ramakrishna Ayyar, produced a 100-page summary of what was then known of the thrips of India. That publication indicated that 126 species of Thysanoptera were then known from India, having increased from a mere 14 species known in 1915 (Ramakrishna 1928). More recently, two further workers have made enormous contributions to our knowledge of this fauna: TN Ananthakrishnan emphasised the faunal richness by describing over 300 new species in about 70 new genus-group names, and JS Bhatti has added greatly to our knowledge of the taxonomy of these insects particularly through highly original and detailed accounts of their external morphology. Moreover, in recent years innovative contributions by K. Tyagi and her colleagues have emphasised the significance of DNA studies in thrips taxonomy (Tyagi et al., 2020). But how does all this taxonomic data contribute to our knowledge of biological diversity? The answer to that question depends on how one interprets those two words.To many people, including many taxonomists, biological diversity is measured in terms of taxon \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:kUhpeDhEZMUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://indianentomology.org/index.php/ije/article/download/598/553", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PvARHnoFi1EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
