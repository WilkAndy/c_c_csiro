(Thysanoptera, Phlaeothripinae) from New Guinea, with the tenth abdominal segment exceptionally long", "pub_year": 2021, "citation": "Zootaxa 5004 (3), 490-492, 2021", "author": "Laurence A Mound", "journal": "Zootaxa", "volume": "5004", "number": "3", "pages": "490-492", "abstract": "Species of Leeuwenia, an Old World tropical genus of leaf-feeding thrips, have been termed the \u201clong-tubed thrips\u201d, in view of the extraordinary length of their tenth abdominal segment (Mound 2004). Adults of these species sometimes raise the tube over the body and project it forwards over the head. The anus is at the apex of this tube, and exudates from the anus seem to be used by these insects as repellants when under threat (Suzuki et al. 1988; Mound & Tree 2021). The length of the tube varies greatly between species, from no more than five times its basal width in L. aliceae from Australia, to 22 times the basal width in L. arbastoae from the Philippines. The body-size of the species described below is about the same as that of arbastoae, but the tube is more slender and thus almost 25 times as long as its basal width. Among the 30 species of the genus Leeuwenia (ThripsWiki 2021) the host plants are not known for 12 species, but 11 are recorded from plants in the family Myrtaceae, and seven species are recorded each from one of seven other plant families (Mound 2004). The new species described here was found on the leaves of a species Schefflera, a genus in the family Araliaceae, thus further extending the range of plant families with which this thrips genus is associated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:orDZ08hpP44C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.5004.3.6/67774", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5i3vaFo8KGkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
