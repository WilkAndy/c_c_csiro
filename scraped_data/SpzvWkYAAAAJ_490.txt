Mate choice can benefit fecundity and survival of females, or have an indirect effect by providing optimal genes. Assortative mating by size is one of the most commonly observed sexual behaviors. Additionally, chemical cues may be detected by females, as these can also be indicators of body size and condition. Little is known about mate choice behavior among Thysanoptera. The mating system of Echinothrips americanus (Thysanoptera, Thripidae) is characterized by a strong competition for mates, leading to assortative mating. In this species very prominent gland structures are located on sternites III to VIII, of which the function still remains unknown. However, given the individual differences in expression of the gland release areas, a probable role in mate selection is postulated.
