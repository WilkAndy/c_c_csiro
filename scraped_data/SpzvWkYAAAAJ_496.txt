Tospoviruses does not have a long evolutionary history. Since tospoviruses are fully dependent for their existence on the few vector thrips species, the implication is that tospoviruses are a recent evolutionary phenomenon. The suggestion is made that variation in vector ability might be a more useful avenue for research than plant breeding to control these essentially vertebrate viruses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholars.tari.gov.tw/handle/123456789/5843", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:APCwk2Q04R0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
