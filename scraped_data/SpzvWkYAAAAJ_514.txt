Seven of these species are known from tropical areas to the north of Australia (Anaphothrips swezeyi Moulton; Bathrips melanicornis (Shumsher); Caprithrips orientalis Bhatti; Craspedothrips minor (Bagnall); Danothrips trifasciatus Sakimura; Mycterothrips nilgiriensis (Ananthakrishnan); Scolothrips asura Ramakrishna & Margabandhu). The other two have been collected on plant species also found in Asia (Mycterothrips desleyae Masumoto & Okajima; Pseudodendrothrips alexei sp. n.). These records further emphasise the difficulties of distinguishing between native and invasive thrips species in the northern Australian fauna."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:tz746QTLzJkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4280766834718382629&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JZqpdcFWaDsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
