In publishing that host record it was pointed out that a second, undescribed, species of Lomatothrips had been taken in southeastern Australia in association with P. lawrencei. The purposes of this to describe this second species, indicate its distribution and host range in Australia, and to discuss the distribution of the two Lomatothrips species in the light of Thysanoptera faunal relationships between New Zealand and southeastern Australia including Tasmania, these seeming to result more from recent dispersal than vicariance. A further purpose is to draw attention to how little is known of the native thrips fauna of Tasmania."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:RMgMIBzvq-4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5522057912488966635&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6zkKD2pKokwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
