Scirtothrips species occur mainly in the warmer parts of the world, and several of them are serious pests on a range of unrelated plants. The Californian citrus thrips, S. citri (Moulton), also the South African citrus thrips, S. aurantii Faure that has recently become established in Australia, are both well known for causing economically important damage to citrus fruit. Similarly, S. perseae Nakahara, a recently introduced pest of avocados in California, causes considerable financial losses due to fruit scarring as a result of feeding by adults and larvae (Hoddle et al., 2003). In contrast, S. dorsalis Hood is widespread and a frequent pest in countries between Pakistan, Japan and Australia, causing damage to many crops including chillies, tea, grapes, and strawberry plants. In addition to these major pests, several other Scirtothrips species have been recorded as damaging crop plants, either in tropical countries or under glass in temperate countries (Mound & Palmer, 1981). Worldwide, the number of described Scirtothrips species has more than doubled in the past 20 years. Bailey (1964) stated that the genus included 35 species, but this had increased to about 40 when Mound & Palmer (1981) provided a means of recognising the 10 major pest species in this genus. In contrast, with the 11 new species from Australia described here, the total number of described Scirtothrips is now over 100.
