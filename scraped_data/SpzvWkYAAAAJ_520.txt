The production of lists of described taxa should have high priority for insect taxonomic science, whether for a local fauna, such as the Lepidoptera of Australia (Nielsen and others 1996), or for the worldwide fauna of a particular group, such as Geometridae (Scoble 1999). Such lists provide some measure of what has been achieved at a given time. More important, they can be a means of stimulating further studies and of attracting research funding in other aspects of biology (Mound 1998). However, within the taxonomic community, tradition remains biased toward the production of scholarly nomenclatural catalogs, with details of type material that are useful only to other specialist taxonomists. Our use of the term checklist implies a product that can be used as the starting point for investigations into biological diversity by the biological and conservation community in general."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:bVQMTfhMCi4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6341768484144737424&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kOw2EdZ8AlgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
