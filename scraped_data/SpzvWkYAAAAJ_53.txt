These taxa belong to what, in recent literature, has been called the \u201cHaplothrips\u2010lineage\u201d, that is, one of the three major radiations among the 2700 species and 350 genera of Thysanoptera Phlaeothripinae. The group is redefined, and the available tribal name Haplothripini shown to be appropriate. The character states on which the definition is based are discussed, and a list given of the 34 genera worldwide that can be included. The Australian species in these genera exhibit a diversity of biologies. Three genera involve species that invade galls induced by other thrips: Androthrips monsterae (Moulton) from New Guinea is newly recorded from Australia; Mesothrips jordani Zimmermann from South\u2010East Asia is newly recorded from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:jL-93Qbq4QoC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15879325217689939382", "cites_id": ["15879325217689939382"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222930701783219", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tq1POSeyXtwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 7, "2013": 7, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 5, "2017": 2, "2018": 6, "2019": 2, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
