A new genus and species, Erythridothrips cubilis, is described from Australian tropical rain-forest. The South African genus Audiothrips is withdrawn from synonymy with Erythrothrips and a new species, A. senckenbergiana, is described. The sole African species in the American genus Stomatothrips is transferred to the African genus Allelothrips. The relationships of these taxa are discussed, together with reasons for questioning the validity of the tribe Orothripini."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://brill.com/view/journals/ise/24/3/article-p285_2.xml", "cites_per_year": {}}
