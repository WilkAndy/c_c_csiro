They suck and chew and mine the fruits and leaves and stems, from the youngest seedlings to the post-harvest remains. Some are specific to cotton and related plants, others simply find ideal breeding conditions in the vast cultivated plantings which are so important to man's economy in many of the warm dry parts of the world.
