Nom., vol. 31, pp. 228-229 and was based on the premise that Thrips rufa Haliday, 1836 is a junior primary homonym of Thrips rufa Gmelin, 1790. It was voted on affirmatively by the Commission in 1978, but no Opinion was issued because of the following comments by two members of the Commission. 2. Dr CW Sabrosky remarked:\" I do not quarrel with the basic purpose of the application, viz., to stabilize the name Thrips rufus in the family THRIPIDAE, but there are basic faults in the approach and I regret that I did not notice these earlier (1) There is no such name as \u201cThrips rufa Haliday\". Haliday clearly cited the reference to Thrips rufa Gmelin, no 11, and we are thus dealing with T. rufa Gmelin sensu Haliday, a misidentification. Technically, then, suppression of T. rufa Gmelin leaves rufa (or rufus) of authors nameless, unless there are available \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:xGWFX6Gbr9MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.archive.org/work/ouoyk7whffexxe6i47bkgp7cbe/access/wayback/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/partpdf/23529", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bmptsYxain4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
