Pseudophilothrips is here recognized as a weakly defined genus comprising 13 described species from the Americas. This genus is presumably derived from within, rather than sister-genus to, the worldwide genus Liothrips of leaf-feeding species."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 68, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=741310896285953995", "cites_id": ["741310896285953995"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2432.1.3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yy9AIVWqSQoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 8, "2014": 7, "2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 7, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
