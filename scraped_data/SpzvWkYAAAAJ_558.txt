That this is not a true faunal difference has become evident from collections made in the last few years in Nigeria, Kenya, and Sudan*. The family is clearly well represented throughout the continent, and this paper has been drawn up to indicate how inadequate is the available information on the occurrence of the species, to provide a means of recognizingthe genera, and a basis from which further studies may be made. The magnification is indicated in the figures by a line oi mm. in length. All the species recorded from West Africa and the Congo are referred to here, and if possible redescribed. The genera Corbettia and Aleuropteridis however are only treated briefly as they have recently been revised elsewhere. Thirteen new species and one new genus are described, with three new synonymsand three new combinations. Forty species are now recognizable from the area. Unless statedto the contrary, the material used in this study is deposited in the British Museum (Natural History), and this incudes the type material of the African species described by both Corbett and Dozier. Most of the recent material has been collected by Dr. V. F. Eastop (V. F. E.), or the author (L. A. M.) and his assistants, EA James (E. A. J.) and M. O. Ezeigwe (M. 0. E.). Dr. Eastop spent eighteen months on secondment from the British Museum to the West African Inter-Territorial Secretariat collecting aphids and whitefly, and the author was employed for eighteen months by the Federal Department of Agricultural Research, Nigeria.
