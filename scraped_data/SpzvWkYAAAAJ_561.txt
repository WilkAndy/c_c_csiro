The characters by which this gmup may be distinguished, and the level at which the group should be classified, family, sub\u2014family, tribe or genusgroup, are discussed. It is concluded that recognition of the group at supra-generic level is not useful because it renders the rest of Phlaeothripidae paraphyleric."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12087556049922210654&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Xrs8Ti-gv6cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
