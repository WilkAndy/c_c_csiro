The systematic position of this genus, and its relationships to the paleotropical Rhamphothrips genus-group, are discussed. A key is provided to the two new species, one of which was taken on Persea flowers in Colombia, the other from Hortia flowers in Brazil.Many species of the insect order Thysanoptera have a wide distribution around the world as pests (Lewis, 1997). These extensive distributions result partly from such species being transported along human trade routes in crops and other products (Mound, 1983), but also from the natural dispersal powers of the small adults with their slender fringed wings. Despite these disrupted distributions, it is possible to detect many natural geographical distribution patterns at genus, and even at familylevel. Thus the family Heterothripidae, comprising 7 1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rita-Marullo/publication/232664822_Nexothrips_A_new_genus_of_thripine_thysanoptera_insecta_from_the_neotropics_and_its_paleotropical_faunal_affinities/links/562c8fef08ae04c2aeb36bea/Nexothrips-A-new-genus-of-thripine-thysanoptera-insecta-from-the-neotropics-and-its-paleotropical-faunal-affinities.pdf", "cites_per_year": {}}
