Although commonly considered flower insects, due to a northern hemisphere literature bias, worldwide about 40% of thrips species feed only on fungus in leaf-litter or on dead twigs, and about 30% feed only on green leaf tissues. Many of the flower-feeding species, such as western flower thrips and onion thrips, are important horticultural pests. On Acacia flowers, a few thrips may be found occasionally, but in Australia there has been a massive radiation of highly specific \u201cleaf-feeding\u201d thrips in association with the phyllodes of many species, particularly those from sections Juliflorae and Plurinerves. In addition, an unrelated thrips species induces galls on one Indian Acacia and a second on an African Acacia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/animals/thrips.php", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q9SzqTEL0DkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
