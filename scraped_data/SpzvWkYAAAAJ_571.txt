The true country of origin of this thrips, however, does not necessarily lie within Europe, because another species taken recently during studies on the thrips fauna of Navarra-Nafarroa (Goldarazena, 1996) proved to be Tylothrips osborni (Hinds), a typical member of the North American fungus-feeding, leaf-litter thrips fauna (Mound, 1977). Since this is the first record of Tylothrips osborni from Europe, the possibility exists that the new species of Hindsiothrips described below is also from North America."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arturo-Goldarazena/publication/257951578_A_new_species_of_Hindsiothrips_from_Spain_with_the_first_record_of_Tylothrips_osborni_Hinds_from_Europe_Thysanoptera_Phlaeothripidae/links/00463526792aae68e8000000/A-new-species-of-Hindsiothrips-from-Spain-with-the-first-record-of-Tylothrips-osborni-Hinds-from-Europe-Thysanoptera-Phlaeothripidae.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5rTK2c6K1SgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
