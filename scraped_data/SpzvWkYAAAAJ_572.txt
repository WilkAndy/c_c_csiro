The sepals of each \ufb02ower are S-shaped and enclose a central cavity within which the lhrips live and breed. Although some large ants are unable to penetrate this cavity, other ants are small enough to enter the space between the petals and sepals, and this leads to a reduction in thrips numbers. Several other members of this genus of thrips are known from the \ufb02owers or other species of Malpighiaceae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2519297527494487605&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NS7U4cBX9iIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
