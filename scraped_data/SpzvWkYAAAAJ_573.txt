They are wingless, highly modified, flat-bodied insects that are external parasites of birds and mammals. Adults range in length from less than 0.5 to 11 mm, and have diversified into a great variety of morphological types. They are obligate parasites, ic they spend their complete life cycle on the host, cementing their eggs onto feathers or hairs, and are totally dependent on the heat, humidity and secretions produced by the host. Both adults and nymphs have a similar diet which, depending on the species, may be blood, feathers, skin debris, mucus or serum (Marshall 1981). As permanent parasites, their geographical distribution (with some notable exceptions, see Clay 1976; Barker & Close 1990), is often that of their hosts. Therefore, the identity of the host is an important piece of ecological information associated with a louse. A list of host-lice associations for the Australian fauna is given in Appendix IV.There is no recent comprehensive publication on Australian lice. The first lists of Australian lice, which include several introduced species, were compiled by 10hnston & Harrison (1912a, b, 1913). Thompson & Plomley (1938) listed 104 species from native Australian birds and mammals. Subsequently, Murray et al.(1990, 1993) listed the lice recorded from some groups of birds; they also included many species from non-Australian localities. At a regional level, the lice from Tasmania are better known than those from any other part of Australia (Green & Palma 1991). Descriptions of new species and references to Australian lice are scattered over a great range of publications \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ricardo-Palma-5/publication/283018467_Phthiraptera/links/5626d4d808aed3d3f138a5f3/Phthiraptera.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XhJFsXaHbiEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
