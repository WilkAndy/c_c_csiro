These thrips exhibit social behaviours, ranging from solitary and colonial species to a variety of more complex social organisations. Furthermore, the domiciliary habits of these species include domicile construction, gall induction, and opportunistic use of abandoned galls and domiciles. This suite of thrips also includes a variety of inquiline and kleptoparasitic taxa. To understand how these various traits have evolved and interact in this diverse group, we have reconstructed a phylogeny for 42 species of thrips associated with Acacia around Australia. We obtained DNA sequence data from two nuclear genes (Elongation Factor-1\u03b1 and wingless) and one mitochondrial gene (cytochrome oxidase I) and analysed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 64, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2959470399175210172", "cites_id": ["2959470399175210172"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790302002580", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vDQf6qUmEikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 1, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 6, "2007": 4, "2008": 5, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 7, "2012": 5, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
