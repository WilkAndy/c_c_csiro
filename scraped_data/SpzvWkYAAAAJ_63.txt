The Thrips group is a lineage of species that apparently evolved in the Old World. In contrast, the Frankliniella group appears to be much older, possibly Gondwanan in origin, with independent diversifications into the South American and the SE Asian/Australian regions. Two new synonyms and one new combination are recognised amongst the Australian members of the Frankliniella group: Parabaliothrips montanus (Girault)[= Pseudanaphothrips annettae Mound & Palmer]; Pseudanaphothrips aureolus (Girault)"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15295412211885635734", "cites_id": ["15295412211885635734"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tamito-Sakurai/publication/267328098_REGGIO_E/links/544ab5840cf2d6347f401ee3/REGGIO-E.pdf#page=379", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lnidPl44RNQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 5}}
