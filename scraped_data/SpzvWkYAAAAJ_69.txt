Coleoptera provide pollination, or are thought to provide pollination, in many species of Zamiaceae, but not in Cycadaceae which are probably wind-pollinated (Rattray 1913; Norstog et al. 1986, 1992; Norstog 1987; Tang 1987; Norstog & Fawcett 1989; Donaldson 1990; Ornduff 1990, 1991a; Pellmyr et al. 1991; Vovides 1991; Chadwick 1993; Connell & Ladd 1993; Vovides et al. 1993). Several species of weevil have also been found to oviposit and pupate within the seed or cone tissue of cycads and are probably host specific (Donaldson 1992). Four genera of cycads occur in Australia, Bowenia Hook. ex JD Hook., Lepidozamia Regel and Macrozamia Miq. in the Zamiaceae (with 2, 2 and> 25 species respectively) and Cycas (Cycadaceae)(ca 20 species)(Hill 1992).
