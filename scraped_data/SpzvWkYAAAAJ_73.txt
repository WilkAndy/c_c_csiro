Filter papers on which males had walked attracted both sexes, the attraction being strongest when the odour was collected during the mating period and subsequently offered during this period. Field observations indicate that males aggregate and that females approach such aggregations for mating. In Australia, in the vicinity of citrus orchards, this thrips is associated particularly with non\u2010Australian perfumed white flowers. However, recent collecting indicates that the species is widespread in south\u2010eastern coastal areas far distant from citrus cultivation, in the flowers of an Australian native plant, Myoporum insulare. Despite this host plant evidence, morphological evidence continues to suggest retention of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9970397419279455723", "cites_id": ["9970397419279455723"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2006.00508.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:65WfnaD3XYoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
