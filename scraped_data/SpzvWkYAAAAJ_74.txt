Morphological variation in this species from various Asian countries is recorded and compared to the type speci mens. As a result Isoneurothrips jenseni Karny, 1925 and Thrips (Isoneurothrips) taiwanus Takahashi, 1936 are placed as synonyms of Thrips parvispinus (Karny, 1922). In contrast, Thrips compressicornis (Sakimura), a species from the Marquesa Islands of the Pacific that has previously been associated with these taxa, represents a very different species. The quarantine significance of T. par vispinus is emphasised."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16750505233753504781", "cites_id": ["16750505233753504781"], "pub_url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/235a/8a377da3b9fb924b68766c26302aea4bf223.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DfwyGsO_degJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 5, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 15, "2023": 5}}
