Each of them has an elongate and characteristically lyre\u2010shaped metathoracic endofurca, to which are attached the powerful muscles used by these minute leaf\u2010feeding thrips when jumping. Out of a world fauna in this subfamily of 10 genera and 86 species, six genera and 11 species are here recorded from Australia with a further new genus and species from New Caledonia. Leucothrips nigripennis Reuter, a pest of cultivated ferns previously known only from the northern hemisphere including southern India, is newly recorded from Australia and Brazil, and the suggestion made that the species is Neotropical in origin; the male is described for the first time as having simple antennal sense cones in contrast to the forked sense cones of females. Three species of Pseudodendrothrips are recorded from Australia: P \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11527019475801447952", "cites_id": ["11527019475801447952"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-6055.1999.00112.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:EJ4n9iMz-J8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 2, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
