It has remarkably pale forewings, and lives in the flowers of a malpighiaceous shrub in Brazilian cerrado. The sepals of each flower are S-shaped and enclose a central cavity within which the thrips live and breed. Although some large ants are unable to penetrate this cavity, other ants are small enough to enter the space between the petals and sepals, and this leads to a reduction in thrips numbers. Several other members of this genus of thrips are known from the flowers of other species of Malpighiaceae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12515185724498630348", "cites_id": ["12515185724498630348"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222939700770731", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zNbHrhvfrq0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 8, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 8, "2011": 3, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 5, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
