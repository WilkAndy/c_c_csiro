It is usually only possible to identify a solitary adult, either male or female, as belonging to one or other of the two subfamilies, Aleyrodinae or Aleurodicinae. The genera and species are best defined on the structure of the fourth, ie last, larval instar, which develops, as do the previous two instars, as an immotile scale closely a. ttached to a leaf surface.Russell (1948) deduced from collections of Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), on various host species, that in this whitefly the fourth instar (commonly referred to as the pupa) could vary considerably in its structure, and that this variation was correlated with the structure of the host leaf, on hairy leaves the pupal case bearing large papillae and long setae, and on glabrous leaves, small papillae and short setae. This host-correlated variation had led to the erection of a number of synonymous \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 210, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3207893647305082437", "cites_id": ["3207893647305082437"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1963.tb00746.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RQbarEa6hCwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1987": 3, "1988": 1, "1989": 0, "1990": 0, "1991": 2, "1992": 3, "1993": 3, "1994": 7, "1995": 6, "1996": 1, "1997": 4, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 4, "2001": 7, "2002": 5, "2003": 5, "2004": 6, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 9, "2008": 3, "2009": 7, "2010": 11, "2011": 13, "2012": 12, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 10, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 16, "2020": 10, "2021": 5, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
