Morphological segregates in which winged individuals are known show little variation between populations, and these segregates can be regarded as distinct species. However, morphological segregates in which winged individuals are not known exist in the field as a complex of similar but distinctive local forms. Taxonomy is concerned with the interpretation in biological terms of morphological difference, but the significance of these distinctive populations cannot be determined at present, whether they are species, subspecies, or local variants. However, this high rate of incipient speciation of the Urothripini is evidently related, at least in part, to the low degree of dispersive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6856551134425121512", "cites_id": ["6856551134425121512"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/zo/ZO9720083", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6AK23-1cJ18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 1, "1987": 0, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 0, "1991": 0, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 3, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
