Thrips comprise the only order besides Hymenoptera where females are diploid and males are haploid. This makes them useful insects for studying the roles of kin selection and ecology in social evolution.2.\u2003Kladothrips hamiltoni is one of six species of Australian gall\u2010inducing thrips that have been identified as eusocial. Galls are initiated by a single foundress, who rears her brood and remains within the enclosed gall for life. The adults of both sexes of her first brood cohort are morphologically distinct from the second generation, comprising a nondispersing soldier caste. The foundress and sib\u2010mated soldiers jointly produce a second, dispersing generation, approximately 60\u201380% of which are produced by the soldiers. Mean per capita egg production of female soldiers is less than 33% that of the foundress.3.\u2003Adult eclosion of soldiers is protandrous but the overall sex ratio of the soldiers lacks bias (52 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:kh2fBNsKQNwC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12080319207694750577", "cites_id": ["12080319207694750577"], "pub_url": "https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00207.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cVP5q1DqpacJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 3, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 2, "2004": 2, "2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 1, "2008": 3, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 4, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
