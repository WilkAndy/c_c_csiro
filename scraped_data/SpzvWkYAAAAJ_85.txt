Sexual differences in adult thrips involve size and colour, antennal structure and sensoria, and structure of the abdomen. The previously unknown male of Aroidothrips longistylus Ananthakrishnan (Thripidae) from India is described with the longest antennal sensoria known in any thrips species, and a related sexually dimorphic Malaysian species is described, Filipinothrips ananthakrishnani sp. n. In the Aeolothripidae, the male of Franklinothrips vespiformis (Crawford) is described for the first time and newly recorded from India, and differences between the sexes of Indothrips bhushani Bhatti are described. The lack of information on the development and biological significance of sexual dimorphism in terebrantiate thrips is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 49, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2380532490784265691", "cites_id": ["2380532490784265691"], "pub_url": "https://brill.com/view/journals/ise/39/2/article-p155_3.xml", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:29V4EbBZCSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
