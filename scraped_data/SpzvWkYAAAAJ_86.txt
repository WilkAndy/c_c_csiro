Members of the sub-order Tubulifera are particularly diverse, with different species feeding on leaves, flowers, fungal hyphae, fungal spores, mosses, and also acting as predators of other small arthropods (Mound & Marullo 1996). This communication, however, concerns a member of the Terebrantia, the sub-order that includes the basal clades of the Thysanoptera.The plesiotypic life style of thrips is presumed to have involved fungus or detritus feeding (Mound, Heming & Palmer 1980), a habit retained in one basal clade, Merothripidae. Subsequent radiations presumably involved flower-feeding. Indeed, species of one genus of Aeolothripidae, another of the basal clades, have recently been demonstrated to breed \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC", "num_citations": 48, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17281889038398042795", "cites_id": ["17281889038398042795"], "pub_url": "https://bioone.org/journals/Florida-Entomologist/volume-85/issue-1/0015-4040(2002)085[0281:ADHTFE]2.0.CO;2/AULACOTHRIPS-DICTYOTUS-HETEROTHRIPIDAE-THE-FIRST-ECTOPARASITIC-THRIPS-THYSANOPTERA/10.1653/0015-4040(2002)085[0281:ADHTFE]2.0.CO;2.full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q7JuXYSa1e8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 4, "2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 3, "2011": 4, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 3}}
