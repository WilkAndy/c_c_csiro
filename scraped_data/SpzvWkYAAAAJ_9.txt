Only seven of these are known to be vectors of tospoviruses; records for a further three species as well as a particular color variety of a fourth require further substantiation. All ten species are members of the subfamily Thripinae, but they do not form a closely related group. It is suggested that the associations between thrips and tospoviruses have arisen independently several times. An identification key to the seven confirmed vector thrips is appended."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 207, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13102788551740441637", "cites_id": ["13102788551740441637"], "pub_url": "https://www.actahort.org/books/431/431_26.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JUSLKcR01rUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 11, "2000": 5, "2001": 7, "2002": 10, "2003": 9, "2004": 14, "2005": 12, "2006": 7, "2007": 12, "2008": 2, "2009": 5, "2010": 7, "2011": 5, "2012": 6, "2013": 9, "2014": 15, "2015": 12, "2016": 13, "2017": 12, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 7, "2022": 8, "2023": 1}}
