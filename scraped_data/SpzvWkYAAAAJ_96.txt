Pore plates are present in more than 60% of genera in this family, and known to be absent in about 20%; males are not known in a further 20% of the genera. In families of Terebrantia other than Thripidae, pore plates also occur in Fauriellidae, Heterothripidae and Adiheterothripidae, but not in Aeolothripidae, Melanthripidae and Uzelothripidae. Females in a very few species of Thripidae have pore plates apparently similar to those of males."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "SpzvWkYAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2934389060091801786", "cites_id": ["2934389060091801786"], "pub_url": "https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.2129.1.2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:unCQl00LuSgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 0, "2011": 3, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 5, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
