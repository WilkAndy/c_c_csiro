Both offset and variations are too large to be of atmospheric origin such as the inter-hemispheric gradient and can also not be explained by analytical uncertainties. Higher ice temperatures and impurity content favour post depositional processes such as reactions between the contained chemical species; this could explain enhanced variability and higher CO 2 concentrations in Greenlandic compared to Antarctic ice. Various chemical reaction mechanisms leading to such CO 2 in-situ production have been proposed (ie acidification of carbonates, oxidation of aldehydes and photodecarboxilation of humic like substances). We tested the above hypotheses combining analysis of CO 2, \u03b4 13 C-CO 2 and chemical \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16830173797678460261", "cites_id": ["16830173797678460261"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.C54B..03J/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZS22HubJkOkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 2}}
