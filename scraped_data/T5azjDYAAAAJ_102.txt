With human population increase and industrialization, pCH4 is now about 250% higher than it was in the early 1800s, and it has shown a significantly larger percentages increase than that of carbon dioxide, the gas which is most often the focus of greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation strategies. Surprisingly, in the past decade, pCH4 has stabilized at a global average of \u223c1750 ppb. Human impacts on methane are also important. The methane emissions from rice cultivation, cattle farming, and biomass burning clearly impact the atmospheric methane budget today and may have been important long before the industrial era. The baseline against which early human impacts on methane so far, have been measured is pCH4 levels in the past obtained from air trapped in ice cores.
