They have very high air age resolution, data density and measurement precision. Firn air measurements span the past 65 years and overlap with the ice core and direct atmospheric observations. Major increases in CO sub(2), CH sub(4) and N sub(2)O concentrations during the past 200 years followed a period of relative stability beforehand. Decadal variations during the industrial period include the stabilization of CO sub(2) and slowing of CH sub(4) and N sub(2)O growth in the 1940s and 1950s. Variations of up to 10 ppm CO sub(2), 40 ppb CH sub(4) and 10 ppb N sub(2)O occurred throughout the preindustrial period. Methane concentrations grew by 100 ppb from AD 0 to 1800 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6444564629793727568", "cites_id": ["6444564629793727568"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6444564629793727568&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UOTm0mKxb1kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
