In addition, a complementary laboratory study of its most likely atmospheric loss processes, its infrared absorption spectrum, and global warming potential (GWP) are reported. First atmospheric measurements of c-C4F8O are provided from the Cape Grim Air Archive (41\u2218\u2009S, Tasmania, Australia, 1978\u2013present), supplemented by two firn air samples from Antarctica, in situ measurements of ambient air at Aspendale, Victoria (38\u2218\u2009S), and a few archived air samples from the Northern Hemisphere. The atmospheric abundance in the Southern Hemisphere has monotonically grown over the past decades and leveled at 74\u2009ppq (parts per quadrillion, femtomole per mole in dry air) by 2015\u20132018. The growth rate of c-C4F8O has decreased from a maximum in 2004 of 4.0 to <0.25\u2009ppq\u2009yr\u22121 in 2017 and 2018. Using a 12-box atmospheric transport model, globally averaged yearly emissions and abundances of c-C4F8O are calculated for 1951\u20132018. Emissions, which we speculate to derive predominantly from usage of c-C4F8O as a solvent in the semiconductor industry, peaked at 0.15 (\u00b10.04, 2\u03c3)\u2009kt\u2009yr\u22121 in 2004 and have since declined to <0.015\u2009kt\u2009yr\u22121 in 2017 and 2018. Cumulative emissions over the full range of our record amount to 2.8 (2.4\u20133.3)\u2009kt, which correspond to 34 Mt of CO2-equivalent emissions. Infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectra for c-C4F8O as well as the reactive channel rate coefficient for the O(1D)\u2009+\u2009c-C4F8O reaction were determined from laboratory studies.
