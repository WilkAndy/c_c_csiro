Variations in the global abundance of 14CO that are not explained by variations in 14C production are mainly driven by variations in the global abundance of OH. Monitoring OH variability via methyl chloroform is becoming increasingly difficult as methyl chloroform abundance is continuing to decline. Measurements of atmospheric 14CO have previously been successfully used to infer OH variability. However, these measurements have only continued at one location (Baring Head, New Zealand), which is insufficient to infer global trends. We propose to restart global 14CO monitoring with the aim of providing an additional constraint on OH variability. A new analytical system for 14CO sampling and measurements has \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16774545421959982361", "cites_id": ["16774545421959982361"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140491199&h=FF6YnrpLgRdN1s%2B46wAArkyKzUMF92h1KQh1I6%2F%2Fqz30ythHcTXSzO%2B%2BZrB8ykaI2NqfdEzFK3Elfkvpaffotw%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GW2UmC8oy-gJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2}}
