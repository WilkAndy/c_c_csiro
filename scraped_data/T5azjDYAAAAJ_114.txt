Since atmospheric CO2 has a large and varying background concentration, atmospheric monitoring of only CO2 at geologic CO2 storage sites will be a weak monitoring strategy, with poor detection limits for any leakage of CO2 that may occur. The sensitivity of leak detection will be greatly improved by including continuous atmospheric measurements of tracers in the stored fluid body, such as CH4 and isotopes of CO2. Two analyzers, based on Wavelength-Scanned Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (WS-CRDS), one for simultaneous CH4 and CO2 measurements and one for 13C isotope measurements of CO2, were recently deployed by CSIRO at the CO2CRC Otway geological storage pilot project in Victoria, Australia (see link below).
