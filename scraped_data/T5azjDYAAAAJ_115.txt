Over this 65 year period, the isotopic compositions show overall decreasing trends, consistent with previous firn air measurements and with the prediction that the increase in atmospheric N2O is a result of agricultural and other human activities that produce N2O that is isotopically lighter than the natural sources. For the Cape Grim archived air, the trends in \u03b415Nbulk, \u03b415N\u03b1, \u03b415N\u03b2, and \u03b418O are-0.036\u00b10.003,-0.028\u00b10.022,-0.038\u00b10.022, and-0.023\u00b10.006\u2030 yr-1, respectively, while those for the Law Dome firn air are-0.033\u00b10.004,-0.031\u00b10.014,-0.034\u00b10.017, and-0.023\u00b10.003\u2030 yr-1, respectively \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1406233132011751009", "cites_id": ["1406233132011751009"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.A21A0125P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YQbyQJXxgxMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
