The measurements on archived air show significant decreasing trends in the nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions over the last 30 years and are the first direct observations of a historical change in N2O isotopic composition in the late 20th century. These decreasing trends of-0.042\u00b10.004\u2030 yr-1 for \u03b415N,-0.04\u00b10.03\u2030 yr-1 for site-specific \u03b415N\u03b1, and-0.031\u00b10.006\u2030 yr-1 for \u03b418O support the prediction that the increase in the atmospheric N2O burden is a result of agricultural activities which produce isotopically light N2O. The observed trends are larger than box model predictions [Rahn and Wahlen, 2000] and are similar to those derived from other firn air measurements [Roeckmann et \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4610080431727084252", "cites_id": ["4610080431727084252"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFM.A44B..03P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3IISN7pL-j8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
