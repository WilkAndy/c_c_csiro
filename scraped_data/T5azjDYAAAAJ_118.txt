Stable isotopes allow the diagnosis of atmospheric circulation (Lawrence et al., 1982), moisture source regions and atmospheric transport (Rindsberger et al., 1990). Investigation of precipitation records over south eastern Australia is being approached in two ways. Firstly, with the establishment of the Melbourne University Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (MUNIP). This is a series of collection sites across the Melbourne metropolitan region with the aim of sampling rain half hourly during particular rain events to document isotopic variability over small scales in time and space. The first full observational experiment occurred on June 9, 2004. Initial analysis of the atmospheric circulation around the hemisphere for this rain event has been performed using \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16643905563432733988", "cites_id": ["16643905563432733988"], "pub_url": "https://wgne.net/bluebook/uploads/2005/individual-articles/01_Barras_Vaughan_moisture_transport.pdf.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JE2OP-0H--YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 1}}
