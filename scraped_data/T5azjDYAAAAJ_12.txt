The Law Dome site satisfies many of the desirable characteristics of an ideal ice core site for atmospheric CO 2 reconstructions including negligible melting of the ice sheet surface, low concentrations of impurities, regular stratigraphic layering undisturbed at the surface by wind or at depth by ice flow, and high snow accumulation rate. Further details on the site, drilling, and cores are provided in Etheridge et al.(1996), Etheridge and Wookey (1989), and Morgan et al (1997)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 275, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18003616937114393142", "cites_id": ["18003616937114393142"], "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/lawdome", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NtrokDey2fkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 2, "2000": 5, "2001": 1, "2002": 3, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 7, "2006": 12, "2007": 12, "2008": 14, "2009": 17, "2010": 16, "2011": 20, "2012": 11, "2013": 22, "2014": 12, "2015": 15, "2016": 12, "2017": 13, "2018": 11, "2019": 8, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 12, "2023": 4}}
