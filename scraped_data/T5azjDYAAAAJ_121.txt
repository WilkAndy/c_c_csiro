The trapped air is influenced not only by past atmospheric composition but also by processes that occur in the firn (the porous layer of compacted snow in the upper part of an ice sheet). An understanding of these processes is necessary to accurately interpret ice core measurements. Diffusive mixing is important throughout the firn, but convective mixing (eg caused by pressure gradients due to surface wind or buoyancy due to seasonal temperature gradients) can dominate near the surface at some sites. Covariation of convective mixing in the upper firn and seasonality of the atmospheric abundance of some tracers has the potential to shift the mean level of a tracer in the firn and ice relative to the mean of the atmospheric record, a so-calledrectifier effect'."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14037810571894333090", "cites_id": ["14037810571894333090"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMC033...02T/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oh788VZS0MIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
