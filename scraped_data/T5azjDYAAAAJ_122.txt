We measured methane concentrations over 1.5 years from two monitoring stations established 80 km apart on either side of the main CSG belt located within a study area of 350\u00d7 350 km2. Coupling bottom-up inventory and inverse modelling approaches, we quantify methane emissions from this area. The inventory suggests that the total emission is 173\u00d7 106 kg CH4 yr-1, with grazing cattle contributing about half of that, cattle feedlots\u223c 25%, and CSG Processing\u223c 8%. Using the inventory emissions in a forward regional transport model indicates 15 that the above sources are significant contributors to methane at both monitors. However, the model underestimates approximately the highest 15% of the observed methane concentrations, suggesting underestimated or missing emissions. An efficient regional Bayesian inverse model is developed, incorporating an hourly source-receptor relationship based on a backward-in-time configuration of the forward regional transport model, a posterior sampling scheme, and the hourly methane observations. The inferred emissions obtained from one of the inverse model setups that uses a Gaussian prior 20 whose averages are identical the gridded bottom-up inventory emissions across the domain with an uncertainty of 3% of the averages best describes the observed methane. Having only two stations is not adequate at sampling distant source areas of the study domain, and this necessitates a small prior uncertainty.
