Changes in [OH] in response to large changes in reactive trace gas emissions (which may occur in the future) are uncertain. Measurements of 14C-containing carbon monoxide (14CO) and other tracers such as methyl chloroform over the last\u2248 25 years have been successfully used to monitor changes in average OH concentration ([OH]), but there are no observational constraints on [OH] further back in time. Reconstructions of 14CO from ice cores could in principle provide such constraints but are complicated by in-situ production of 14CO by cosmic rays directly in the ice. Recent work in Antarctica and Greenland shows that this in-situ component would be relatively small and can be accurately corrected for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15740504761543522155", "cites_id": ["15740504761543522155"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AGUFM.A13B2066N/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:a3clEa-BcdoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1}}
