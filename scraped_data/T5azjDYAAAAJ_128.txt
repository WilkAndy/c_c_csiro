Measured 14CH4 values (28-35 pMC) were higher than predicted under any scenario based on sample age. Sample 14CH4 appears to be elevated by in-situ CH4 production in the ice for some samples as well as by a second process that is likely direct cosmogenic production of 14CH4 molecules in the ice. 14C of CO and CO2 was measured to better understand these processes and corrections \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17471670120769394284", "cites_id": ["17471670120769394284"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.U34A..05P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bBZE7WfXd_IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
