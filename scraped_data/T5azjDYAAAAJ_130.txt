The start of this rapid methane increase was synchronous with an even more rapid climate warming--ice core nitrogen and argon isotope records indicate that temperatures in central Greenland rose about 10 C over just a few decades. Current hypotheses attribute this methane rise to increased bacterial methane production in wetlands, and/or to the dissociation of large quantities of methane hydrates. Here we describe the progress of a project whose aim is to quantify the role of methane hydrates in this observed methane rise by measuring the 14 C of methane derived from air bubbles in glacial ice. Methane hydrates are too old to contain measurable 14 C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8526262099942119101", "cites_id": ["8526262099942119101"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.A52A0766P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vRbtsDReU3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1}}
