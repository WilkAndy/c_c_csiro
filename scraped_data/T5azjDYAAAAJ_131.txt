The plot shows small variations in atmospheric methane during the natural climatic events: the medieval warm period (1000\u20131300 AD) and Little Ice Age (1550\u20131800 AD). These contrast with the dramatic increase in methane over the last 200 years. The blue symbols are measurements from ice; the red line at the end of the record is from recent atmospheric measurements from Cape Grim, Tasmania.(Adapted from"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13935686288045772452", "cites_id": ["13935686288045772452"], "pub_url": "https://niwa.co.nz/sites/default/files/import/attachments/ice.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pA5ANNiAZcEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1}}
