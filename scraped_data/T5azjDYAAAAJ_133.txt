Evaluating climate-chemical models under different conditions than today and constraining past CO sources requires a reliable record of atmospheric CO mixing ratios ([CO]) since pre-industrial times. Here, we report the first continuous record of atmospheric [CO] for Southern Hemisphere (SH) high latitudes over the past three millennia. Our continuous record is a composite of three high-resolution Antarctic ice core gas records and firn air measurements from seven Antarctic locations. The ice core gas [CO] records were measured by continuous flow analysis (CFA) using an optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectrometer (OF-CEAS), achieving excellent external precision (2.8\u20138.8 ppbv, 2\u03c3), and consistently low blanks (ranging from 4.1 \u00b1 1.2 to 7.4 \u00b1 1.4 ppbv), enabling paleo-atmospheric interpretations. Six new firn air [CO] Antarctic datasets collected between 1993 and 2016 CE at the DE08-2, DSSW19K, DSSW20K, South Pole, ABN, and Lock-In sites (and one previously published firn CO dataset at Berkner) were used to reconstruct the atmospheric history of CO from ~1897 CE using inverse modeling that incorporates the influence of gas transport in firn. Excellent consistency was observed between the youngest ice core gas [CO] and the [CO] from the base of the firn, and between the recent firn [CO] and atmospheric [CO] measurements at Mawson station (East Antarctica), yielding a consistent and contiguous record of CO across these different \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:PVgj2kMGcgYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cp.copernicus.org/preprints/cp-2023-9/", "cites_per_year": {}}
