Surface pressure changes weakly disrupt gravitational isotopic settling in the firn layer, which is recorded in krypton-86 excess (). The  may therefore reflect the time-averaged synoptic pressure variability over several years (site \u201cstorminess\u201d), but it likely cannot record individual synoptic events as ice core gas samples typically average over several years. We validate  using late Holocene ice samples from 11 Antarctic ice cores and 1 Greenland ice core that collectively represent a wide range of surface pressure variability in the modern climate. We find a strong spatial correlation (, ) between site average  and time-averaged synoptic variability from reanalysis data. The main uncertainties in the analysis are the corrections for gas loss and thermal fractionation and the relatively large scatter in the data. Limited scientific understanding of the firn physics and potential biases of  require caution in interpreting this proxy at present. We show that Antarctic  appears to be linked to the position of the Southern Hemisphere eddy-driven subpolar jet (SPJ), with a southern position enhancing pressure variability.We present a  record covering the last 24\u202fkyr from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core. Based on the empirical spatial correlation of synoptic activity and  at various Antarctic sites, we interpret this record to show that West Antarctic synoptic activity is slightly below modern levels during the Last Glacial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/19/579/2023/cp-19-579-2023.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
