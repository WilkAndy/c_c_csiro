Methane is a long-lived greenhouse gas and the second most significant contributor to radiative forcing from greenhouse gases after carbon dioxide. Improved understanding of methane emissions from different sectors in Australia is necessary to focus and prioritise mitigation efforts and to track progress towards emissions reduction; however, methane emissions are uncertain, especially at fine resolution (urban and regional scales) needed for mitigation. Moreover, improving predictions of atmospheric methane mole fractions requires precise and accurate emission estimates; However, previous studies indicate a mismatch between current emission estimates and atmospheric observations.Here, we use a combination of surface atmospheric measurements of methane and an inversion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-4716.html", "cites_per_year": {}}
