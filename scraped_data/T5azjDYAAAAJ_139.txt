Its global concentration has risen by 240 % since 1750 AD. Atmospheric \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 is an independent and potentially unambiguous tracer of fossil CH\u2084 emissions from anthropogenic and natural geologic sources, however, \u00b9\u2074C from nuclear weapons tests and \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 from nuclear power plants complicate its interpretation after the late 1950s. Measurements before then rely on air extracted from polar ice and firn. Hmiel et al. (Nature, 2020) measured \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 in air extracted from firn and ice in Greenland and Antarctica and found that the natural global fossil CH\u2084 source is very small (<6 Tg CH\u2084 /yr). This is inconsistent with bottom-up geological CH\u2084 emissions estimates (40-60 Tg CH\u2084 /yr) and implies an upward revision of anthropogenic fossil source emissions, emphasising the need for further measurements. We present new \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 measurements of air extracted from the high accumulation site DE08-OH on the Law Dome ice sheet in 2018/19, including firn air to 81 m depth and large ice samples combined from parallel ice cores to 240 m. Measurements of trace gases confirm that the samples were uncontaminated and only minor corrections are required for sample processing. The correction for cosmogenic in-situ production of \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 is very small at DE08-OH due to its high accumulation rate and relatively low elevation. The new \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 results compare closely with the previous measurements from the other sites. An atmospheric \u00b9\u2074CH\u2084 history is reconstructed from inverse modelling of the combined ice and firn data.
