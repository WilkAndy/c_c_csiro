Fossil fuel extraction and use are among the largest anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions, but the precise magnitude of these contributions is a subject of debate,. Carbon-14 in CH4 (14CH4) can be used to distinguish between fossil (14C-free) CH4 emissions and contemporaneous biogenic sources; however, poorly constrained direct 14CH4 emissions from nuclear reactors have complicated this approach since the middle of the 20th century,. Moreover, the partitioning of total fossil CH4 emissions (presently 172 to 195 teragrams CH4 per year), between anthropogenic and natural geological sources (such as seeps and mud volcanoes) is under debate; emission inventories suggest that the latter account for about 40 to 60 teragrams CH4 per year,. Geological emissions were less \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 218, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7876218532329592642", "cites_id": ["7876218532329592642"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1991-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QpfacAbzTW0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 41, "2021": 67, "2022": 68, "2023": 38}}
