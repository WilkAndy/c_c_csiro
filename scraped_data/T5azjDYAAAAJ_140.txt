Changes in OH concentration ([OH]) in response to large changes in reactive trace gas emissions (which may occur in the future) are uncertain. Measurements of 14C containing carbon monoxide (14CO) and other tracers such as methyl chloroform over the last \u224825 years have been successfully used to monitor changes in average [OH], but there are no observational constraints on [OH] further back in time. Reconstructions of 14CO from ice cores could in principle provide such constraints but are complicated by in-situ production of 14CO by cosmic rays directly in the ice. Recent work in Antarctica and Greenland shows that this in-situ component would be relatively small and can be accurately corrected for at sites with very high snow accumulation rates. A joint US and Australian team sampled and measured firn air and ice at Law Dome, Antarctica (2018-19 season, site DE08-OH, 1.2 m a-1 ice-equivalent snow accumulation), to a maximum depth of 240 m. Trapped air was extracted from the ice using an onsite large-volume ice melting system. Preliminary comparisons of methane measured in the samples to existing ice core records and atmospheric measurements suggest ice core air sample ages spanning from the 1870s to the early 2000s. Firn-air samples from the snow surface to 81 m depth capture air from the early 2000s to present. Analyses of [CO] and halocarbons in the samples show a relatively low and stable procedural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://apo.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/13218", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-ZBFmLtYoS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
