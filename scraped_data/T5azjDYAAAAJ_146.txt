The global pause in rising atmospheric CO2 during the period of mid- to high-latitude southern surface cooling known as the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14,700-12,700 years ago) provides an opportunity to disentangle competing influences. We present highly-resolved and precisely-aligned ice and marine reconstructions that capture a previously unrecognized increase in microbial diversity and ocean primary productivity during the ACR. Transient climate modeling across the last glacial suggests this period corresponds to a maximum seasonal difference in sea-ice extent. Our results indicate that this increased seasonal sea-ice variability drove changes in high-latitude light, temperature and nutrient availability, turning the southern seasonal sea-ice zone into a globally significant carbon sink."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/872/download/1947/", "cites_per_year": {}}
