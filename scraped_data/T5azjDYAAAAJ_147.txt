Following the Last Glacial Termination (LGT), the rapid rise in atmospheric CO2 was interrupted by an enigmatic 1,900-year plateau during a period of pronounced mid-to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling called the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14,600-12,700 years ago or 14.6-12.7 kyr BP. Figure 1). Here we report the first biomarker and ancient DNA analysis of a highly-resolved Antarctic'horizontal'ice core, which combined with marine sediment records reveals a coherent signal of marine productivity and microbial diversity changes across the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during the LGT. Our study develops four important new approaches in the analysis of biomarkers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140480346&h=bIg9p4jNClYjg8wgRcn8bY3DiV58bx%2BhvhtTmiYx9c4gL8XTHSb%2F3tM5qxhBzGqZCy7rUHpZYr1Ml%2B6MbHtcOQ%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
