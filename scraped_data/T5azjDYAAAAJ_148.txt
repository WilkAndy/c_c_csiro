Radiomethane (14CH4) can distinguish between fossil emissions from geologic reservoirs (radiocarbon free) and contemporaneous biogenic sources, although poorly constrained direct 14CH4 emissions from nuclear reactors complicate this interpretation in the modern era (Lassey et al., 2007; Zazzeri et al 2018). It has been debated how fossil emissions (172-195 Tg CH4/yr,(Saunois et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016)) are partitioned between anthropogenic sources (such as fossil fuel extraction and consumption) and natural sources (such as geologic seeps); emission inventories suggest \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140494283&h=lzT17N%2FwelMyaRCIY%2BqWgpQCkZWCysBQNv%2FpSsu%2BwUme%2FFUcwREXVltzjLeh2MGtEDdIL%2Bba3i8pmZLGeTHH2A%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
