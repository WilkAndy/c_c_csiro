The Surat Basin is a significant region of coal seam gas (CSG), agricultural and coal mining activities. The main aim of the study was to quantify CH4 emissions across the region using long-term in-situ observations of atmospheric CH4 concentrations from two stations which were 80 km apart and established on either side of existing and future-projected CSG activity. A gridded\" bottom-up\" methane emission inventory for the region was compiled for a domain of 350 km x 350 km. When used in a regional transport model (TAPM), it yielded a lower frequency and magnitude of concentration peaks than measured. Possible reasons include weaker/missing sources in the inventory, particularly near the monitors, and errors \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:NXb4pA-qfm4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140487635&h=UoZeHJfdI%2B%2Fq032nclJ%2Bv43Z7VTRNLLLH87pZu7NL1yrFRJz%2FOip6jRRjwsnvbk51KHVO58KVuK%2BujfqT1kIQw%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
