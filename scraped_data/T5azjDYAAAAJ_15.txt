Our analysis is motivated by the need to better understand the role and feedback of the carbon (C) cycle in climate change, by advances in measurement methods, and by apparent anomalies when comparing ice core and firn air \u03b413C records from Law Dome and South Pole. We demonstrate improved consistency between Law Dome ice, South Pole firn, and the Cape Grim (Tasmania) atmospheric \u03b413C data, providing evidence that our new record reliably extends direct atmospheric measurements back in time. We also show a revised version of early \u03b413C measurements covering the last 1000\u2009years, with a mean preindustrial level of \u22126.50\u2030. Finally, we use a Kalman Filter Double \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=561826832785762357", "cites_id": ["561826832785762357"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgrd.50668", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NWh6GYcCzAcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 7, "2015": 16, "2016": 23, "2017": 30, "2018": 27, "2019": 20, "2020": 27, "2021": 23, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
