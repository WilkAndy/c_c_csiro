Few measurements of atmospheric 14 CH 4 exist before the late 20 th century. We present measurements of past atmospheric 14 CH 4 in firn air and ice at Summit, Greenland. These data provide a record of atmospheric 14 CH 4 from 2013 back to 1750 CE. Results have been corrected for a small amount of cosmogenic in-situ production of 14 CH 4 within the ice crystal lattice. A firn gas transport model was used to simulate the transport of gases through the porous firn column and into fully closed ice, and an inverse model reconstructed the firn air and ice 14 CH 4 data into an atmospheric history.
