Following the last glacial, the rapid and punctuated rise in atmospheric CO2 was interrupted by an enigmatic 1,900-year plateau during a period of pronounced mid-to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling called the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14,600-12,700 years ago or 14.6-12.7 kyr BP). Here we report the first biomarker and DNA analysis of a highly-resolved Antarctic ice core, which combined with marine sediment records reveals a coherent signal of high-latitude Southern Ocean marine productivity and microbial diversity across the ACR. Transient climate modelling finds this period coincided with maximum seasonal variability in sea-ice extent, suggesting sea-ice feedbacks enhanced CO2 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..20.3467F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
