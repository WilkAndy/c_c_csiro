Unfortunately, the WSE suffers from a relative dearth of records, limiting our understanding of multi-decadal to centennial changes in the region. Here we explore the potential of biomarkers for understanding ocean-climate dynamics over the past century using a snow/ice core from Patriot Hills, located in the Ellsworth Mountains in the southern part of the WSE (Turney et al., 2013; Winter et al., 2016; Fogwill et al., 2017). The analysis consisted of a novel approach to reconstructing past variability, using a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and liquid chromatography to resolve organic signals contained within the ice.
