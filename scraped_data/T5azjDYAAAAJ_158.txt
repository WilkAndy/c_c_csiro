These measurements are used in combination with the AGAGE 2-D atmospheric 12-box model and a Bayesian inversion methodology to determine model atmospheric mole fractions and the history of global HFC-23 emissions. The global modelled annual mole fraction of HFC-23 in the background atmosphere was 28.9 \u00b1 0.6 pmolmol\u207b\u00b9 at the end of 2016, representing a 28% increase from 22.6 \u00b1 0.4 pmolmol\u207b\u00b9 in 2009. Over the same time frame, the modelled mole fraction of HCFC-22 increased by 19% from 199 \u00b1 2 to 237 \u00b1 2 pmolmol\u207b\u00b9. However, unlike HFC-23, the annual average HCFC-22 growth rate slowed from 2009 to 2016 at an annual average rate of -0.5 pmolmol\u207b\u00b9yr\u207b\u00b2. This slowing atmospheric growth is consistent with HCFC-22 moving from dispersive (high fractional emissions) to feedstock (low fractional emissions) uses, with HFC-23 emissions remaining as a consequence of incomplete mitigation from all HCFC-22 production. Our results demonstrate that, following a minimum in HFC-23 global emissions in 2009 of 9.6\u00b10.6, emissions increased to a maximum in 2014 of 14.5\u00b10 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:kz9GbA2Ns4gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/117597", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HdcvOaTi9dMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
