The model uses prescribed profiles of density, open and closed porosity, and diffusivity to determine the diffusion and trapping processes. The model is calibrated and tested by using measured air composition in the firn at the DE08\u20102 site on Law Dome, Antarctica. In particular, we focus on carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which have well\u2010determined atmospheric records (CO2 since 1958, CH4 since 1983, and SF6 since 1978). These trace gases are used to tune the diffusivity\u2010porosity relationship, which is the most uncertain of the model inputs. Modeled trace gas profiles in the DE08\u20102 firn are improved if allowance is made for reduced diffusion through the most prominent DE08\u20102 melt layer from the summer of 1989/1990. The relatively rapid growth rate of SF6 in the atmosphere permits good \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 175, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2792327009768883338", "cites_id": ["2792327009768883338"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/96JD03382", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:isQA-p5WwCYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 6, "2000": 10, "2001": 3, "2002": 11, "2003": 8, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 8, "2007": 7, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 7, "2012": 13, "2013": 15, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 6, "2017": 11, "2018": 9, "2019": 10, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
