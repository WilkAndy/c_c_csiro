An ensemble approach was used, allowing for the computation of both a median age and associated uncertainty as a function of depth. The revised chronology incorporates extended continuous annual layer counting to 853\u2009m using chemical species with seasonally-varying behaviours. The annual layer counted age at 853\u2009m is 2332 years before 2000 (y b2k) with an error of +13/\u22127\u2009y, i.e. 2345\u20132325\u2009y b2k . Below this depth, non-linear interpolation between age ties using a probability density function for age/depth is used to constrain and model the age of the ice. The ice-based age ties below the annual layer counted section are based on matching volcanic event markers, methane (CH4) gas concentration, isotopic composition of ice (\u03b418O) and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) dust peak to other records. For consistency, the timescale used for all matching is the AICC2012 timescale (Veres et al., 2013). The first ice-based age tie is the base of the annual layer counting record (2332\u2009y b2k) and the age ties from ~\u20092400\u20134000\u2009y b2k are volcanic synchronised ice-based age ties. The detection of abrupt changes in CH4 gas concentrations within the DSS record provides further independent gas-based age ties, including the tightly constrained 8200\u2009y b2k event. The improved age control between 9000 and 21000\u2009y b2k is supplemented by CH4 and \u03b418O ice measurements (Pedro et al., 2011). Over the period 16600 to 18600\u2009y b2k large changes in dust concentration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cp.copernicus.org/preprints/cp-2017-96/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GrIsVt7kVRQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
