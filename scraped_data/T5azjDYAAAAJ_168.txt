To quantify the growth rate and its causes, we performed a multi-site reconstruction of the atmospheric N2O mole fraction and isotopic composition using firn air data collected from Greenland and Antarctica in combination with a firn diffusion and densification model. The multi-site reconstruction showed that while the global mean N2O mole fraction increased from (290\u00b11) nmol mol-1 in 1940 to (322\u00b11) nmol mol-1 in 2008 the isotopic \u03b4 values of atmospheric N2O decreased by (-2.2\u00b10.2)\u2030 for \u03b415Nav,(-1.0\u00b10.3)\u2030 for \u03b418O,(-1.3\u00b10.6)\u2030 for \u03b415N\u03b1, and (-2.8\u00b10.6)\u2030 for \u03b415N\u03b2over the same period. The detailed temporal evolution of the mole fraction and isotopic composition derived from the firn air model was then used in a two-box atmospheric model (comprising a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..1910529P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
