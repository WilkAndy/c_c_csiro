The results presented here are from sixteen different sites (fourteen in Antartica, one in Greenland and one in the Yukon Territories, Canada), and they allow a better understanding of the parameters which influence the air content in ice. It is demonstrated the V can be expressed very simply as a function of the atmospheric pressure (Pi), the temperature (Ti) and the porous volume of ice (Vi) at which the air in the firn becomes isolated in terms of pressure from the atmosphere during the process of pore close-off. Our results confirm a Vi increase with temperature and show no clear Vi dependence on snow accumulation rate. The possible non-linearity of the Vi \u2212 Ti relation we obtain could be due to a wind \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 161, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17789265446377251869", "cites_id": ["17789265446377251869"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X9290002D", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HWRyAqwq4PYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 7, "1996": 3, "1997": 5, "1998": 2, "1999": 4, "2000": 5, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 7, "2009": 4, "2010": 3, "2011": 6, "2012": 3, "2013": 4, "2014": 6, "2015": 9, "2016": 13, "2017": 9, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
