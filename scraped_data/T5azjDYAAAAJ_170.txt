Additionally, 14C produced during nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 60s has enriched 14C/C ratios in decadally overturning reservoirs. Comparisons of simulated 14C and 13C dynamics between models and with observations can provide insights to key processes in the global carbon cycle including air-sea gas exchange, ocean mixing, terrestrial drought response, and vegetation and soil carbon turnover rates. However, the inclusion of carbon isotopes in large-scale model intercomparisons has so far been limited. One study, the Ocean Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project 2 (OCMIP2), used simulations of ocean 14C to identify biases in model ocean circulation that affect simulated anthropogenic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:2KloaMYe4IUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.B54C..03G/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
