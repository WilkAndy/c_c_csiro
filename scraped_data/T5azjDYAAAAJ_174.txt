Frequency analysis of the water isotope signal shows 1-year spectral power persists until about~ 15 ka bp, while signals at 4 years and greater are preserved throughout the entire record. At this level of resolution, a diffusion correction must be applied because high-frequency water isotope signals are attenuated mainly in the firn (but also in deep ice). We quantify diffusion over a 500-year sliding window to obtain an estimate of original power spectra at the time of deposition, and then determine the amplitude of high-frequency signals to~ 30 ka bp (the extent of the annually dated chronology). We observe that the amplitude of the annual signal varies with maximum insolation at 60 S, while the 2-15 year signal is elevated in the glacial, decreases at~ 16 ka bp until~ 10-11 ka bp, and maintains a constant minimum throughout the rest of the Holocene. While the annual (1-year) signal primarily represents seasonal temperature variations, the interannual variations reflect regional atmospheric circulation variability associated with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and intrinsic atmospheric dynamics. It should be noted that the strength of the 2-15 year signal is not strongly dependent on the diffusion calculations-indeed, the amount of diffusion to be corrected for only amplifies differences in the magnitude of interannual variability between Glacial and Holocene.
