However, the debate regarding the relative timing, geographical source and the physical mechanisms driving these rapid increases in sea level has catalyzed debate critical to predicting future sea level rise and climate. Here we present a unique record of West Antarctic Ice Sheet elevation change derived from the Patriot Hills blue ice area, located close to the modern day grounding line of the Institute Ice Stream in the Weddell Sea Embayment. Combined isotopic signatures and gas volume analysis from the ice allows us to develop a record of local ice sheet palaeo-altitude that is assessed against independent regional high-resolution ice sheet modeling studies, allowing us to demonstrate that past ice sheet elevations \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMPP54A..04F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
