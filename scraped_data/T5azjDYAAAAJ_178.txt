Quantified estimates of LIG temperatures suggest global mean temperatures were approximately 2 C warmer than the pre-industrial period, similar to the RCP2. 6 scenario for the end of the twenty-first century. Importantly this period is associated with a global sea level between 6.6 and 9.4 m higher than present day, of which a significant component most probably derived from Antarctica. However, the contribution from the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) remains highly uncertain. To investigate the stability of the WAIS we report new results from the Patriot Hills blue ice area, located close to the modern day grounding line of the Institute Ice Stream in the Weddell Sea Embayment. A multi proxy study of the ice (including water stable isotopes and atmospheric gas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFMPP43C2298T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
