However, questions regarding the relative timing, geographical source and the physical mechanisms driving these rapid increases in sea level have catalysed significant debate that is critical to predicting future sea level rise. Here we present a unique record of ice sheet elevation change derived from the Patriot Hills blue ice area (BIA), located close to the modern day grounding line of the Institute Ice Stream in the Weddell Sea Embayment (WSE). Combined analysis of ice gas volume and deuterium isotopic signatures allows us to develop a record of regional ice sheet palaeo-altitude change that can be assessed against independent regional high-resolution ice sheet modelling studies using PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.2572F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
