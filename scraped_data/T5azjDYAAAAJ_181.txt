Analyzing methane mixing and stable isotope ratios in air trapped in polar ice sheets helps in reconstructing the evolution of its sources and sinks in the past. This is important to improve predictions of atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios in the future under the influence of a changing climate. We present an attempt to reconcile methane stable isotopes \u03b413C (CH4) and \u03b4D (CH4) records from 11 (for \u03b413C (CH4)) and 5 (for \u03b4D (CH4)) boreholes in firn from both Greenland and Antarctica to reconstruct a consistent methane atmospheric history over the last 50 years. In the firn, the atmospheric signal is altered mainly by diffusion and gravitation. These processes are taken into account by firn air transport models. We show that for \u03b413C (CH4) the atmospheric signal is of the same order of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.6936S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
