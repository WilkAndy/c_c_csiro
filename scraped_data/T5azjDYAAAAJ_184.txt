Early pioneering work established that methane mixing ratios increased dramatically during the industrial revolution, that mixing ratios during the last ice age were lower than during the Holocene, and a strong link between methane and orbital precession. Increasingly longer, more detailed, and more precise data sets now give us a relatively complete picture of the atmospheric methane history over the last 800,000 years. The largest changes happen at terminations-the transitions from glacial to interglacial state that happened approximately every 100,000 years over this time period. The transition from glacial to interglacial levels happen over several thousand years, but a substantial fraction of the change for most terminations occurs over a much shorter time scale at the very end of the warming \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.U33A..03B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
