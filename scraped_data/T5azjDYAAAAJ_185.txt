For instance, recent research has pointed out a tight linkage of the atmospheric concentration of the NMHC ethane to the atmospheric growth rate of methane, and this relationship has been used to infer global changes in methane emission sources. Furthermore, NMHC play a pivotal role in photochemical production of ozone in the troposphere. We reconstructed the 1950-2010 Northern Hemisphere concentrations of the NMHC ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane using 1. measurements of air samples extracted from three boreholes in the firn layer at North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) project site; 2. a firn air transport model that allows reconstructing atmospheric concentrations of trace gas from borehole measurements; and 3. eight \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013EGUGA..15.3493H/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
