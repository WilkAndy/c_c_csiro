It has both natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural processes include uptake by plants, while oceans, wetlands, volcanism and biomass burning all contribute to natural COS emissions. We have measured COS in Antarctic ice cores from Dronning Maud Land, drilled in 1998, the DE08 core drilled at Law Dome in 1987, and the DSS0506 core drilled in 2006. Ice samples with COS gas ages between about 1050 AD and the early 20th centrury have been examined. A large volume ice crusher at the CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research laboratory was used to extract air from bubbles occluded in the ice cores. These air samples were analysed for CO2, CH4, CO and 13CO2 at CSIRO, and then for COS and several halocarbons at the University of East \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace101.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/6408", "cites_per_year": {}}
