We have performed new measurements of 13C of CO2 extracted from ice, incorporated the results from new firn sampling campaigns in Antarctica and merged them with a revised version of the previous \u03b413C-CO2 measurements [Francey et al., 1999]. Our new measurements from Law Dome ice increase the temporal sampling density over the last 200 years and show good agreement with the results from South Pole firn, providing evidence that our new record reliably extend the Cape Grim \u03b413C-CO2 record back in time. We also show the preliminary measurements aimed at covering the preindustrial period with higher sample density, including the 10 ppm CO2 decrease observed in ice from Law \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.C54B..07R/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
