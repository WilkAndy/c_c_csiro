Here we present calculations with a globally-aggregated carbon cycle model looking at both natural variability and the industrial perturbation in CO 2 and \u03b4 13 CO 2. We investigate the use of observations of CO 2,{} 13 CO 2 and {} 14 CO 2 to calibrate the Simple Carbon-Climate Model (SCCM), including the implications of the slightly lower preindustrial \u03b4 13 C levels in the latest record. We also present a Kalman filter double deconvolution that uses CO 2 and \u03b4 13 CO 2 measurements to infer net fluxes of CO 2 between the atmosphere, land and oceans, focussing on decadal variability over the industrial period and century-scale variations back to 1000 AD. We will compare the results of the double deconvolution with calculations of SCCM forced with temperature variations to improve our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFM.C51D0797T/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
