The development and recovery of the 2012 ozone hole will be shown via a set of metrics based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the Earth Observing Satellite (EOS) Aura. Other observational results will be shown to complement these satellite data. The 2012 ozone hole metrics will be compared to the historical metrics, and these will be linearly regressed against Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) data. The EESC data are based entirely on Cape Grim Air Archive, Antarctic firn and AGAGE global measurements of ozone depleting substances, and are calculated using the new formulation outlined in Newman et al.(2006) and Newman et al.(2007).
