Using the Law Dome \u03b413CH4 ice core record and published reconstructions of historic anthropogenic methane emissions (EDGAR-HYDE) we specifically model the natural variability of biogenic versus pyrogenic methane sources since 1700 CE In order to examine the influence of short-term climate variability on these sources, we quantify our findings against maps of proxie-based global temperature reconstructions to identify crucial regions for methane production. Independent \u03b413CH4 data from Mount Erebus Saddle, Ross Island, Antarctica, are used to verify the variability observed in the Law Dome record."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EGUGA..14.3868S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
