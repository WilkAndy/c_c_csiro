This can not be explained by the inter-hemispheric gradient expected for past climatic conditions. Instead, it is attributed to chemical reactions between impurities in the ice, contributing excess CO2 to the atmospheric signal which was initially trapped in the bubbles. This is consistent with the fact that Greenland ice contains a significantly higher amount of impurities compared to Antarctic ice. Different candidates of CO2 producing chemical reactions were suggested by previous studies:(i) the acidification of carbonates,(ii) the oxidation of hydrocarbons and (iii) the photodecarboxilation of humic like substances. However, there is no agreement on how much each of the above reactions contributes. This study aims to identify the contribution from organic and inorganic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EGUGA..1410927J/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
