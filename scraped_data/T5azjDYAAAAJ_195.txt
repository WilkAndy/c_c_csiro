The enzymatic microbial production processes favor 14 N over 15 N, whereby kinetic isotope fractionation results in the distinct isotope fingerprints of the N 2 O sources: natural versus anthropogenic sources and nitrification versus denitrification. Long-term decreasing trends in \u03b4 15 N, \u03b4 15 N \u03b1, and \u03b4 15 N \u03b2 (ie, the central\" \u03b1\" and terminal\" \u03b2\" nitrogen positions in NNO), and \u03b4 18 O of N 2 O observed in Antarctic firn air and archived air samples from Cape Grim, Tasmania, from 1940 to 2005 [Park et al., 2008], confirm that the anthropogenic source must be substantially isotopically lighter in 15 N than the natural (or pre-industrial) source, as previously inferred from N 2 O soil emissions isotope measurements in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AGUFM.B44A..04P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
