In 1971, under conditions when the boundary layer and the free troposphere were mixing strongly, Graeme Pearman and John Garratt, members of CSIRO\u2019s Agricultural Meteorology team, measured near free-tropospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a wheat crop at Rutherglen, Victoria. This lead to the establishment in 1972 of an innovative air sampling and CO2 measurement capability (Pearman and Garratt, 1972), collecting air samples from the free troposphere over southern Australia (Tasman Sea, Bass Strait, Great Australian Bight) and analysing them on a Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR) CO2 analyser at CSIRO\u2019s Division of Meteorological Physics, Aspendale (Fig. 1)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cawcr.gov.au/technical-reports/CTR_044.pdf#page=34", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uQDif-kTjvIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
