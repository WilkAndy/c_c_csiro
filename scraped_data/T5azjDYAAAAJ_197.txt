Because of the characteristics of the Law Dome ice core, the record features relatively high intrinsic time resolution, small diffusional artefacts and overlap with modern direct atmospheric records and firn measurements. The record has yet to be improved because ice cores are the only natural archive to directly store samples of the past atmosphere in their bubbles and no better cores have been drilled or measured covering the last 1000 years. The CO2 and \u03b413CO2 records have provided a powerful constraint for models simulating the global C cycle (eg: Trudinger et al., 1999). One of the most important conclusions one can draw from that dataset is that the CO2 released into the atmosphere during the industrial period has a 13C-depleted source (\u03b413CO2 lower than the mean atmospheric value).However, further measurements are needed to explain the causes of significant changes in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (for example, during the little ice age, around 1600 AD (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006)), which have since become the focus of studies of C-cycle variability (eg: Cox and Jones, 2008), as well as to extend the record into previous millennia."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://dspace101.ansto.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/10238/9645/1/CTR_044.pdf#page=79", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MCl8Eo9V2tEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
