The enclosed air has unparalleled age resolution and extends into recent decades, because of the high rate of snow accumulation at the ice core sites. The CO2 data overlap with the record from direct atmospheric measurements for up to 20 years. The effects of diffusion in the firn on the CO2 mixing ratio and age of the ice core air were determined by analyzing air sampled from the surface down to the bubble close\u2010off depth. The uncertainty of the ice core CO2 mixing ratios is 1.2 ppm (1 \u03c3). Preindustrial CO2 mixing ratios were in the range 275\u2013284 ppm, with the lower levels during 1550\u20131800 A.D., probably as a result of colder global climate. Natural CO2 variations of this magnitude make it inappropriate to refer to a single preindustrial CO2 level \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 1501, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16482733830078198898", "cites_id": ["16482733830078198898"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/95jd03410", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cvQf1RZvvuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 9, "1997": 24, "1998": 18, "1999": 31, "2000": 36, "2001": 40, "2002": 40, "2003": 40, "2004": 48, "2005": 52, "2006": 67, "2007": 49, "2008": 48, "2009": 70, "2010": 63, "2011": 74, "2012": 50, "2013": 67, "2014": 69, "2015": 66, "2016": 82, "2017": 61, "2018": 71, "2019": 76, "2020": 80, "2021": 63, "2022": 55, "2023": 18}}
