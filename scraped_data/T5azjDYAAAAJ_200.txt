Using atmospheric CH4 measurements to estimate CH4 emissions requires a good understanding of how CH4 is transported in the atmosphere.  Hence, simulations of atmospheric CH4 concentration have been made with  two  atmospheric  models,  namely  ACCESS  and  CCAM,  as  part  of  the  Transport Model Intercomparison project, TransCom-CH4.  The simulations ran for the period 1990-2008 and used six different sets of surface CH4 emissions, while the chemical CH4 sink was  modelled  using  prescribed  OH  and  stratospheric loss  fields.    Radon,  sulphur hexafluoride and methyl chloroform tracers were also simulated.  Model output has been analysed for two Australian sites with in-situ CH4 measurements: Cape Grim, Tasmania (AGAGE in-situ data) and the CO2CRC Otway project, Victoria.  Cape Grim is a coastal site, observing periods of clean (baseline) air from the Southern Ocean and periods of non-baseline  air,  influenced  by  emissions  from  South  Eastern  Australia  including Melbourne.  Otway  is  a  rural  location,  4  km  from  the  coast,  where  the  land  use  is predominantly  dairy  farming,  resulting  in  a  large  local  CH4  signal  from  enteric fermentation (diurnal amplitudes up to 250 ppb). Nevertheless, during well mixed periods, measured  CH4  concentrations  at  Otway  may  be  similar  to  the  baseline  CH4 concentrations  measured  at  Cape  Grim  or  represent  broader  regional  South  Eastern Australian emissions. Preliminary findings indicate that CH4 at Otway and non-baseline CH4 at Cape Grim are sensitive to the choice of wetland emissions.
