Storage directly in the ocean, where CO2 can form deposits as liquid CO2, solid CO2-H20 clathrates, or dissolve in seawater (Brewer et al. 1999, Warzinski et al. 2006), is becoming less likely due to questions of storage longevity and concerns about acidification and ecosystem impacts (Barry et al. 2004, P\u00f6rtner et al. 2005). Such storage is not allowed under international conventions, such as OSPAR, the Oslo and Paris Conventions for the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. Storage of the captured CO2 by forming minerals or by enhanced weathering also appears to have limited opportunities.The recent IEA Technology Roadmap (IEA 2009) concludes that CCS will need to contribute 19 per cent of emissions reductions to reach a total of 50 per cent emissions reductions by 2050 under the most cost effective portfolio of solutions. Actual progress is slow, however, with mainly pilot scale projects or small scale operational projects being developed at well below the rate needed to make such reductions (Haszeldine 2009; Global CCS Institute 2009). Only about 100 MT CO2 is likely to be stored globally by 2015. Limits to progress are less related to storage capacity and other technical matters than to commercial, regulatory, or public acceptance challenges (Haszeldine 2009). Both carbon pricing and enforced emission policies will be required to encourage CCS (Haszeldine 2009; Global CCS Institute \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=e0a0c17d6403e368eb84cc86f9803e7025e4f58a#page=57", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cdrywU3Wzu8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
