The atmospheric monitoring is being developed to detect and quantify potential leakage, though most of the variations in CO2 at Otway are due to ecological fluxes. At this site we have been making continuous measurements of CO2 with a high-precision non-dispersive infrared analyzer system (Da Costa and Steele, 1999; Francey and Steele, 2003) since January 2007, and in November 2009 we added two wavelength-scanned cavity ring-down spectrometers (CRDS)(Picarro Inc.), providing continuous measurements of 12CO2, 12CH4, H2O and 12/13CO2. In this paper, we will use one year of overlapping data for these instruments to compare their relative precisions, stabilities and calibration regimes.
