Contrary to ice cores, large sample volumes can be pumped from the firn, making this archive especially suited for studying changes in the isotopic composition of atmospheric trace gases. At the NEEM deep drilling site in northern Greenland firn air has been sampled from 4 different bore holes during two field campaigns. Through a collaboration of several laboratories NEEM firn air has been analyzed for an unprecedented number of analytes, including isotopes of CO2, CH4, N2O, CO and H2. The atmospheric signal as recorded in the firn is affected by a number of processes such as diffusion, advection and gravitational enrichment. Modeling of gas transport is therefore essential for the interpretation of firn gas records. For the NEEM site there is a joint effort to derive the firn transport properties by \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010EGUGA..12.8205B/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
