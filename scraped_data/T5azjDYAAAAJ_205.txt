Abstract \nCarbon monoxide (CO) plays a key role in global atmospheric chemistry by being the main \nsink of atmospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH). The relatively short CO atmospheric lifetime (about \n2 months) together with larger emissions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) currently result in a \nlarge interhemispheric [CO] gradient (1). Reliable records of past [CO] from both hemispheres \nare therefore essential for understanding past changes in atmospheric [OH] as well as \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009EGUGA..11.6506P/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:3he7acrxJMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
