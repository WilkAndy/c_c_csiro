Prior to 1900, methane C13 varies around-49 per mille, with changes of about 0.5 per mille over a few decades. After 1900, when methane concentrations begin to rise rapidly, C13e rises as well. After 1950, when methane concentrations increase very rapidly, C13 rises sharply as well. Both C13 and concentration have been level for the last several years. Using a simple model of the methane cycle with four sources, biomass burning, fossil fuels, aerobic plants release, and anaerobic sources and two sinks, hydroxyl and chlorine radical, we investigate the importance of climate changes and anthropogenic sources on the methane cycle during the last few centuries. We assume constant sinks, and prescribe histories for two of the four sources, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.B11E..07W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
