Further, Greenland ice core records show substantial increases in methane concentrations associated with many of the abrupt warming events during the last glacial period. The two largest rapid methane perturbations occurred at the ends of the Younger Dryas (~ 500 to 750 ppb) and the Oldest Dryas (~ 500 to 650 ppb) intervals during the last glacial termination. Recent ice core methane \u03b413C and \u03b4D studies have been able to put constraints on paleo methane budgets. We are conducting 14CH4 measurements on several large (~ 100 L) air samples from Greenland ice dating to the Younger Dryas-Preboreal and Oldest Dryas-B\\olling climatic transitions, to further constrain the methane budgets for these periods and provide a definitive test of the hypothesis that methane clathrates \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUFM.U33C..05P/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
