(2006; Nature 439, 187\u2013191) demonstrated CH4 emission from living and dead plant tissues under aerobic conditions. This work included some calculations to extrapolate the findings from the laboratory to the global scale and led various commentators to question the value of planting trees as a greenhouse mitigation option. The experimental work of Keppler et al. (2006) appears to be largely sound, although some concerns remain about the quantification of emission rates. However, whilst accepting their basic findings, we are critical of the method used for extrapolating results to a global scale. Using the same basic information, we present alternative calculations to estimate global aerobic plant CH4 emissions as 10\u201360\u2009Mt CH4 year\u20131. This estimate is much smaller than the 62\u2013236\u2009Mt CH4 year\u20131 reported in the original study and can be more readily reconciled within the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 132, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5024727886285020888", "cites_id": ["5024727886285020888"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/fp/fp06051", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2J4E82Nru0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 23, "2008": 21, "2009": 19, "2010": 13, "2011": 5, "2012": 13, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 6, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
