BackgroundExploration and production of oil and gas has recently been proposed for several areas offshore Northwest Tasmania. This is part of a large increase in the development of reserves expected in the South East Australian region. Emissions from these activities could affect the measurements of atmospheric compounds at the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station, which was established there because of the remoteness from significant local anthropogenic emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/baseline_2001-2002.pdf#page=22", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wfEqq0M22iQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
