We measured d13CH4 in air extracted from Antarctic ice cores and firn and in air archived from Cape Grim, Tasmania. This was done using a newly developed GC-IRMS technique that analyses very small air samples with high precision. The results show that d13CH4 increased over the past century, consistent with the addition of isotopically enriched sources from anthropogenic activity. However a large increase (about 1.5 per mil) in d13CH4 from 1700AD back to about 1500AD was also observed. This was quite unexpected as it was previously assumed, based on the small observed changes in methane concentration, that the pre-anthropogenic methane budget was approximately in balance. Explanations for the cause of this d13CH4 increase invoke changes in enriched sources such as biomass \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AGUFM.A42D..07E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
