By selecting a site on Law Dome where the diffusive column is only 40 metres deep, we have obtained firn air with an age spectral width (analogous to the standard deviation of the age distribution) of only about 5 years, while the oldest effective age is about 60 years. An associated advantage is the small isotopic fractionation (maximum gravitational enrichment is 0.17 per mil per molecular mass unit difference). These samples have been used to provide records of species with rapid changes in the atmosphere, such as halocarbons and methane isotopic ratios. Measurements of firn air samples from South Pole (age spectral width 18 years) extend the record to the early 1900s. In particular, firn forward modelling of atmospheric scenarios, constrained by the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002EGSGA..27.5157E/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
