We report on preliminary results for some of the synthetic halocarbons measured by GC-MS analysis. These measurements supplement a number of existing reconstructed histories for the 20th century from analyses of firn air samples collected in both Greenland and Antarctica. As a result, these species, less hindered by issues such as instabilities in the firn or during storage, already have fairly well characterised histories. The reconstructed time trends can ultimately be used to gain knowledge on past budgets and lifetimes of the measured species, on histories of radiative forcing from measured greenhouse gases and on atmospheric halogen loading. This is illustrated with some results from an earlier study on firn air from Law Dome, Antarctica."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002EGSGA..27.3075S/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
