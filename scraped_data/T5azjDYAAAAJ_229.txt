An additional vertical profile was obtained over Charles Point to the west of Darwin in conjunction with the Pacific Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (PACE-6) in September 1998. Sampling strategies and procedures were largely unchanged from previous years. Minor changes were implemented in line with a change of aircraft for regular flights and to commence regular GC-MS measurements of halogenated species at Cape Grim."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/baseline_1997-1998.pdf#page=81", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nPoNfXyi8UUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
