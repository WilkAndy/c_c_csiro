However, the contributions of the various methane sources and sinks to the CH increase are poorly understood. Here we use initial emissions from bottom-up inventories for anthropogenic sources, emissions from wetlands and rice paddies simulated by a terrestrial biogeochemical model, and an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM)-based chemistry-transport model (i.e. ACTM) to simulate atmospheric CH concentrations for 1910\u20132010. The ACTM simulations are compared with the CH concentration records reconstructed from Antarctic and Arctic ice cores and firn air samples, and from direct measurements since the 1980s at multiple sites around the globe. The differences between ACTM simulations and observed CH concentrations are minimized to optimize the global total emissions using a mass balance calculation. During 1910\u20132010, the global total CH emission doubled from 290 to 580\u202fTg\u202fyr. Compared to optimized emission, the bottom-up emission data set underestimates the rate of change of global total CH emissions by 30\u202f% during the high growth period of 1940\u20131990, while it overestimates by 380\u202f% during the low growth period of 1990\u20132010. Further, using the CH stable carbon isotopic data (C), we attribute the emission increase during 1940\u20131990 primarily to enhancement of biomass burning. The total lifetime of CH shortened from 9.4\u202fyr during 1910\u20131919 to 9\u202fyr during 2000\u20132009 by the combined effect of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2264972750742614345", "cites_id": ["2264972750742614345"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/15/2595/2015/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SfHzabfMbh8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 17, "2017": 13, "2018": 15, "2019": 15, "2020": 21, "2021": 16, "2022": 21, "2023": 5}}
