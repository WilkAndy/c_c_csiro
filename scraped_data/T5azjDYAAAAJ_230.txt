In this paper we present our first result s of {sup 10}Be concentrations measured in the ice and firn from samples spanning this century and taken from three cores with up to a seven-fold variation in accumulation rate. In combination with a well established ice chronology, this has enabled a study of the relationship between the snow accumulation rate and the measured {sup 10}Be concentration. Preliminary results suggest that, for Law Dome, the 10 Be concentration is independent of accumulation rate and that most {sup 10}Be is incorporated into the ice sheet as a result of 'wet' precipitation. Questions concerning the degree to which {sup 10}Be is adsorbed on dust particles or present as a soluble form have complicated the interpretation of the {sup 10}Be record in Northern Hemisphere ice cores. To better understand the implications for Law Dome ice we have undertaken two pilot experiments. One experiment involved measurement of the short lived radioisotope {sup 7}Be along with {sup 10}Be in surface snow samples in an attempt to elucidate transport effects. The second experiment was aimed at determination of the partitioning of {sup 10}Be among terrestrial dust particles of different."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20065467", "cites_per_year": {}}
