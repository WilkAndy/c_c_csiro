These gases may also play a role in the forcing of climate change by altering the infrared radiative budget of the at mosphere. Such source gases are emitted as a result of naturally occurring processes or as a result of human activity and have lifetimes ranging from days to centuries. Chapter 1 of this Assessment focuses on\" long-lived\" source gases whose atmospheric photochemical destruction occurs predominantly (if not exclusively) in the stratosphere, and which thus tend to have lifetimes on the order of many years. The present chapter deals with the\" short-lived\" subset of ozone-related source gases that undergo significant chemical destruction in the troposphere, occurring primarily via reaction with tropospheric hydroxyl radicals (OH) or (as in the case of some iodine-containing compounds) via photolysis at wavelengths longer than 300 nanometers (nm). The lifetimes of these species tend to be shorter, ranging from days to several years. However, to keep the discussion together for all gases primarily destroyed through reaction with OH, the much longer-lived HFC-23 (CHF3) also is included in this chapter. The present and future budgets of the source gases within this combined suite strongly influence the chemical composition of the Earth's atmosphere and determine the atmospheric concentrations of free radicals, which define the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://csl.noaa.gov/assessments/ozone/1998/chapters/chapter2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:80iimMpVR14J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
