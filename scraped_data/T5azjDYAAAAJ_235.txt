The first few S13C numbers also actually produced initial ambiguous results, but the weight of additional measurements produced a clearer picture. We hypothesized that some combination of lab precision and field variability may have contributed to uncertainty with few initial data points. In this study, soil was sampled from the location of eight new circular plots (23-m-diameter plots embedded in a ca. 9 ha farm field) just prior to the beginning of 1995-1996 FACE experiments with wheat. Each plot was sampled with at least four soil cores taken along equally spaced radii from the center and at depths of both 0-30 cm and 30-60 cm; in the case of two of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/viewFile/1855/1856", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_xoLeWOq4V8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
