Estimates of budgets and lifetimes are required to pre dict future impacts. Likewise, these data are needed to accurately predict what levels of emission reductions are needed in order to stabilize and/or reduce present con centrations. In this assessment we will deal with gases emitted by natural and/or anthropogenic sources that in fluence the chemical composition of the atmosphere. It includes long-lived gases that contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion (ie, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), ha lons, nitrous oxide (N20)) and/or radiative forcing of the atmosphere (ie, carbon dioxide (C02), CFCs, methane (CH4), N20), and short-lived compounds that are in volved in the 03 chemistry of the troposphere (ie, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non methane hydrocarbons). Reduced sulfur gases are important in the formation of tropospheric aerosols and therefore in the climate system; however, these com pounds are not included in this Chapter and the reader is referred to Chapter 3 of the IPCC 1994 Interim Report for an updated discussion of these source gases. The cur rent concentrations and recent trends of long-lived gases are summarized in Table 2-1. Lifetimes (ie, total global burden of the gas divided by its globally integrated sink strength) are also given."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://csl.noaa.gov/assessments/ozone/1994/chapters/chapter2.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FveYqrpH1dcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
