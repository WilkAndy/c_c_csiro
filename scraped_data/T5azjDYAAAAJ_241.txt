To better understand the dynamics of N2O in the atmosphere over the last century, we have reconstructed the mole fraction, \u03b415Nbulk, \u03b418O, and \u03b415NSP values of N2O from ice cores, firn air archives, and modern atmospheric samples. We have provided new firn air records from the Styx Glacier, Antarctica, and the North Greenland Eemian Ice drilling Project, and updated the firn air transport modeling of the published records. The composite reconstruction shows that the N2O growth rates were 0.26\u00b10.05, 0.15\u00b10.05 and 0.75\u00b10.01 ppb yr\u20101 during 1850\u20131930 (P1), 1931\u20131965 (P2) and 1966\u20132021 CE (P3), respectively. The temporal slope found in a linear least\u2010squares fit in \u03b415Nbulk and \u03b418O were \u20100.010\u00b10.025 and \u20100.004\u00b10.031 \u2030 yr\u20101, \u20100.014\u00b10.013 and \u20100.009\u00b10.017 \u2030 yr \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:4xDN1ZYqzskC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JD038281", "cites_per_year": {}}
