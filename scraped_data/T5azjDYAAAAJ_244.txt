Its role as a precursor for stratospheric sulphate aerosols, which catalyse the destruction of ozone (O 3)(Andreae and Crutzen, 1997), makes it an important gas to quantify contemporarily and characterise historically. The atmospheric COS budget is highly complex, with contributions from a wide range of both natural and anthropogenic processes (Sturges et al., 2001)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:a3BOlSfXSfwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Thornton-7/publication/277957608_A_record_of_carbonyl_sulphide_COS_from_Antarctic_ice_over_the_last_700_years/links/5fb4661345851518fdb07d4c/A-record-of-carbonyl-sulphide-COS-from-Antarctic-ice-over-the-last-700-years.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vwdUUyAUARIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
