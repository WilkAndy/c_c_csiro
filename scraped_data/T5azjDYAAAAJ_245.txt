These 30 measurements are used in combination with the AGAGE 2-D atmospheric 12-box model and a 31 Bayesian inversion methodology to determine model atmospheric mole fractions and the history 32 of global HFC-23 emissions. The global modelled annual mole fraction of HFC-23 in the 33 background atmosphere was 28.9\u00b10.6 pmol mol-1 at the end of 2016, representing a 28% 34 increase from 22.6\u00b10.4 pmol mol-1 in 2009. Over the same time frame, the modelled mole 35 fraction of HCFC-22 increased by 19% from 199\u00b12 pmol mol-1 to 237\u00b12 pmol mol-1. 36 However, unlike HFC-23, the annual average HCFC-22 growth rate slowed from 2009 to 2016 37 at an annual average rate of-0.5 pmol mol-1 yr-2. This slowing atmospheric growth is consistent 38 with HCFC-22 moving from dispersive (high fractional emissions) to feedstock (low fractional 39 emissions) uses, with HFC-23 emissions remaining as a consequence of incomplete mitigation 40 from all HCFC-22 production. 41"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2017-929/acp-2017-929.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XcBn4_Vv8CcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
