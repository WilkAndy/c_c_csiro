Recent evidence3 confirms earlier indications4 that the low CO2 was caused by increased terrestrial carbon storage. It remains unknown whether the terrestrial biosphere responded to temperature variations, or there was vegetation re-\u2010growth on abandoned farmland5. Here we present a global numerical simulation of atmospheric carbonyl sulfide in the pre-\u2010industrial period. Carbonyl sulfide concentration is linked to changes in gross primary production6 and shows a positive anomaly7 during the Little Ice Age. We show that a decrease in gross primary production and a larger decrease in ecosystem respiration is the most likely explanation for the CO2 decrease and carbonyl sulfide increase. Therefore, temperature change, not vegetation re-\u2010growth, was the main cause for the increased terrestrial carbon storage. We address the inconsistency between ice core CO2 records from different sites8 measuring CO2 and \u03b4 13CO2 in ice from Dronning Maud Land(Antarctica). Our interpretation allows us to derive the temperature sensitivity of pre-\u2010industrial CO2 fluxes for the terrestrial biosphere(\u03b3L=-\u201010 to-\u201090 PgC K-\u20101), implying a positive climate feedback and providing a benchmark to reduce model uncertainties9.Models of future carbon cycle-\u2010climate changes predict a large range in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, mainly because of uncertainties in the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to the future temperature increase9.
