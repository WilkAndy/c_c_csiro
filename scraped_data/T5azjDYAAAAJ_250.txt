The Little Ice Age (LIA, 1500-1750 AD) CO2 decrease [MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Etheridge et al., 1996] is the most significant pre-industrial atmospheric change over the last millennia and has been used to derive the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle. While a recent study [Bauska et al., 2016] confirms previous evidence [Trudinger et al., 1999] that pre-industrial CO2 variations were caused by changes in land carbon stores, there are open questions about the size of the atmospheric LIA CO2 decrease reconstructed from ice cores, and about what caused the land to sequester CO2. To quantify the size of the LIA CO2 decrease, we have produced new CO2 measurements from DML ice that support the DSS LIA CO2decrease as a real atmospheric feature. To partition the contribution of ocean and land, we have measured the \u03b413C-CO2, showing that the cause of the CO2 drop was uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. To identify whether the land uptake was caused by temperature, or by a decline in farming due to pandemics, we have simulated the effect of a temperature perturbation on atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS). In agreement with the previously published positive COS anomaly, our results indicate that Global Primary Productivity (GPP) decreased during the LIA, ruling out the early anthropogenic land use change hypothesis as the dominant cause of increased terrestrial carbon storage.
