Here we discuss how we reconstruct the past atmospheric history of trace gases, taking account of the processes in firn and ice that affect the enclosed air. We present our latest reconstructions of perfluorocarbons [Trudinger et al., 2016; M\u00fchle et al., in preparation], halons [Vollmer et al., 2016], carbon monoxide (Etheridge et al., in prep), minor CFCs [Vollmer et al., in preparation] and SO2F2 [M\u00fchle et al., in preparation] using firn and ice core measurements from combinations of Antarctic and Greenland sites, specifically DE08, DE08-2 and DSSW20K from Law Dome, South Pole 2001, NEEM 2008, EDML, Megadunes, Summit 2013 and ABN. We also derive global emissions for some of these trace gases. Our reconstructions provide information on background/pre-anthropogenic levels. We demonstrate the advantage of locations with narrow air-age resolution\u2013for example, we are able to resolve small peaks in emissions of perfluorocarbons CF4 and C2F6 due to aluminium production during World War II from the high-resolution DE08 and DE08-2 ice core measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://apo.ansto.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/10238/8438/2/ACCOMC_CGASM2016_Program_Abstracts_FINAL(1).pdf#page=16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O5gglB2uVYwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
