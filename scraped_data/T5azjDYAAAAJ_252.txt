The station is part of a collaborative project between Geoscience Australia (GA) and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) to establish and operate a high precision atmospheric monitoring facility for measurement of baseline greenhouse gases (GHG) in a high priority geological carbon dioxide storage region. The primary purpose of the station is to field test newly developed greenhouse gas monitoring technology and demonstrate best practice for regional baseline atmospheric monitoring appropriate for geological storage of carbon dioxide. The GHG records were to be used as a reference for monitoring of the atmosphere at a CO2 storage project, providing a baseline to quantify typical variations in the area and a background against which any anomalies in the immediate vicinity of the storage might be detected.The site chosen for the GHG atmospheric monitoring station is in the locality of Arcturus, 50 km southeast of Emerald in the Central Highlands, Queensland. Site selection was based on the recommendations of the Carbon Storage Taskforce\u2019s National Carbon Mapping and Infrastructure Plan, regional assessments of prospective basins, regional atmospheric modelling, and consultation with key stakeholders. The key driver for the stakeholder consultation group was to support early projects for large scale onshore geological storage. Both the Bowen and Surat basins were identified as potential early mover onshore storage regions by the group and suitable for a regional atmospheric monitoring station \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10045437115222172032&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gKFXUtWPaIsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
