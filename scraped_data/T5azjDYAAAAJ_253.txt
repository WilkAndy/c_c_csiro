The 1980s were characterised by declining methane growth rates which were approximately 10 ppbv/yr by the end of the decade. The average growth rate of 13 ppbv/yr corresponds to an imbalance between sources and sinks of about 37 Tg (CH4)/yr. If emissions were frozen at this level, CH4 would rise to about 1900 ppbv over the next 50 years. If emissions were cut by 37 Tg (CH4)/yr, then CH4 concentrations would remain at today's levels. Current estimates of the CH4 budget assign 20-40% to natural sources, 20% to anthropogenic fossil fuel related sources and the remaining 40-60% to other anthropogenic sources.The annual CH4 increase from 1991 to 1992 was much smaller than in the previous decade, 1992 to 1993 levels were unchanged, and in late 1993 CH4 apparently started to increase again. This anomaly was largest at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, and could be explained by a rapid drop, of about 5%, in global annual emissions. Longer-period variations in the growth rate of CH4 have been observed for the 1920s and 1970s from air trapped in ice cores."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "ftp://halo.ess.uci.edu/public/prather/papers-MJP/055_1995IPCC_Prather-Chapter4-atmoschem.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZBlNshNlSB0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
