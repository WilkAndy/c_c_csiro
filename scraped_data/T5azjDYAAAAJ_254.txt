This was due to industrial activities and to a much-reduced extent to agricultural practices, which led to increases in the concentrations of chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, and hydrogen radicals in the stratosphere. These radicals are produced from long-lived source gases that, because their atmospheric lifetimes are long compared with the transport time to reach the stratosphere, are able to be transported intact into the stratosphere. The Montreal Protocol and its Amendments and Adjustments have, however, led to reductions in the tropospheric abundances of the chlorine-and bromine-containing source gases as a result of reductions in the production and consumption of manufactured halogenated source gases. Direct observations of most chemical species that cause stratospheric ozone depletion began in the late 1970s or later. The ground-based in situ and flask measurements have provided the most complete picture of the evolution of these species because of the regularity of the measurements. The complete 20th century and earlier pictures of the accumulation of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere also rely on calculations based on historic emission estimates, and analysis of air trapped in polar firn and ice or measurements of air archives. Ground-based remote sensing techniques, in particular numerous Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC, formerly Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change or NDSC) sites equipped with Fourier transform \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/~rnassar/Publications_pdfs/WMO-Chapter_1.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iOm-qUZAFvwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
