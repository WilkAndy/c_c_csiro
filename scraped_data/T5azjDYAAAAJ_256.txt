Ongoing areas of special effort include:\u2022 Closely coordinated sampling and analysis of the major atmospheric greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) and some related gas species (stable isotopes, O2/N2, CO, H2) that provide information about the greenhouse gas source and sink processes, referred to here as a \u201cmulti-species approach\u201d;\u2022 Development of \u201csmall-sample size\u201d requirements for sampling and analysis with outcomes of: a) understanding systematic biases that influence measurements, b) improving links to archived air samples that are dependent on small sample techniques, and c) addressing logistic constraints that hinder adequate spatial coverage in global \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11811265024433607266&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YlJcAfYK6qMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
