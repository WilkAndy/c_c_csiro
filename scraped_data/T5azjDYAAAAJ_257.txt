These isotopes undergo fractionation during atmospheric phase changes and diffusion processes and hence hold information about the condensation history of the parent air mass. Isotopic records constructed from samples of rainfall at a particular site or across small basins can use this as a diagnostic of the atmospheric processes contributing to the variability of the isotopic content of rainwater and inputs to local hydrology. The focus here is primarily upon how particular regional scale processes in the atmosphere are manifest in the isotopic record and how short term variabilty may in turn affect the interpretation of longer term isotopic measurements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://bibdigital.sid.inpe.br/cptec.inpe.br/adm_conf/2005/10.13.07.06", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AcxN7C1wg1QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
