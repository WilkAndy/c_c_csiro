The coverage over the relatively poorly observed southern hemisphere is of particular interest given that there is a greater dependence in this region upon the assimilation algorithms being used. A model that routinely incorporates reanalysis data is a version of NCAR-CAM3 that has recently been fitted with an isotopic module (Noone, personal communication). The scheme simulates the fractionation of the stable water isotopes H18"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://wgne.net/bluebook/uploads/2006/individual-articles/02_Barras_Vaughan_02_barras_vaughan_isoreanalysis.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xA9ijW4J_VAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
