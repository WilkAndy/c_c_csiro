The shared primary research targets are improved global budgets of atmospheric trace gases which are influenced by human activity and which, in turn, modify the environment (mainly climate). This report describes GASLAB and documents the nature of the many interactions between the two laboratories. It describes the analytical instrumentation, sampling techniques, and analytical strategies used by the laboratory. It concludes that GASLAB is meeting the objectives of improving the quality and expanding the relevance of Cape Grim programs, while Cape Grim remains an essential foundation for the GASLAB sampling and assessment programs. It is believed that a period of consolidation is required in GASLAB so that successfully proven prototype equipment and methods are fully transferred into an operational mode. This involves improved automation and further development of high quality-control monitoring and data processing.
