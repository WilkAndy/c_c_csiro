Once broken down mainly by the reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radicals, CH4 actively participates in air pollution chemistry in the troposphere and is the predominant source of water vapour in the stratosphere. The global abundance of atmospheric methane has increased from~ 900 ppb during the 1900s to~ 1800 ppb during the 2000s. During the same period, the anthropogenic CH4 emission has increased from 92 Tg/yr to about 321 Tg/yr (EDGAR-HYDE). However, much less is known about the cause of CH4 concentrations increase over the 20th centuries.The CCSR/NIES/FRCGC Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM)-based Chemistry Transport Model (ACTM)[Patra et al., 2009] is used to simulate CH4 concentrations for the period 1900 to 2010. The AGCM transport is simulated online using the interannually varying monthly-mean sea-surface temperature distributions from the Hadley Centre. We combined emissions from bottom-up inventories of annual-mean anthropogenic emissions from EDGAR-HYDE 1.4 [van Aardenne et al., 2001] and EDGAR 3.2 [Olivier and Berdowski, 2001], simulated monthly-mean sources from wetland and rice paddies using a terrestrial biogeochemical model (ie, VISIT [Ito and Inatomi, 2011]), and monthly varying biomass burning emissions from the GISS climatology [Fung et al., 1991]."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://nipr.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=pages_view_main&active_action=repository_view_main_item_detail&item_id=11347&item_no=1&page_id=13&block_id=104", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gjGmKuaoSUEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
