This study (the first of its kind in Australia) by the Cooperative Research Center for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) is to monitor the trial geo-sequestration of CO2 into the depleted gas field (Naylor Field) and to observe the environmental effects to determine the viability and effectiveness of CO2 geo-sequestration. LOFLO is an analysis system built around a commercial LI-COR 6251 optical bench which utilizes NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) gas analysis technology to measure CO2 concentrations in sample air. Consuming smaller volumes of calibration gases (approx. 15ml/min) and requiring much less operator intervention, LOFLO measurements have significantly less bias \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=144055324328107874&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
