This difference depends on the lock-in depth (LID), when air no longer mixes with the atmosphere. The LID can be estimated from firnification models or from the air isotopic composition (\u03b415N and \u03b440Ar). Both methods give consistent results for Greenland and one coastal site in Antarctica (Byrd). New firn measurements in Greenland (NorthGRIP) and Antarctica (Berkner Island, BAS depot, Dome C) confirm that firnification models correctly reproduce the present LID over a large range of surface conditions. However, a systematic mismatch is observed for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in East Antarctic sites (Vostok, Dome C, Dome F) questioning the model's validity.
