The species, all included in the Montreal Protocol, are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs \u201011, \u201012, \u2010113, \u2010114, \u2010115), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs \u201022, \u2010141b, \u2010142b), halons (H \u20101211, \u20101301), CH3CCl3 (methyl chloroform) and CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride). The measurements were used to reconstruct the atmospheric history of these species since the 1930s, providing a record considerably predating existing in situ records or other conventional air archives, encompassing virtually the entire history of anthropogenic emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, and halons and giving early 20th century levels for CH3CCl3 and CCl4. Significant features of this study are (1) the narrow age spread \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 108, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5187388658845601468", "cites_id": ["5187388658845601468"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002JD002548", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vM5hUoBO_UcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 9, "2005": 7, "2006": 5, "2007": 11, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 11, "2014": 5, "2015": 3, "2016": 9, "2017": 6, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
