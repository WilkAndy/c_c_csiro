A major feature of the ice core record is the decrease in CO2, and increase in \u03b413C, through the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d period (roughly 1550\u20131800). We show that this observed decrease in CO2 is consistent with the effect of decreased temperature on either terrestrial or oceanic exchange, however the increase in \u03b413C favors a terrestrial response to cooling. We perform single deconvolution model calculations which generally give good agreement with observed variations in CO2, \u03b413C and \u039414C data for different reservoirs and due to both natural and anthropogenic causes. The fit to prebomb \u039414C is improved by using an ice core 10Be record to represent the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 105, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15029804505745531951", "cites_id": ["15029804505745531951"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3402/tellusb.v51i2.16276", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LySHEJGXlNAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 5, "2000": 1, "2001": 5, "2002": 10, "2003": 5, "2004": 3, "2005": 7, "2006": 6, "2007": 10, "2008": 4, "2009": 3, "2010": 5, "2011": 6, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 6, "2020": 2, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
