The same samples were previously used by Etheridge and co\u2010workers to construct a high precision 1000\u2010year record of atmospheric CO2 concentration, featuring a close link between the ice and modern records and high\u2010time resolution. Here, we start by confirming the trend in the Cape Grim in situ \u03b413C record from 1982 to 1996, and extend it back to 1978 using the Cape Grim Air Archive. The firn air \u03b413C agrees with the Cape Grim record, but only after correction for gravitational separation at depth, for diffusion effects associated with disequilibrium between the atmosphere and firm, and allowance for a latidudinal gradient in \u03b413C between Cape Grim and the Antarctic coast. Complex calibration strategies are required to cope with several additional systematic influences on the ice core \u03b413C \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 894, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17459625725368289647,3357289924542200845", "cites_id": ["17459625725368289647", "3357289924542200845"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.t01-1-00005.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b0nZlxcNTfIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 11, "2000": 13, "2001": 10, "2002": 18, "2003": 18, "2004": 15, "2005": 22, "2006": 28, "2007": 31, "2008": 43, "2009": 31, "2010": 56, "2011": 43, "2012": 49, "2013": 74, "2014": 46, "2015": 41, "2016": 55, "2017": 52, "2018": 38, "2019": 57, "2020": 48, "2021": 46, "2022": 29, "2023": 13}}
