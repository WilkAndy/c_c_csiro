The most prominent feature of the pre\u2010industrial period is a rapid \u223c7 ppm decrease of CO2 in a span of \u223c20\u201350 years at \u223c1600 A.D. This observation confirms the timing of an abrupt atmospheric CO2 decrease of \u223c10 ppm observed for that time period in the Law Dome ice core CO2 records, but the true magnitude of the decrease remains unclear. Atmospheric CO2 variations over the time period 1000\u20131800 A.D. are statistically correlated with northern hemispheric climate and tropical Indo\u2010Pacific sea surface temperature. However, the exact relationship between CO2 and climate remains elusive due to regional climate variations and/or uneven geographical data density of paleoclimate records. We observe small differences of 0 \u223c 2% (0 \u223c \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=461013476687845302", "cites_id": ["461013476687845302"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2011GB004247", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tpelglDZZQYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 9, "2014": 8, "2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 11, "2018": 5, "2019": 10, "2020": 13, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 2}}
