A similar history is obtained from air pumped from different layers of the firn at Law Dome, Antarctica, after correction for diffusion and gravitational settling effects in the firn. The archive records are linked to measurements since 1992 using 5\u2010L glass flasks filled at Cape Grim, and compared to data since 1989 from a comparable site at Baring Head, New Zealand. Over 18 years the \u03b413C of atmospheric methane in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere has increased by \u223c0.6\u2030 while the methane mixing ratio increased by \u223c200 ppb. The \u03b413C growth rate decreases over the 18\u2010year period, but by relatively less than the simultaneous decrease in mixing ratio growth rate. The overall increase in \u03b413C is significantly smaller than, and the recent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC", "num_citations": 85, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16871162941403766355", "cites_id": ["16871162941403766355"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1999JD900357", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ux4b1k5pIuoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 8, "2001": 7, "2002": 12, "2003": 3, "2004": 8, "2005": 9, "2006": 1, "2007": 6, "2008": 0, "2009": 5, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 2}}
