(2006) discovered a surprising new source of methane \u2013 terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions, with an estimated global production of 62\u2013236 Tg yr\u22121 by an unknown mechanism. This is ~10\u201340% of the annual total of methane entering the modern atmosphere and ~30\u2013100% of annual methane entering the pre-industrial (0 to 1700 AD) atmosphere. Here we test this reported global production of methane from plants against ice core records of atmospheric methane concentration (CH4) and stable carbon isotope ratios (\u03b413CH4) over the last 2000 years. Our top-down approach determines that global plant emissions must be much lower than proposed by Keppler et al. (2006) during the last 2000 years and are likely to lie in the range 0\u201346 Tg yr\u22121 and 0\u2013176 Tg yr\u22121 during the pre-industrial and modern eras, respectively."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC", "num_citations": 83, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13373759082825473726", "cites_id": ["13373759082825473726"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/7/237/2007/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vl53UwcjmbkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 9, "2008": 11, "2009": 16, "2010": 10, "2011": 7, "2012": 9, "2013": 3, "2014": 6, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
