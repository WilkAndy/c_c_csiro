The firn air at this site has a relatively narrow age spread, giving high time resolution reconstructions. The CH3Br reconstructions confirm previously measured firn records but with more temporal structure. Our CH3Cl reconstruction is slightly different from previous reconstructions, raising some questions about CH3Cl in the firn. Our reconstructions for CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 are the first published records of concentration prior to direct atmospheric measurements. A two\u2010box atmospheric model is used to investigate the budgets of these gases. Much of the variation in CH3Cl can be explained by biomass burning emissions that increase up to 1980 and then are relatively stable apart from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 79, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2681971071436401694", "cites_id": ["2681971071436401694"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004JD004932", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HizX0npGOCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 4, "2007": 12, "2008": 4, "2009": 6, "2010": 5, "2011": 5, "2012": 4, "2013": 4, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 4, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
