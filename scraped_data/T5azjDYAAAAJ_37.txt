These records come from a number of ice core and firn air sites and have been measured in several laboratories around the world and show common features but also unresolved differences. Here we present revised records, including new measurements, performed at the CSIRO Ice Core Extraction LABoratory (ICELAB) on air samples from ice obtained at the high-accumulation site of Law Dome (East Antarctica). We are motivated by the increasing use of the records by the scientific community and by recent data-handling developments at CSIRO ICELAB. A number of cores and firn air samples have been collected at Law Dome to provide high-resolution records overlapping recent, direct atmospheric observations. The records have been updated through a dynamic link to the calibration scales used in the Global Atmospheric Sampling LABoratory (GASLAB) at CSIRO, which are periodically revised with information from the latest calibration experiments. The gas-age scales have been revised based on new ice-age scales and the information derived from a new version of the CSIRO firn diffusion model. Additionally, the records have been revised with new, rule-based selection criteria and updated corrections for biases associated with the extraction procedure and the effects of gravity and diffusion in the firn. All measurements carried out in ICELAB\u2013GASLAB over the last \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 66, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12072385768778027592", "cites_id": ["12072385768778027592"], "pub_url": "https://apo.ansto.gov.au/dspace/handle/10238/13256", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SNJ---S6iacJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 12, "2021": 14, "2022": 22, "2023": 10}}
