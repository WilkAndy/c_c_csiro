They have very high air age resolution, data density and measurement precision. Firn air measurements span the past 65 years and overlap with the ice core and direct atmospheric observations. Major increases in CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations during the past 200 years followed a period of relative stability beforehand. Decadal variations during the industrial period include the stabilization of CO2 and slowing of CH4 and N2O growth in the 1940s and 1950s. Variations of up to 10 ppm CO2, 40 ppb CH4 and 10 ppb N2O occurred throughout the preindustrial period. Methane concentrations grew by 100 ppb from AD 0 to 1800, possibly due to early anthropogenic emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 788, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16579175411524197993", "cites_id": ["16579175411524197993"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2006GL026152", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aV7KUDIQFeYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 14, "2008": 22, "2009": 22, "2010": 37, "2011": 51, "2012": 29, "2013": 48, "2014": 41, "2015": 38, "2016": 61, "2017": 57, "2018": 68, "2019": 69, "2020": 55, "2021": 62, "2022": 65, "2023": 18}}
