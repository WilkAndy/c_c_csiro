The intercomparison included analyses of standard reference gases and samples of ice from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) site. Concentrations of CO2, CH4, the \u03b4;18O of O2, the \u03b415N of N2, and the O2/N2, and Ar/N2 ratios were measured in air standards and ice core samples. The standard reference scales for CO2 and CH4 were consistent at the \u00b12% level. The \u03b4O2/N2 and \u03b418O of O2 measurements showed substantial deviations between the two laboratories able to measure these ratios. The deviations are probably related to errors associated with calibration of the working standards. The \u03b4ArN2 and \u03b415N of N2 measurements were consistent. Five laboratories analyzed the CH4 concentration in a 4.2\u2010m section of the GISP2 ice core. The average of 20 discrete CH4 measurements \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11511152863301983266", "cites_id": ["11511152863301983266"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97JC00633", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ItxVXIrUv58J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 4, "1998": 1, "1999": 3, "2000": 4, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 3, "2004": 5, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
