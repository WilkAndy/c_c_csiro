The analysis is performed relative to two reference cases. The first case is defined by a CO2 concentration profile leading to stabilisation at 500ppm. The second case is defined by \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 (IS92a) CO2 emissions until 2100. The benefits are considered in terms of incremental change (per unit of displaced emission) in temperature and its rate of change, concentrating on the period to 2200. An automatic differentiation procedure has proved a convenient way of performing the calculations. The \u2018temperature benefit\u2019 of avoided carbon emission is found to be of order 1mK/GtC on the time-scale of decades to centuries. This result is model-specific and would scale in proportion to the climate sensitivity of the model.
