These compounds were measured in polar firn air samples, in ambient air archived in canisters, and in situ at the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network and affiliated sites. Global emissions to the atmosphere are derived from these observations using an inversion based on a 12-box atmospheric transport model. For CFC-13, we provide the first comprehensive global analysis. This compound increased monotonically from its first appearance in the atmosphere in the late 1950s to a mean global abundance of 3.18\u202fppt (dry-air mole fraction in parts per trillion, pmol\u2006mol\u22121) in 2016. Its growth rate has decreased since the mid-1980s but has remained at a surprisingly high mean level of 0.02\u202fppt\u2006yr\u22121 since 2000, resulting in a continuing growth of CFC-13 in the atmosphere. \u03a3CFC-114 increased from its appearance in the 1950s to a maximum of 16.6\u202fppt in the early 2000s and has since slightly declined to 16.3\u202fppt in 2016. CFC-115 increased monotonically from its first appearance in the 1960s and reached a global mean mole fraction of 8.49\u202fppt in 2016. Growth rates of all three compounds over the past years are significantly larger than would be expected from zero emissions. Under the assumption of unchanging lifetimes and atmospheric transport patterns, we derive global emissions from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16777276212852992959", "cites_id": ["16777276212852992959"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/979/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v6u2ZdPb1OgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 8, "2020": 8, "2021": 10, "2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
