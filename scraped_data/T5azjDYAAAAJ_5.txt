The record is unified by using the same measurement procedure and calibration scale for all samples and by ensuring high age resolution and accuracy of the ice core and firn air. In this way, methane mixing ratios, growth rates, and interpolar differences are accurately determined. From 1000 to 1800 A.D. the global mean methane mixing ratio averaged 695 ppb and varied about 40 ppb, contemporaneous with climatic variations. Interpolar (N\u2010S) differences varied between 24 and 58 ppb. The industrial period is marked by high methane growth rates from 1945 to 1990, peaking at about 17 ppb yr\u22121 in 1981 and decreasing significantly since. We calculate an average total methane source of 250 Tg yr\u22121 for 1000\u20131800 A \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 733, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15225052941962707838", "cites_id": ["15225052941962707838"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JD00923", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fgM0JPxAStMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 6, "1999": 12, "2000": 27, "2001": 21, "2002": 34, "2003": 21, "2004": 35, "2005": 30, "2006": 31, "2007": 33, "2008": 28, "2009": 33, "2010": 20, "2011": 32, "2012": 36, "2013": 45, "2014": 31, "2015": 28, "2016": 30, "2017": 29, "2018": 24, "2019": 28, "2020": 29, "2021": 37, "2022": 30, "2023": 9}}
