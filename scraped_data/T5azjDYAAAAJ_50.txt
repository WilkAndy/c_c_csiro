A large pulse of atmospheric radiocarbon, generated in the atmosphere by nuclear tests, peaked in the early\u2010to\u2010mid 1960's. We measure the profile of the radiocarbon \u201cbomb spike\u201d in firn air and ice bubbles from high snow\u2010accumulation sites drilled in 1987 and 1993 on Law Dome, East Antarctica, by employing high precision AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry). Large 14C atmospheric growth rates and a high signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio lead to a direct and precise determination of the CO2 age and age\u2010spread in the ice. A least\u2010squares comparison with the atmospheric history gives a mean CO2 age of 8.9\u00b10.5 years at the bottom of the firn (where vertical gas diffusion ceases) with an age spread in the ice (full width of a moving average smoothing window) of 12.5\u00b11.5 years.
