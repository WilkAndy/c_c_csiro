These measurements are used in combination with the AGAGE 2-D atmospheric 12-box model and a Bayesian inversion methodology to determine model atmospheric mole fractions and the history of global HFC-23 emissions. The global modelled annual mole fraction of HFC-23 in the background atmosphere was 28.9\u202f\u202f0.6\u202fpmol\u202fmol at the end of 2016, representing a 28\u202f% increase from 22.6\u202f\u202f0.4\u202fpmol\u202fmol in 2009. Over the same time frame, the modelled mole fraction of HCFC-22 increased by 19\u202f% from 199\u202f\u202f2 to 237\u202f\u202f2\u202fpmol\u202fmol. However, unlike HFC-23, the annual average HCFC-22 growth rate slowed from 2009 to 2016 at an annual average rate of 0.5\u202fpmol\u202fmol\u202fyr. This slowing atmospheric growth is consistent with HCFC-22 moving from dispersive (high fractional emissions) to feedstock (low fractional emissions) uses, with HFC-23 emissions remaining as a consequence of incomplete mitigation from all HCFC-22 production.Our results demonstrate that, following a minimum in HFC-23 global emissions in 2009 of 9.6\u202f\u202f0.6, emissions increased to a maximum in 2014 of 14.5\u202f\u202f0.6\u202fGg\u202fyr \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6866807253472238793", "cites_id": ["6866807253472238793"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/4153/2018/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ydxJrNDMS18J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 5, "2019": 12, "2020": 5, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
