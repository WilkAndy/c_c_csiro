Combined with inverse methods, we found near-zero atmospheric abundances from the early 1900s to the early 1960s, after which they rose sharply, reaching 1.66\u2009ppt (parts per trillion dry-air mole fraction) in 2017. Global c-C4F8 emissions rose from near zero in the 1960s to 1.2\u00b10.1 (1\u03c3)\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in the late 1970s to late 1980s, then declined to 0.77\u00b10.03\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, followed by a rise since the early 2000s to 2.20\u00b10.05\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2017. These emissions are significantly larger than inventory-based emission estimates. Estimated emissions from eastern Asia rose from 0.36\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2010 to 0.73\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 in 2016 and 2017, 31\u2009% of global emissions, mostly from eastern China. We estimate emissions of 0.14\u2009Gg\u2009yr\u22121 from northern and central India in 2016 and find evidence for significant emissions from Russia. In contrast, recent emissions from northwestern Europe and Australia are estimated to be small (\u22641\u2009% each). We suggest that emissions from China, India, and Russia are likely related to production of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, \u201cTeflon\u201d) and other fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals that are based on the pyrolysis of hydrochlorofluorocarbon HCFC-22 (CHClF2) in which c-C4F8 is a known by-product. The semiconductor sector, where c-C4F8 is used, is estimated to be a small source, at least in South Korea \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3889470761668228919", "cites_id": ["3889470761668228919"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2019-267/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N7eA6Qwt-jUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 10, "2021": 13, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
