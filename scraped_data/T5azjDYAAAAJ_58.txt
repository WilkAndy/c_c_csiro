The firn air samples and ice cores used in this study were collected from the region of Law Dome, Antarctica. No evidence of in-situ 14CO2 was found in the firn air samples or the ice core air samples from one site although a slight enhancement of 14CO above expected polar atmospheric concentrations was observed for some firn air samples. A clear in-situ 14CO2 signal for ice pre-dating the radiocarbon bomb pulse was found, however, in air samples extracted from an ice core from a second site. We compare these results and propose an hypothesis to explain this apparent contradiction. The degree to which in-situ 14C is released from the ice crystals during trapping and bubble formation is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16047711728187654042", "cites_id": ["16047711728187654042"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X00002809", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mr9-2MrstN4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 2, "2012": 5, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
