We also include results from archived air samples in canisters and from polar firn in both hemispheres, thereby deriving an atmospheric record of nearly nine decades (1930s to present). All three halons were absent from the atmosphere until \u223c1970, when their atmospheric burdens started to increase rapidly. In recent years H\u20101211 and H\u20102402 mole fractions have been declining, but H\u20101301 has continued to grow. High\u2010frequency observations show continuing emissions of H\u20101211 and H\u20101301 near most AGAGE sites. For H\u20102402 the only emissions detected were derived from the region surrounding the Sea of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13271319803557329197", "cites_id": ["13271319803557329197"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015JD024488", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LTmk_wszLbgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 4, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
