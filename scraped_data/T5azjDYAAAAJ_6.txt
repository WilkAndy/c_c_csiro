It is a product of photochemistry, and its future abundance is controlled primarily by emissions of CH4, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). There is now greater confidence in the model assessment of the increase in tropospheric O3 since the pre-industrial period, which amounts to 30% when globally averaged, as well as the response to future emissions. For scenarios in which the CH4 abundance doubles and anthropogenic CO and NOx emissions triple, the tropospheric O3 abundance is predicted to increase by an additional 50% above today\u2019s abundance. CO is identified as an important indirect greenhouse gas. An addition of CO to the atmosphere perturbs the OH-CH4-O3 chemistry. Model calculations indicate that the emission of 100 Mt of CO stimulates an atmospheric chemistry perturbation that is equivalent to direct emission of about 5 Mt of CH4."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 497, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8044286800990571238,4783841857929020390", "cites_id": ["8044286800990571238", "4783841857929020390"], "pub_url": "https://hal.science/hal-03333922/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5gponDkMo28J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 5, "2002": 3, "2003": 13, "2004": 15, "2005": 24, "2006": 19, "2007": 28, "2008": 22, "2009": 29, "2010": 20, "2011": 26, "2012": 22, "2013": 34, "2014": 22, "2015": 36, "2016": 22, "2017": 19, "2018": 14, "2019": 21, "2020": 26, "2021": 38, "2022": 26, "2023": 9}}
