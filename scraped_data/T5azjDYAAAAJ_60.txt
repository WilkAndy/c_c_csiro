It provides a direct connection to the deep ocean carbon reservoir through biogeochemical processes that include surface primary productivity, remineralization at depth and the upwelling of carbon-rich water masses. However, the role of these different processes in modulating past and future air\u2013sea carbon flux remains poorly understood. A key period in this regard is the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR, 14.6\u201312.7\u2009kyr bp), when mid- to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling coincided with a sustained plateau in the global deglacial increase in atmospheric CO2. Here we reconstruct high-latitude Southern Ocean surface productivity from marine-derived aerosols captured in a highly resolved horizontal ice core. Our multiproxy reconstruction reveals a sustained signal of enhanced \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3809258920244247977", "cites_id": ["3809258920244247977"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-020-0587-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qX2lPs403TQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 12, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
