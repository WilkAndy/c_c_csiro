However, when comparing greenhouse emissions from different fuels it is important to include fugitive emissions released upstream of utilisation because even small losses of methane can have a significant impact due to its high global warming potential (GWP). Current estimates of these emissions are in many cases very uncertain, especially in relation to coal seam gas (CSG).Most of the methods used to estimate fugitive emissions from the gas industry are based on a comprehensive study of methane leakage from gas production, processing, transportation and distribution of conventional and unconventional natural gas in the United States during the early 1990s. The results of that study showed that fugitive emissions across the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3365829338161935584", "cites_id": ["3365829338161935584"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3365829338161935584&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4PS6O_PTtS4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 4, "2014": 8, "2015": 5, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
