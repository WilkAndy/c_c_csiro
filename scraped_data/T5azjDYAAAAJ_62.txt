A similar history is obtained from air pumped from different layers of the firn at Law Dome, Antarctica, after correction for diffusion and gravitational settling effects in the firn. The archive records are linked to measurements since 1992 using 5-L glass flasks filled at Cape Grim, and compared to data since 1989 from a comparable site at Baring Head, New Zealand. Over 18 years the delta C-13 of atmospheric methane in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere has increased by about 0.6 percent while the methane mixing ratio increased by about 200 ppb. The delta C-13 growth rate decreases over the 18-year period, but by relatively less than the simultaneous decrease in mixing ratio growth rate. The overall increase in delta C-13 is significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 28, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4753890501818819049", "cites_id": ["4753890501818819049"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4753890501818819049&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6aEDZjk2-UEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1999": 1, "2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 7, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
