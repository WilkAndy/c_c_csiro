Bore holes BHC1 (300 m deep) and BHC2 (344 m) were drilled in the coastal area to within several metres of bedrock and BHQ (418 m) was drilled about half-way towards the dome centre to about 50% of the ice thickness. Detailed measurements of orientation (inclination and azimuth), diameter, and temperature were taken through each bore hole over a 1 year span for BHC1 and BHC2 and a 10 year span for BHQ. The orientation data were reduced to obtain \u2202u/\u2202z, a measure of the shear strain-rate. Changes in the depth of features located by bore-hole diameter measurements were used to obtain vertical velocity profiles. Other measurements discussed are temperatures, oxygen isotopes, crystal structure, surface velocities, and surface and bedrock \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1000068744473927616", "cites_id": ["1000068744473927616"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-glaciology/article/dynamics-of-the-law-dome-ice-cap-antarctica-as-found-from-borehole-measurements/CCA1FAACA9B0CAB1326DFCAAE8DA0E6E", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wN9WeTn14A0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 2, "1999": 2, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 5, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
