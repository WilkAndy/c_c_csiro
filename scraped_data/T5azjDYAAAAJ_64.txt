To quantify the growth rate and its causes over the past decades, we performed a multi-site reconstruction of the atmospheric N2O mole fraction and isotopic composition using new and previously published firn air data collected from Greenland and Antarctica in combination with a firn diffusion and densification model. The multi-site reconstruction showed that while the global mean N2O mole fraction increased from (290\u202f\u00b1\u202f1)\u202fnmol\u202fmol\u22121 in 1940 to (322\u202f\u00b1\u202f1)\u202fnmol\u202fmol\u22121 in 2008, the isotopic composition of atmospheric N2O decreased by (\u22122.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2)\u202f\u2030 for \u03b415Nav, (\u22121.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3)\u202f\u2030 for \u03b418O, (\u22121.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6)\u202f\u2030 for \u03b415N\u03b1, and (\u22122.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6)\u202f\u2030 for \u03b415N\u03b2 over the same period. The detailed temporal evolution of the mole fraction and isotopic composition derived from the firn air model was then used in a two-box atmospheric model (comprising a stratospheric box and a tropospheric box) to infer changes in the isotopic source signature over time. The precise value of the source strength depends on the choice of the N2O lifetime, which we choose to fix at 123 years. The average isotopic composition over the investigated period is \u03b415Nav\u2009=\u2009\u202f(\u22127.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8)\u202f\u2030 (vs. air-N2), \u03b418O\u202f\u2009=\u2009\u202f(32.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2)\u202f\u2030 (vs. Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water \u2013 VSMOW) for \u03b418O, \u03b415N\u03b1\u2009=\u2009\u202f(\u22123.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.9)\u202f\u2030 and \u03b415N\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u202f(\u221211.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.3)\u202f\u2030. \u03b415Nav, and \u03b415N\u03b2 show some temporal variability, while for the other signatures the error bars of the reconstruction are too large to retrieve reliable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 26, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3267767673142514747", "cites_id": ["3267767673142514747"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/4539/2017/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OxQqpmJxWS0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 3, "2019": 6, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
