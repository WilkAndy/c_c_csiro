Although numerous records exist across the North Atlantic region, few Antarctic ice core records have been obtained from the south. Here we exploit the potential of upwelling ancient ice \u2013 so\u2010called blue ice areas (BIAs) \u2013 from the Patriot Hills in the Ellsworth Mountains to derive the first deuterium isotope record (\u03b4D) from continental Antarctica south of the Weddell Sea. Gas analysis and glaciological considerations provide a first relative chronology. Inferred temperature trends from the Patriot Hills BIA and snow pit suggest changing climate influences during the transition between the last glacial period and Holocene.
