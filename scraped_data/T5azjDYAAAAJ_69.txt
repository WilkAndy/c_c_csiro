Firn air transport modeling is essential for interpretation of firn gas records. Each site needs to be characterised individually through a tuning procedure, in which the effective diffusivity at each depth is adjusted to optimise the agreement between modeled and measured mixing ratios of a selected reference gas (usually CO2). We present the characterisation of the NEEM site, Northern Greenland (77.45 N 51.06 W), where an ensemble of ten reference tracers is used to constrain the diffusivity reconstruction. By analysing uncertainties in both data and the reference gas atmospheric histories, we can objectively assign weights to each of the gases used for the model tuning, and define a root mean square criterion that is minimised in the tuning. Each tracer constrains the firn profile differently through its \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5708322332480102654", "cites_id": ["5708322332480102654"], "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=16807367&asa=Y&AN=66845092&h=au7Dw9jT7xD2sJ4sW8B562ppurtT34e3eWU8awkBHrtSWlll8UI5xxn5oIpbJkaJfrBsFnrLKxanN4V8HX%2FURg%3D%3D&crl=c", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_uDn2uoIOE8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 8, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
