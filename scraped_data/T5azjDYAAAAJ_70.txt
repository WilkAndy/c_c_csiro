The anthropogenic CO2 perturbation sits on top of the natural variability of the carbon cycle that occurs on a range of timescales. To understand CO2 variations over the past 1000 years, we need to consider exchanges between the atmosphere, the oceans and the terrestrial biosphere, and, in recent centuries, the anthropogenic source of CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels. Climate is the most important driver of natural variations in exchange between the reservoirs. In the oceans, temperature and wind-speed influence CO2 solubility, air-sea gas exchange rates, biological activity, and ocean circulation, all of which influence CO2 fluxes. Temperature and precipitation influence photosynthesis and respiration for the terrestrial biosphere. The anthropogenic CO2 perturbation is due to fossil fuel burning \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14063358766733287150", "cites_id": ["14063358766733287150"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-27048-5_15", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7l4DmEkWK8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
