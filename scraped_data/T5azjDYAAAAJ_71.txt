In their Review (\u201cThe impact of climate change on the world\u2019s marine ecosystems,\u201d 18 June, p. 1523), O. Hoegh-Guldberg and JF Bruno redress this gap by synthesizing recent literature. In so doing, they made the disparities in research among ocean systems apparent. Specifically, there are no studies of climate change impacts to sandy beach ecosystems. Rather than any oversight by Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno or previous authors (3), we believe that the omission of beaches from this and other assessments of anthropogenic impacts reflects a relative lack of appreciation of beaches as ecosystems. This paucity of beach studies (4, 5) is alarming, not only because beaches comprise~ 70% of open-ocean coasts and have high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17861745712997693894", "cites_id": ["17861745712997693894"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.329.5996.1146-b", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xnmVIxer4fcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
