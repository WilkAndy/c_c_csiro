The brief was for GNS Science, with major partners the University of Auckland and CRL Energy, to conduct a range of initial assessments of the feasibility of subsurface storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in both the Waikato and onshore Taranaki regions. The overall aim of the research is to help major CO2 emitters and the government develop policy and implement mitigation strategies, paving the way for pilot-scale projects to capture CO2 and store it underground in geological formations. The output reports are listed in Table 1.1, crossreferenced to specific programme tasks outlined in the FRST contract (C05X0707)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14483899151518159435", "cites_id": ["14483899151518159435"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14483899151518159435&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S1LSEIolAckJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 9, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
