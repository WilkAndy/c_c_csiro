The Otway Basin with its natural CO2 accumulations and many depleted gas fields, offers an appropriate site for such a pilot project. The goal of this pilot project is to demonstrate that CO2 can be safely transported and stored underground. The constraints of risk assessment and established regulatory performance criteria over the different phases of the project, provide a framework within which a range of established direct and remote sensing technologies are deployed. These provide repeat assessments from a reservoir, containment, wellbore integrity, near surface and atmospheric perspective. The measurements involve seismic, microseismic, petrophysical well logs and geochemical sampling including tracer and isotope analysis, plus associated forward modelling. The areal consequences of CO2 migration and trapping will be addressed through characterization of the hydrodynamic properties of the region. A network of soil sampling and atmospheric detectors is planned to provide a baseline against which anomalous sources of CO2 can be distinguished from the storage reservoir CO2 to the satisfaction of the community and regulatory authorities."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15371036066894149324", "cites_id": ["15371036066894149324"], "pub_url": "http://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/internal/etheridgedm_x2006e.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zHbxFN3jUNUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 2, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1}}
