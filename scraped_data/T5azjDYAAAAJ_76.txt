CSIRO, Collingwood, Australia, 1996", "author": "MR Manning and GI Pearman and DM Etheridge and PJ Fraser and DC Lowe and LP Steele", "abstract": "This paper reviews changes that have occurred in the atmospheric levels of major greenhouse gases and consequent changes to heating of the lower atmosphere through the enhanced greenhouse effect. The naturally occurring greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased by about 27%, 140% and 10%, respectively, over the last 300 years and over the last decade have increased at an average rate of 0.4, 0.7 and 0.3% y (-1), respectively The vapid increases in these gases that occurred after the 18th century have been due to changes in anthropogenic sources and sinks. Direct measurements in the atmosphere, and studies of source and sink processes, are now producing detailed budgets for these gases."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4257485821708264448", "cites_id": ["4257485821708264448"], "pub_url": "https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/1715985", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AOQuN8ygFTsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 4, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1}}
