Gas production is set to increase significantly over the coming years as several liquefied natural gas facilities under construction near Gladstone come on line. To assess the greenhouse impact of the CSG industry, it is important to understand the level of fugitive emissions of CH4 from gas production and processing. However, it is also necessary to account for other sources of methane (CH4) contributing to overall regional emissions. The Surat Basin, like many other sedimentary basins, is known for seeps of CH4 and other hydrocarbons and these along with other sources such as agriculture, must be determined before a proper assessment of CSG related emissions can be made. Methane emissions from these seeps are very small and pose no health concern to humans but measuring their concentration is important for locating sources and hence emission rates of methane from these seeps into the atmosphere.At present there is relatively little quantitative CH4 emission data for the Surat Basin. Hence the purpose of the project reported here, which was undertaken as part of the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Alliance (GISERA), was to develop appropriate methodology to characterise CH4 emissions within the Surat Basin and to commence a programme to establish background CH4 concentrations and emission rates (fluxes) and their changes over time in the region. In this report, we present the results of the pilot study aimed at developing and refining the different methods for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15972952848041892859", "cites_id": ["15972952848041892859"], "pub_url": "https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GHG-1-Phase-2-Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-9uZqfxTq90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
