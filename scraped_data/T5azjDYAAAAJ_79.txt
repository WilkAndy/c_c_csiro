While the mixing ratio measurements compare favorably to other firn air studies, the isotope results show extreme 13C depletion at the deepest measurable depth (65 m), to values lower than \u03b413C = \u221280\u2030 vs. VPDB (the international stable carbon isotope scale), compared to present day surface tropospheric measurements near \u221240\u2030. Firn air modeling was used to interpret these measurements. Reconstructed atmospheric time series indicate even larger depletions (to \u2212120\u2030) near 1950 AD, with subsequent rapid enrichment of the atmospheric reservoir of the compound to the present day value. Mass-balance calculations show that this change is likely to have been caused by a large change in the isotopic composition of anthropogenic CFC-12 emissions, probably due to technological advances in the CFC production process over the last 80 yr, though direct evidence is lacking."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8179808913410849300", "cites_id": ["8179808913410849300"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/599/2013/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FHptRt6EhHEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
