The core, called DE08, contains air from as recent as 1978 with an age resolution (80% air\u2010age distribution width) of about 14\u2003years. It was drilled from a region of Law Dome, Antarctica with extremely high snow\u2010accumulation rate (1160\u2003kg m\u22122 yr\u22121). The ice chronology was determined from the observed chemical and isotopic seasonal variations, verified against a volcanic horizon. The calculated air\u2010age includes the effects of bubble close\u2010off, sealing of the firn and diffusive mixing of air in the firn. The mean air\u2010age was 35\u2003years younger than the host ice except for air in summer ice layers which was 37\u2003years younger than the host ice. The extracted ice\u2010core air was analysed for methane using gas chromatography with \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 303, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10295810351454421715", "cites_id": ["10295810351454421715"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0889.1992.t01-3-00006.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0wI7EfcQ4o4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 3, "1993": 11, "1994": 10, "1995": 9, "1996": 18, "1997": 21, "1998": 20, "1999": 12, "2000": 17, "2001": 5, "2002": 18, "2003": 9, "2004": 5, "2005": 12, "2006": 9, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 7, "2011": 6, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 8, "2015": 4, "2016": 8, "2017": 10, "2018": 7, "2019": 10, "2020": 6, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
