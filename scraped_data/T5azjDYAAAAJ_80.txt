Due to the different time scales for snow accumulation versus diffusion of gases through the snowpack, age differences between gases and the ice in which 5 they are \u201ctrapped\u201d can be large; eg several thousand years in central Antarctica (a low snow accumulation area). Models of trace gas diffusion in polar firn are used to relate firn air and ice core records of trace gases to their atmospheric history. We propose a new diffusion model based on the following contributions. First, the airflow transport model is revised in a poromechanics framework with specific emphasis on the 10 non-homogeneous properties (convective layer, depth-dependent diffusivity and lockin zone) and an almost-stagnant behavior described by Darcy\u2019s law (gravity effect). We then derive a non-linear least square multi-gas optimization scheme to calculate the effective firn diffusivity (automatic diffusivity tuning). The improvements associated with the additional constraints gained by the multi-gas approach are investigated (up to 15 eleven gases for a single site are included in the optimization process). The model is applied to measured data from four Arctic (Devon Island, NEEM, North GRIP, Summit) and seven Antarctic (DE08, Berkner Island, Siple Dome, Dronning Maud Land, South Pole, Dome C, Vostok) sites and the depth-dependent diffusivity profiles are calculated. Among these different sites, a relationship between an increasing thickness of the lock-20 in zone defined from the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7458650825269838220", "cites_id": ["7458650825269838220"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William-Sturges/publication/258456680_A_new_multi-gas_constrained_model_of_trace_gas_non-homogeneous_transport_in_firn_Evaluation_and_behavior_at_eleven_polar_sites/links/54578c3e0cf2cf51648198d5/A-new-multi-gas-constrained-model-of-trace-gas-non-homogeneous-transport-in-firn-Evaluation-and-behavior-at-eleven-polar-sites.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jAHib2hzgmcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 6, "2013": 5}}
