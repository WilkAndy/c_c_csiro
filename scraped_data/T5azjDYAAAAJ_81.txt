The subglacial topography based on data from the BEDMAP2 and ICECAP projects, together with subsurface transects of the ice margin obtained using ground-penetrating radar, reveal several lakes and lake-like depressions and the drainage pathways of two j\u00f6kulhlaup events. Oxygen isotope typing of the meltwater during the most recent (2014) j\u00f6kulhlaup event, combined with ice margin stratigraphy, enable the identification of ice tunnel melt pathways that exploit the 30\u201390\u00b0 dipping basal ice layering. The presence of subglacial meltwater beneath Law Dome during the Holocene to Glacial periods is confirmed by the dendritic drainage pattern in the subglacial morphology and extensive \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16096953149527132873", "cites_id": ["16096953149527132873"], "pub_url": "https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/abs/10.1144/SP461.16", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yYqrq5rdY98J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 4}}
