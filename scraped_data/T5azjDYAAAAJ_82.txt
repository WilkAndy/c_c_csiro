The Earth system sensitivity (ESS) describes the multi-millennial response of Earth (in terms of the change in global-mean temperature) to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. A recent study 2 used a correlation of inferred temperatures and radiative forcing from greenhouse gases over the past 800,000 years 3 to estimate that the ESS from present-day CO2 concentrations is about 9 C and to imply a long-term commitment of 3\u20137 C even if greenhouse gas concentrations remain at present-day levels. However, we demonstrate that the methodology of ref. 2 does not reliably estimate the ESS in the presence of orbital forcing of ice-age cycles and therefore conclude that the inferred 2 present-day committed warming is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2569777792013468386", "cites_id": ["2569777792013468386"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22803", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4oKmXEmvqSMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
