Methane emissions across Queensland's Surat Basin, Australia, result from a mix of activities, including the production and processing of coal seam gas (CSG). We measured methane concentrations over 1.5 years from two monitoring stations established 80\u2009km apart on either side of the main CSG belt located within a study area of 350\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u2009350\u2009km. Using an inverse modelling approach coupled with a bottom-up inventory, we quantify methane emissions from this area. The inventory suggests that the total emission is 173.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009kg\u2009CH4\u2009yr\u22121, with grazing cattle contributing about half of that, cattle feedlots \u223c\u200925\u2009%, and CSG processing \u223c\u20098\u2009%. Using the inventory emissions in a forward regional transport model indicates that the above sources are significant contributors to methane at both monitors. However, the model underestimates approximately the highest 15\u2009% of the observed methane concentrations, suggesting underestimated or missing emissions. An efficient regional Bayesian inverse model is developed, incorporating an hourly source\u2013receptor relationship based on a backward-in-time configuration of the forward regional transport model, a posterior sampling scheme, and the hourly methane observations and a derived methane background. The inferred emissions obtained from one of the inverse model setups that uses a Gaussian prior whose averages are identical to the gridded bottom-up inventory emissions across the domain with an uncertainty of 3\u2009% of the averages \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3731155066929715126", "cites_id": ["3731155066929715126"], "pub_url": "https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-337/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tpc-zsO5xzMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
