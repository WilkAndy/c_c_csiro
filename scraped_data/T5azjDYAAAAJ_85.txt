The study uses high precision CO2 measurements from the Arcturus atmospheric monitoring station in the Bowen Basin, Australia. A statistical model of the observed CO2 signal was constructed, combining both a regression and a time series model. A non-parametric goodness of fit approach using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test was then used to test whether simulated perturbations can be detected against the modelled expected value of the background for certain hours of the day and for particular seasons.The KS test calculates the probability that the modelled leak perturbation could be caused by natural variation in the background.
