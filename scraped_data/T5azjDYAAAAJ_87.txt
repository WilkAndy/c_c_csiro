Those elevated greenhouse gas concentrations warm the planet and together with 26 net cooling effects by aerosols, they are the reason of observed climate change over the past 150 years. An accurate 27 representation of those concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent and future climate change. So far, 28 community efforts to create composite datasets with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary 29 layer conditions and recent trends since 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated data sets of historical atmospheric (volume) 30 mixing ratios of 43 greenhouse gases specifically for the purpose of climate model runs.
