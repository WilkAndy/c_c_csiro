The station was part of a collaborative project between Geoscience Australia (GA) and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR) to establish and operate a high precision atmospheric monitoring facility for measurement of baseline greenhouse gases in a geological carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) region. The primary purpose of the station was to establish newly developed greenhouse gas monitoring technology and demonstrate best practice for regional baseline atmospheric monitoring appropriate for geological storage of carbon dioxide. The GHG records were to be used as a reference for monitoring of the atmosphere at a CO2 storage project (see for example Leuning et al., 2008 and Etheridge et al., 2011), providing a baseline to quantify typical variations in the area and a background against which any anomalies in the immediate vicinity of the storage might be detected.Site selection was based on the recommendations of the Carbon Storage Taskforce\u2019s National Carbon Mapping and Infrastructure Plan, regional assessments of prospective basins, regional atmospheric modelling, and consultation with key stakeholders (Berko et al., 2012). During early 2010, the ZeroGen CCS project had an active exploration program for geological storage and the atmospheric station was therefore eventually located approximately 8 km upwind from the boundary of ZeroGen\u2019s most prospective storage area in the northern Denison Trough, part of the larger Bowen Basin."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1572160343414461688", "cites_id": ["1572160343414461688"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Feitz/publication/263673158_Metadata_report_Arcturus_atmospheric_greenhouse_gas_monitoring/links/0deec53ba6cbadf486000000/Metadata-report-Arcturus-atmospheric-greenhouse-gas-monitoring.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-NQsr4Bv0RUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
