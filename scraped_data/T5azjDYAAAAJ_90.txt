Natural connectivity between coal seams and coal bearing aquifers and the atmosphere results the seepage of \u2018background\u2019emissions of methane to the atmosphere. This project addresses the location and quantity of background methane emissions in the Surat Basin, Queensland, Australia. In particular, this report presents results of Phase 1 of the project \u2018Characterising the regional fluxes of methane seepage in the Surat Basin, Queensland\u2019undertaken as part of the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA) between APLNG and CSIRO. Phase 1 of the project is a \u2018Survey, Review and Analysis of Literature\u2019with the aim of tailoring a set of methods to the specific problem of locating and quantifying methane seeps. The testing of these methods is the aim of the Pilot Phase (Phase 2)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10219665601834100610", "cites_id": ["10219665601834100610"], "pub_url": "https://gisera.csiro.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GHG-1-Literature-review.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gqeZALiL040J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
