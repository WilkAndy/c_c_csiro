Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, US Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., USA", "abstract": "MethodsThe Antarctic CH 4 records presented here are derived from three ice cores obtained at Law Dome, East Antarctica (66 44'S, 112 50'E, 1390 meters above mean sea level). Law Dome has many qualities of an ideal ice core site for the reconstruction of past concentrations of atmospheric gases; these qualities include: negligible melting of the ice sheet surface, low concentrations of impurities, regular stratigraphic layering undisturbed by wind stress at the surface or differential ice flow at depth, and a high snow accumulation rate. Further details on the site, drilling, and cores are provided by Etheridge et al.(1998), Etheridge et al.(1996), Etheridge and Wookey (1989), and Morgan et al.(1997)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18107928555980293031", "cites_id": ["18107928555980293031"], "pub_url": "https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/atm_meth/lawdome_meth", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:p4Nb7RRJTPsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
