However, the measurements are both analytically challenging and time-consuming; thus only data exist from a limited number of sampling sites and time periods. Additional analytical resources with high analytical precision and throughput are thus desirable to extend the existing datasets. Moreover, consistent measurements derived by independent laboratories and a variety of analytical systems help to further increase confidence in the global CO2 palaeo-reconstructions. Here, we describe our new set-up for simultaneous measurements of atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios and atmospheric \u03b413C and \u03b418O-CO2 in air extracted from ice core samples. The centrepiece of the system is a newly designed needle cracker for the mechanical release of air entrapped in ice core samples of 8\u201313\u202fg operated at \u221245\u202f\u00b0C. The small sample size allows for high resolution and replicate sampling schemes. In our method, CO2 is cryogenically and chromatographically separated from the bulk air and its isotopic composition subsequently determined by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). In combination with thermal conductivity measurement of the bulk air, the CO2 mixing ratio is calculated. The analytical precision determined from standard air sample measurements over ice is \u00b11.9\u202fppm for CO2 and \u00b10.09\u202f\u2030 for \u03b413C. In a laboratory intercomparison study with CSIRO (Aspendale, Australia), good agreement between CO2 and \u03b413C results \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7196718939027480832,10295593969537528297", "cites_id": ["7196718939027480832", "10295593969537528297"], "pub_url": "https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/9/3687/2016/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ACEPxb7h32MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
