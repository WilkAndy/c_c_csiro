PFCs remain in the atmosphere for 1000s of years and are targeted for controls in global and Australian strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Global production of primary aluminium, likely to exceed 40 million tonnes in 2008, is growing at 9% per year (2004-2007), driven by the huge demand/production in China (13 million tonnes, 2007; Figure 1), currently (2004-2007) growing at about 25% per year (IAI, 2008; ABARE, 2008). Australian aluminium production, close to 2 million tonnes in 2007 (5% of global production), is growing at about 2% per year (AAC, 2008; ABARE, 2008)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10454110369151119499", "cites_id": ["10454110369151119499"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10454110369151119499&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:i_D6E_51FJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
