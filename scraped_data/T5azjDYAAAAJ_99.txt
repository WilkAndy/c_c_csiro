This new method overcomes problems with other methods for correlation with non-uniform sampling and is an easy modification to existing correlation based codes. To demonstrate the usefulness of this new method to real-world examples, we apply the method with good success to two glaciological examples to map the ages from a well-dated ice core to a nearby core, and by tracing isochronous layers within the ice sheet measured from ice-penetrating radar between the two ice core sites."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "T5azjDYAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15988727415769858681", "cites_id": ["15988727415769858681"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-020-74532-9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eQKDa99e490J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 1}}
