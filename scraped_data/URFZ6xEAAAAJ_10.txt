We tested and applied a 32\u2010multi\u2010model ensemble to simulate global wheat yield and quality in a changing climate. Potential benefits of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration by 2050 on global wheat grain and protein yield are likely to be negated by impacts from rising temperature and changes in rainfall, but with considerable disparities between regions. Grain and protein yields are expected to be lower and more variable in most low\u2010rainfall regions, with nitrogen availability limiting growth stimulus from elevated CO2. Introducing genotypes adapted to warmer temperatures (and also considering changes in CO2 and rainfall) could boost global wheat yield by 7% and protein yield by 2%, but grain protein concentration would be reduced by \u22121.1 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC", "num_citations": 332, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9764574857456613190", "cites_id": ["9764574857456613190"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14481", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RndpERm9gocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 20, "2020": 72, "2021": 82, "2022": 102, "2023": 47}}
