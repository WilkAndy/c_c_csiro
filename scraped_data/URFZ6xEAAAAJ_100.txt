This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data. Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols. Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can interpolate between temperature levels and between CO2 concentration levels \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14182438426185707452", "cites_id": ["14182438426185707452"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192315007194", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vC-mWZsk0sQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 8, "2018": 8, "2019": 10, "2020": 4, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
