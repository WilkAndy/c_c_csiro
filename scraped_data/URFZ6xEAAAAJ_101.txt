High quality, site\u2010specific data on weather, soils, management, and cultivar are needed for those model applications. Also important is that model development, evaluation, improvement, and calibration require additional high quality, site\u2010specific measurements on crop yield, growth, phenology, and ancillary traits. We review the evolution of minimum data set requirements for agroecosystem modeling and then describe the characteristics and ranking of sentinel site data needed for crop model improvement, calibration, and application. We in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), propose to rank sentinel site data sets as platinum, gold, silver, and copper, based on the degree of true site\u2010specific measurement of weather, soils, management, crop yield, as well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:fbc8zXXH2BUC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3263649152098048699", "cites_id": ["3263649152098048699"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/advagricsystmodel7.2014.0019", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uxpPvpzPSi0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 8, "2022": 7, "2023": 1}}
