The burnt and GCTB systems were compared in 5 field experiments in Australia at 3 locations with different climates. Soil and trash were sampled eight to 10 times over one (12-month) season in each experiment. At the time of this study, the experiments had been running for between one and six years. Under GCTB, trash containing 7-12 t dry matter/ha, 3000-5000 kg C/ha, and 30-60 kg N/ha was deposited on the soil surface at harvest. Most of the dry matter (> 85%) was decomposed during the subsequent 12 months. In the oldest experiments, 3-6 years of GCTB increased total N, organic C and microbial biomass C in the soil. These changes were largely restricted to the upper 20 or 50 mm. In the youngest experiments, 1-2 years of GCTB had no effect on total or microbial C and N levels. Short-term laboratory incubations of soil showed that microbial respiration was greater under GCTB, particularly in the older experiments. Concomitant net mineralization of N, however, generally did not differ significantly between trash management treatments. The ratio (C mineralization: N mineralization) indicated greater immobilization of N in GCTB than in burnt soils. The effect of GCTB on soil properties increased with increasing cumulative returns of C and N. Approximately 10-20% of cumulative C returns were measured as soil organic C and 40-100% of cumulative N returns measured as total soil N. Measured rates of decomposition and accumulation of C and N were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2543642992193899523", "cites_id": ["2543642992193899523"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001912601", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AwwhGdPVTCMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 10, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
