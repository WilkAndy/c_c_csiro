The 2H and 18O concentrations of water sampled from trees were significantly different from those of the creek water, indicating that, generally, trees were not obtaining all their water from the creek. This was found even in trees overlying highly saline groundwater. Thus, saline groundwater and/or soil water were important water sources for the trees studied. The results indicated that the water relations of these trees are complex, and the trees may be less affected by changes in creek flow and/or salinity than was previously anticipated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4438166572196464270", "cites_id": ["4438166572196464270"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf9941439", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jobIpfuIlz0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 3, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 2, "2003": 0, "2004": 2, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
