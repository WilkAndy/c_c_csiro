There are many methods for measuring the amount of water being used by plants, but until recently it has been difficult to determine from where plants obtained their water. This has been particularly difficult where there is more than one available water source (e.g. where groundwater is shallow or streams are nearby)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14844597184785391720", "cites_id": ["14844597184785391720"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-015-9841-5_4", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aKDlUH2aAs4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 4, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 7, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 2, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
