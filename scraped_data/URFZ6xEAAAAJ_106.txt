Water tables will continue to rise over the coming decades (and in some cases centuries) because of the practical limits to reducing recharge in affected catchments, and the time lag between recharge and discharge in the landscape. Thus, land management techniques must be identified to minimise the detrimental impacts of this process. It has generally been assumed that plants overlying shallow water tables take up and transpire more groundwater than would have been evaporated if soils were bare. However, a collation of results from 20 field studies shows that trees, shrubs and crops rarely transpire more than 500 mm yr -1 of saline (electrical conductivity > 5 dS m-1) groundwater. These rates were generally similar to potential groundwater evaporation rates from bare soils with water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4987477616052452314", "cites_id": ["4987477616052452314"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-6141-5_2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2rsEjncUN0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 3, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1}}
