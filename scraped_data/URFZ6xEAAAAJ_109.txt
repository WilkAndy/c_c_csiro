Effects of three physical dispersion and two fine-fraction determination methods on PSA results were investigated over a wide range of soil textures to find the most appropriate technique for routine PSA. Interactions between physical dispersion and fine-fraction determination methods were also investigated. The reciprocating shaker produced significantly lower silt and fine sand and higher coarse sand (and clay, although not significant) values than either drink mixer or end-over-end shaker dispersions. This result was interpreted as the reciprocating shaker giving the most effective dispersion, with aggregated clay being dispersed to primary particles while coarse sand was not fragmented to fine sand or silt.
