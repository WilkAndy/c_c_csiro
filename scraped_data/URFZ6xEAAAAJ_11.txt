The trees investigated ranged in distance from 0.5 to 40 m from a stream, with electrical conductivity 0.8 dSm\u22121, and grew over groundwater with electrical conductivity ranging from 30 to 50 dSm\u22121. The sources of water being used by the trees were investigated using the naturally occurring stable isotopes of water and measurements of soil water potential. Xylem water potential and leaf conductance were also examined to identify the trees' response to using these sources of water. Trees at distances greater than about 15 m from the stream used no stream water. The trees used groundwater in summer and a combination of groundwater and rain-derived surface-soil water (0.05\u20130.15 m depth) in winter. In doing so they suffered water stress at electrical conductivities higher than \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC", "num_citations": 260, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=63590804268815606", "cites_id": ["63590804268815606"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317126", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9pRs43_r4QAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 5, "1996": 8, "1997": 8, "1998": 4, "1999": 3, "2000": 5, "2001": 4, "2002": 6, "2003": 7, "2004": 7, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 7, "2009": 17, "2010": 10, "2011": 13, "2012": 9, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 18, "2016": 14, "2017": 9, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 17, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 3}}
