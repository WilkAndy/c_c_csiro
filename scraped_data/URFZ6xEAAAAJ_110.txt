Here we consider calibration of the phenology sub-model of the widely used crop model APSIM-Oryza, using commonly available varietal data. We show that the dynamic phenology sub-model can be well approximated by a static model, with three equations. It is then straightforward to estimate the parameters using any standard statistical software package. The approach is applied to four rice varieties from Sri Lanka. The software provides not only the best-fit parameters, but also uncertainty information about those parameters. This is essential for understanding how well the model will predict out of sample. Here the photoperiod sensitivity coefficient has large uncertainty, and so predictions for day lengths outside the data set are very unreliable. The uncertainty information is also used to show that in our case, doing more \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15935060691445244307", "cites_id": ["15935060691445244307"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215001164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k2Hic0W1JN0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 3}}
