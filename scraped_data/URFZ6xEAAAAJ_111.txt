Recently, increasingly crops are being harvested green with trash retailed as blanket (GCTB) due to environmental restrictions, and because of the trash use as a feedstock for bioenergy. The presence of a trash blanket affects sugarcane crops, by conservation of soil moisture and a potential to increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To gain insights into the impacts of the burnt-to-green cane trash blanket transition, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugar crop model. Simulations were conducted over 100 years for 3 locations: Piracicaba-SP, Palmas-TO, and Macei\u00f3-AL, addressing 2 research questions: (1) what is the yield impact of the transition from burnt to GCTB due to soil N, C and water changes; and (2) what is the impact of trash removal on yield in fields managed under GCTBs. Both questions were answered based on the same set of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11415088950502563139", "cites_id": ["11415088950502563139"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12355-013-0265-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qx0xtuuKap4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 7, "2018": 4, "2019": 6, "2020": 3, "2021": 2, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
