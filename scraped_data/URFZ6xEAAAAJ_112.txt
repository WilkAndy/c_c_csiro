The amount of mineral N in soil is the net result of complex processes in the field, so the objective of this experiment was to investigate nitrification and ammonification in these soils under laboratory conditions. Aerobic and saturated incubations were performed for 1 week on 2 wet tropical soils. Net NO3\u2212-N increased significantly in both soils during both types of incubation. A second series of aerobic incubations of these soils treated with NH4+-N and inoculated with subtropical nitrifying soils was conducted for 48 days. Nitrification in the wet tropical soils was not significantly affected by inoculation, and virtually all added N was nitrified during the incubation period. Mineral N behaviour of the 48-day incubations was captured with the APSIM-SoilN model.
