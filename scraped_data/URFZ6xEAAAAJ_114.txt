At the oldest site, Abergowrie in the Herbert River Valley, a cropping systems model was also used to examine likely longer-term (35 year) changes in total N and C and impacts on sustainable production. Differences in total N and C were confined to the surface 2 or 5 cm, with N and C being higher for GCTB in all but the youngest site. However, there was no relationship between the magnitude of the difference and the period over which the treatments had been imposed. There were no consistent treatment differences in mineral N at any depth and no significant differences in potential N mineralization. Trends in simulated total soil C (0-20 cm) and cane yields agreed well with measurements previously made at the Abergowrie site over 15 years (two crop cycles). In the 35 year simulations, total soil C increased continually in the GCTB treatment and decreased slightly to an equilibrium value in the burnt treatment. The simulations suggest that there would be no adverse production or environmental consequences of maintaining'conventional'N management for several decades after the initiation of trash blanketing at this site. The study illustrates the complexity of the impacts of trash management on soil N and C. Responses to trash blanketing will be the product of soil and climate interactions, and systems modelling will be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17801450483038817666,5647705195707759386", "cites_id": ["17801450483038817666", "5647705195707759386"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001912600", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gg088OV0C_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 5, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 2}}
