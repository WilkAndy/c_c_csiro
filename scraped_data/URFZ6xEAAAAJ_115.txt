In our view, mathematical modeling will be required to provide scientific guidance to meet this challenge. In order to be useful in GHG mitigation policy measures, models must simultaneously meet scientific, software engineering, and human capacity requirements. They can be used to understand GHG fluxes, to evaluate proposed GHG mitigation actions, and to predict and monitor the effects of specific actions; the latter applications require a change in mindset that has parallels with the shift from research modeling to decision support. We compare and contrast 6 agro\u2010ecosystem models (FullCAM, DayCent, DNDC, APSIM, WNMM, and AgMod), chosen because they are used in Australian agriculture and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4815991053133789550", "cites_id": ["4815991053133789550"], "pub_url": "https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcc.304", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:brl_u1jW1UIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 4, "2018": 6, "2019": 4, "2020": 5, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 3}}
