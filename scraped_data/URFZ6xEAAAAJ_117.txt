In Australia, marketing plans tend to be initialised in December, approximately 7 months prior to commencement of the next harvest. Improved knowledge about crop size at such an early lead time allows marketers to develop and implement a more advanced marketing plan earlier in the season. Producing accurate crop size forecasts at such an early lead time is an on-going challenge for industry. Rather than trying to predict the exact size of the crop, a Bayesian discriminant analysis procedure was applied to determine the likelihood of a small, medium, or large crop across 4 major sugarcane-growing regions in Australia: Ingham, Ayr, Mackay, and Bundaberg. The Bayesian model considers simulated potential yields, climate forecasting indices, and the size of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5633166232462400609", "cites_id": ["5633166232462400609"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/ar05443", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YZylttcGLU4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
