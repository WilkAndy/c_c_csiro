The availability of N in trash is complicated because most of the N cycles through the soil organic matter. To gain insights into the long-term fate of N contained in trash, N dynamics in the SASEX long-term trash management experiment (BT1) were simulated with the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model. Initially, the model was verified against cane yields and soil organic carbon data from the experiment. Then, simulations were conducted over 60 yr (1940 to 2000) with N fertiliser application rates ranging from 20 to 260 kg/ha. Cane yields and soil organic carbon results from the BT1 experiment were well represented by the model. The N response simulations showed that cane production not only responds positively to trash retention at the BT1 site, but that the response is dependent on the amount of N fertiliser applied to the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 29, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5035616835119246095", "cites_id": ["5035616835119246095"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Thorburn/publication/267303823_The_impact_of_trash_management_on_soil_carbon_and_nitrogen_I_modelling_long-term_experimental_results_in_the_South_African_sugar_industry/links/54b5c5ab0cf2318f0f9a044b/The-impact-of-trash-management-on-soil-carbon-and-nitrogen-I-modelling-long-term-experimental-results-in-the-South-African-sugar-industry.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D2tC6tQa4kUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 3, "2005": 3, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 6, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
