Despite the growing use of participatory approaches in agricultural DSS development, reflection on this endeavour has largely focused on the \u2018doing\u2019 of participation or the \u2018problem of implementation\u2019 when DSSs have not been adopted by stakeholders. There has been little reference to relevant theoretical approaches to the social processes involved in \u2018participation\u2019 or \u2018implementation\u2019. However, if DSS use is to reach its full potential, a more conceptually informed understanding of how stakeholders collaborate in the participatory development of DSSs is required. To contribute to this conceptualisation, we developed a framework based on three concepts drawn from the field of science and technology studies: technological frames, interpretative flexibility and boundary objects.
