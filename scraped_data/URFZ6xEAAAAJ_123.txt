SER. 1996.", "abstract": "A broad-scale survey of vegetation health, soil, and groundwater conditions was conducted to analyse the factors contributing to black box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) decline. On the basis of these data it was concluded that the decline in black box health at Chowilla is due to water stress, ultimately resulting from the regulation of the River Murray. A more detailed study quantified black box health and structure at seven sites on the floodplain, and provided an initial insight into the causes of the variation. The sites included a range of black box health states and landform types. A site supporting E. camaldulensis (river red gum), another common eucalypt on the floodplain, was included for comparison with the black box. On a point scale of 4 (dead) to 20 (healthy), black box health varied from 4 to 16. The healthier black box communities were classified as closed forests, with the less healthy being woodlands or, where \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16972640771060556344", "cites_id": ["16972640771060556344"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16972640771060556344&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OGJgO9vuiusJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 1, "2011": 3, "2012": 1, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
