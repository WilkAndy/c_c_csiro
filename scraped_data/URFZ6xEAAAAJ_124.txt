Mechanistic models can be used to explore the contribution of mineralised or immobilised N to pasture growth through simulation of plant, soil and environment interactions driven by management.Our objectives were (1) to compare the performance of three agro-ecosystems models (APSIM, DayCent and DairyMod) in simulating soil N, pasture biomass and soil water using the same experimental data in three diverse environments (2), to determine if tactical application of N fertiliser in different seasons could be used to leverage seasonal trends in N mineralisation to influence pasture growth and (3), to explore the sensitivity of N mineralisation to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:nqdriD65xNoC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6256864156045757088", "cites_id": ["6256864156045757088"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721000978", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oEr7tMzY1FYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 14, "2023": 10}}
