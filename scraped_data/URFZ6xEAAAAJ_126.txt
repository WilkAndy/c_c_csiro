Some recent work has shown that this assumption fitted some field data well. Here we calculated  using a steady state solution based on the work by Raats [1971] and an exponential dependence of the diffusivity upon the water content. This is compared with a constant value of  calculated from an assumption of a hydraulic conductivity at the wetting front of 1 mm day\u22121 and the water content at saturation. This comparison was made for a wide range of soils. The constant  generally underestimated  at small wetted radii and overestimated  at large radii. The crossover point between under and overestimation changed with both soil properties and flow rate. The largest variance occurred for coarser texture soils at low\u2010flow rates. At high\u2010flow rates in finer\u2010textured soils \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6638381532274606763", "cites_id": ["6638381532274606763"], "pub_url": "https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003WR002554", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:q8K9-tREIFwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 3, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1}}
