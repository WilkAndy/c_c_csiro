However, the benefits of trashing are complex to determine because of variability in rainfall (between regions and seasons) and the long-term effect of cropping soil systems on N dynamics. In a companion paper a cropping systems model, which accounts for the impacts of water and N stress on sugarcane growth, was shown to predict the long-term response of cane yield and soil organic matter changes under a range of trashing treatments. This paper expands the modelling analysis by examining the benefits of trashing over a wider range of soils and climatic conditions. Possible changes to cane production management practices in the South African sugar industry following the adoption of trashing are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13792797304298947185", "cites_id": ["13792797304298947185"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=9317e55e3bed9e327be9c7fac673f4da1c5a2f90", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cUK0JRLcab8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 6, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 2, "2018": 2, "2019": 4, "2020": 1}}
