In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were used in combination with climate, soil and elevation data to predict field-level sugarcane yield across the multiple sugar mill areas in the Wet Tropics of Australia at different time steps over four consecutive growing seasons (2016\u20132019). A total of \u22481400 field-level measurements were used to train predictive machine learning models of cane yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS, %), sugar yield (t/ha), crop varieties and ratoon numbers. We compared the predictive performance of models based on both satellite imagery only and a fusion of satellite imagery with climate, soil and topographical information. Randomized search on hyperparameters was the method used to optimize and identify the most accurate decision tree \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:_AeoHAGD03cC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3359429452339273431", "cites_id": ["3359429452339273431"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429020312685", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:196qskkXny4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 7, "2022": 13, "2023": 4}}
