Agricultural soils contribute 55% of national N2O emissions, and therefore mitigation of these emissions is important. In the present study, we explored N2O emissions, yield and emissions intensity in a range of management practices in grain crops across eastern Australia with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). The model was initially evaluated against experiments conducted at six field sites across major grain-growing regions in eastern Australia. Measured yields for all crops used in the experiments (wheat, barley, sorghum, maize, cotton, canola and chickpea) and seasonal N2O emissions were satisfactorily predicted with R2=0.93 and R2=0.91 respectively. As expected, N2O emissions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:vDZJ-YLwNdEC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4998744415784344195", "cites_id": ["4998744415784344195"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/sr15376", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gxrLyY8bX0UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 5, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
