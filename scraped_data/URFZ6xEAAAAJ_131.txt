Adoption of the TB system is seen as an important move towards a more sustainable production system. When sugarcane trash is burnt,> 80% of the organic matter and nutrients in the trash are lost (P. Larsen and R. Mitchell, unpublished data). Conversely, with retention of trash, nutrients and organic matter may be accumulating in the soil, which has led to speculation that fertilizer applications should be reduced. The effects of these management changes on the fertility of the canelands, however, are largely unknown. This research was undertaken to investigate the effects of sugarcane trash management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3008035967598609066", "cites_id": ["3008035967598609066"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1079/9780851994659.0000#page=133", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qkJQeMawvikJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 3, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
