The model was parameterised for, and validated against results from a long term (over 23 years) experiment comparing the system-burnt trash and green cane trash blanketing (GCTB), in Linhares-ES. Simulations were conducted over two crop cycles (14 years) with different management (100%, 75%, 50%, 25% GCTB and burnt trash), and N fertiliser rates from 0 to 240 kg ha\u22121 (in 40 kg ha\u22121 increments) on the ratoon crops, and 75% of these rates on the plant crops. Measured cane yields and soil carbon were simulated well by the model. The RMSE (root mean square error) of predictions in burnt and GCTB treatments were 14.02 Mg ha\u22121 and 13.45 Mg ha\u22121 for yield, and 0.09 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5462244245030788163", "cites_id": ["5462244245030788163"], "pub_url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/experimental-agriculture/article/response-of-sugarcane-to-trash-retention-and-nitrogen-in-the-brazilian-coastal-tablelands-a-simulation-study/57254454AD2F387C53D10E451457CEC9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Q1x7XTPKzUsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 6, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
