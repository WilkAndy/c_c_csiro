We propose a novel method of developing guidelines for calibration of process-based models, based on development of recommendations for calibration of the phenology component of crop models. The approach was based on a multi-model study, where all teams were provided with the same data and asked to return simulations for the same conditions. All teams were asked to document in detail their calibration approach, including choices with respect to criteria for best parameters, choice of parameters to estimate and software. Based on an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the various choices, we propose calibration recommendations that cover a comprehensive list of decisions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:AZju0d2GQJ0C", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9459807828392229079", "cites_id": ["9459807828392229079"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815221002486", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1zjHhhn9R4MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
