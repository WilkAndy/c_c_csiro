Casuarina glauca Sieber ex Spreng. has considerable salinity tolerance and is commonly planted in areas with a shallow, saline water table. To evaluate the potential of using the nitrogenous composition of xylem sap to assess salinity stress in C. glauca, the responses of trees grown with various soil salinities in a greenhouse were compared with those of trees growing in field plots with different water table depths and groundwater salinities. In the greenhouse, increasing soil salinity led to increased allocation of nitrogen (N) to proline and arginine in both stem and root xylem sap, with coincident decreases in citrulline and asparagine. Although the field plots were ranked as increasingly saline \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=652981488183908562", "cites_id": ["652981488183908562"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-abstract/22/14/1019/1629664", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0pgbMDTbDwkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 3, "2006": 2, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
