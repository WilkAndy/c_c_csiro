Cropping systems modelling has become agricultural modelling, incorporating new capabilities enabling analyses in the domains of greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon changes, ecosystem services, environmental performance, food security, pests and disease losses, livestock and pasture production, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. New science has been added to the models to support this broadening application domain, and new consortia of modellers have been formed that span the multiple disciplines.There has not, however, been a significant and sustained focus on software platforms to increase efficiency in agricultural production systems research in the interaction between the software industry and the agricultural \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC", "num_citations": 227, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4137944377253017158", "cites_id": ["4137944377253017158"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815214003703", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RrZ9wnzubDkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 26, "2017": 21, "2018": 26, "2019": 34, "2020": 41, "2021": 26, "2022": 31, "2023": 15}}
