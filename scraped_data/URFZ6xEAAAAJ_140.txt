Water and solute balances in soil profiles were used to develop a simple model for assessing the magnitude of macropore flow. Fluxes of water bypassing the soil matrix were calculated at 35 sites to be between 0 and 415 mm y\u22121, with the flux being < 200 mm y\u22121 at most sites. The maximum flux was three times the flux flowing through the soil matrix but only one third of that infiltrating the soil. The flux of macropore flow was not simply related to soil types or soil properties, although the highest fluxes did occur in cracking soils. A qualitative method of using soil chloride profiles to indicate the occurrence (but not magnitude) of bypass flux was also demonstrated. Both these quantitative and qualitative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12261054525881680242", "cites_id": ["12261054525881680242"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00190536", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:coHfIiEEKKoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 2, "1991": 0, "1992": 2, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
