Progress towards this target is insufficient and variable across catchments and industries. The motivation to adopt improvements in management practices is heavily influenced by social, economic, cultural and institutional dimensions. In this paper we synthesise the literature on how these human dimensions influence decision making for land management practice and highlight where future investment could be focussed. We highlight that focussing on \u20141) investigating systems to support landholder decision making under climate uncertainty (risk); 2) generating a better understanding of the extent \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:yY3RG6sOEgwC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14644885981540455187", "cites_id": ["14644885981540455187"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X21006627", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ExPRUTUWPcsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 14, "2023": 3}}
