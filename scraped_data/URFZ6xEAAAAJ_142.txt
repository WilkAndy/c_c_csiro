An alliance of collaborative on-ground water quality monitoring (Project 25) and technologically driven digital application development (Digiscape GBR) projects were formulated to provide data that highlighted the contribution of a network of Australian sugar cane farmers, amongst other sources, to nutrient runoff. This environmental data and subsequent information were extended to the farming community through scientist-led feedback sessions and the development of specialised digital technology (1622\u2122WQ) that help build an understanding of the nutrient movements, in this case nitrogen, such that farmers might think about and eventually act to alter their fertilizer application practices. This paper reflects on a socio-environmental sustainability challenge that emerged \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4583070292846267693", "cites_id": ["4583070292846267693"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-020-00885-9", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LU2_MSZWmj8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 12, "2023": 3}}
