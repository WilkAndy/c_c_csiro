In specific, we trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform multi-label scene classification of high-resolution (<;10 m) satellite imagery. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in training deep CNN models for multi-label scene classification. Finally, we investigate the transferability of our PlanetScope-trained models to freely available Sentinel-2 imagery acquired over the wet tropics of Australia. Our best performing model achieved an F \u03b2  of 0.91, which was only 2% short of the top performing model in the Understanding the Amazon from Space Kaggle competition [1]. We also find that our \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18088488542550920219", "cites_id": ["18088488542550920219"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8517499/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G4x4Fn44B_sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 8, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
