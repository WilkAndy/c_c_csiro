Projected increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and temperature and changes in rainfall patterns act quite differently on crop yields (Asseng et al., 2013, Asseng et al., 2015, Porter et al., 2014, Trnka et al., 2014) and product quality (Martre et al., 2006, Myers et al., 2014), which may improve or decline depending on the region (Challinor et al., 2014, IPCC, 2014, Wheeler and von Braun, 2013). Drought and heat impose stresses on crops, resulting in reduced biomass accumulation (Barlow et al., 2015, Lobell et al., 2011), accelerated senescence (Wardlaw and Moncur, 1995) and\u2013in specific cases\u2013infertile \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:OBSaB-F7qqsC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2592177671238689737", "cites_id": ["2592177671238689737"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2592177671238689737&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yaPhqNtD-SMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 5, "2022": 1}}
