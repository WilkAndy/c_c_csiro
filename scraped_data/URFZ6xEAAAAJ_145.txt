One key reason is that agricultural chains are subjected to the considerable managerial, social and biophysical complexity, which often leads to the inappropriate use of different methods. We capture supply chain complexity by formulating a matrix of biophysical by management factors. This is used to comprehend supply chain complexity and show how participants in agricultural chains can implement adaptation strategies that add value to their industry. Through various case studies we illustrate how adaptation strategies adopted by chain participants relate to different quadrants of the complexity matrix. An analysis of the literature based on this matrix also shows the suitability of different types of technical methods when used within adaptation strategies of each matrix quadrant.
