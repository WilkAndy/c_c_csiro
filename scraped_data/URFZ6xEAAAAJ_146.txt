However, on some Vertisols these techniques give adverse soil conditions for crop growth. The effect of different fallow management techniques on soil physical properties of one of these soils was investigated. Soil structural and hydrologic properties were determined under three tillage and two stubble fallow management treatments. Measurements were made immediately prior to planting a crop, and some were repeated after harvest. Zero tillage increased bulk density, shear strength, penetrometer resistance and aggregate size (as did stubble retention) at planting, compared with blade or disc plough tillage. These results indicate that seedbed conditions were less favourable for crop establishment under this treatment.
