Australian", "abstract": "Salinity and sodicity problems have been a restraint on agricultural use of $ oils for many centuries. Soil salinity is considered in forms of a salt balance in the soil profile where, under steady state conditions, mass of salt in equals mass of salt out. Soil salinity is the expression of salt concentration and thus is a useful indication of toil hydrology. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of sail salinity measurement methods are listed. A conversion from EC1: 5 to EC saturation extract and EC soil based on clay content and salt composition allows better interpretation of available data and of the processes operating. Criteria for salinity and sodicity which relate to soil behaviour and plant response ore discussed. Criteria are essentially a rule of thumb guide for average conditions and their use and interpretation need to be flexible. Soil properties determining leaching and thus salt balance are discussed and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:iyewoVqAXLQC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14371469526877041580", "cites_id": ["14371469526877041580"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14371469526877041580&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rHPbMWS3cccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 1, "1991": 0, "1992": 1, "1993": 1, "1994": 2, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
