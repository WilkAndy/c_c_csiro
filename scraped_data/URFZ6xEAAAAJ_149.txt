Forest. Res 3, 161-178, 2008", "author": "Rob GV Bramley and Patricia A Hill and Peter J Thorburn and Frederieke J Kroon and Kerstin Panten", "journal": "Agric. Forest. Res", "volume": "3", "pages": "161-178", "abstract": "Precision Agriculture (PA) can be regarded as a means of increasing the chance that the inputs to production are applied in the right amounts in the right place at the right time. Intuitively, if farmers adopting PA are successful in achieving this objective, the likelihood of negative environmental impacts arising should be reduced. Conversely, where the likelihood of a negative environmental impact is shown to be high, the opportunity for reducing the amount of inputs used, and/or increasing their efficiency of use, should be apparent.This paper explores these issues using examples from the Australian sugar and dairy industries. We conclude that the use of spatial data to better inform agricultural management can make a valuable contribution to reducing the risk of negative environmental impact whether applied in the implementation of PA (field and within-field scales) or at whole farm or regional scales. However, for the maximum environmental benefit to accrue through PA, the existing regional or whole-of-industry management guidelines need to be replaced by guidelines for sitespecific management. This in turn will require a considerable enhancement to existing agronomic understanding."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8158977273104996456", "cites_id": ["8158977273104996456"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Thorburn/publication/230667539_Precision_Agriculture_for_improved_environmental_outcomes_Some_Australian_perspectives_Landbauforschung-vTi/links/02e7e5153c62981784000000/Precision-Agriculture-for-improved-environmental-outcomes-Some-Australian-perspectives-Landbauforschung-vTi.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aJjoDZqCOnEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 2, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
