However, these benefits are unlikely to be realised if the social implications of these technological innovations are not adequately considered by those who promote them. Big Data applications are intrinsically socio-technical; their development and deployment are a product of social interactions between people, institutional and regulatory settings, as well as the technology itself. This paper explores the socio-technical factors and conditions that influence the development of Smart Farming and Big Data applications, using a multi-level perspective on transitions combined with social practice theory. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 Australian grain farmers and industry stakeholders to elicit their perspectives on benefits and risks of these changes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C", "num_citations": 217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17753515480217126853,6078658503625064558,16733040162839964627", "cites_id": ["17753515480217126853", "6078658503625064558", "16733040162839964627"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573521418301842", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xYe9YEQoYfYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 20, "2020": 20, "2021": 74, "2022": 74, "2023": 28}}
