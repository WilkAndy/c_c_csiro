To test this hypothesis, sugarcane and sugar yields were measured in a trial comparing five nitrogen rates, and results are presented after three crop harvests. In all crops, the application of nitrogen significantly increased crop and sugar yield with the overall trend favouring the 90 (plant)/120 (ratoon) kg/ha nitrogen treatment. This was a lower application of nitrogen than would be conventionally used at this site in Queensland. There was more than 200 kg/ha of mineral nitrogen in the soil to 2 m depth immediately prior to the site being planted. This nitrogen was reduced to 11 kg/ha at the start of the second ratoon crop. Least depletion occurred in the highest nitrogen treatment (180/240 kg/ha) with substantial nitrogen remaining deep (below 1.2 m) in the soil profile. This deep nitrogen was depleted in treatments receiving less nitrogen. A basic nitrogen balance suggested that at least 24 kg/ha of nitrogen was lost to the environment from the highest nitrogen treatment. Apart from reduced nitrogen applications, trickle irrigation allows for in-crop adjustments to nitrogen management to overcome problems such as loss of nitrogen in very wet periods. This is an economically and environmentally advantageous means of managing nitrogen for such problems compared with continual over-fertilisation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 19, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10339143252974075928", "cites_id": ["10339143252974075928"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20000709251", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:GIBlawIEfI8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 2, "2003": 5, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 3, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
