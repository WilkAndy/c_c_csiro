Changes to agricultural practices can provide GHG abatement by maintaining or increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in soils or vegetation, or by decreasing N2O emissions. However, it can be difficult to identify practices that achieve net abatement because practices that increase SOC stocks may also increase N2O emissions from the soil. This study simulated the net on-farm GHG abatement and gross margins for a range of management scenarios on two grain farms from the western and southern grain growing regions of Australia using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. The soils and practices selected for the study were typical of these regions. Increased cropping intensity consistently provided emissions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17044897769064742133", "cites_id": ["17044897769064742133"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X16301913", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9bzzlTaki-wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 6, "2021": 2, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
