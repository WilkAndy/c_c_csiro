Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were estimated to be higher under subtropical than under temperate climates. So mitigation of N2O emissions from subtropical farming systems can make an important contribution to reducing global warming. Accordingly, in this study we explored long-term N2O emissions and possible mitigation options for representative subtropical cropping systems (e.g., summer versus winter crops, inclusion of a legume in the rotation) and management practices (nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation) by calculating scenarios with the agricultural systems model APSIM. The model was tested against high temporal frequency data from experiments conducted on an oxisol and a vertisol in subtropical Australia, which comprised a number of fertilization and irrigation treatments.
