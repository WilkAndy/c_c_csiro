The Australian sugar industry has a history of high N fertiliser usage, with applications increasing from the 1960s to the late 1990s. However, industry average sugarcane production has not kept pace with N fertiliser applications, resulting in a steady increase in N fertiliser applied per ton of sugarcane harvested. Historical and recently developed N management strategies rely on matching N applications to the predicted/expected yield of the forthcoming crop. High applications of N fertiliser by farmers are a rational reaction to (i) the uncertainty of these predictions/expectations, and (ii) the yield reductions caused by long-term under-fertilising with N. While sustained under-application of N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC", "num_citations": 17, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14657557529962386336", "cites_id": ["14657557529962386336"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Thorburn/publication/228465115_Which_is_the_most_important_crop_when_assessing_nitrogen_applications-the_next_or_the_last/links/02e7e5153c62a2d8a0000000/Which-is-the-most-important-crop-when-assessing-nitrogen-applications-the-next-or-the-last.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oJNCGOoaassJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
