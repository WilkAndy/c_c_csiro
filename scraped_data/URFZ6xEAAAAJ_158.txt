The most recently developed nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) is gaining popularity due to its benefits relative to other compounds. However, the behaviour of DMPP and its effect on nitrification in soils has been characterised using inconsistent and confusing terminology. Many studies have used the term half-life to describe the persistence of DMPP but used different experimental methods to derive it leading to highly variable results. We assessed how different methodologies in experiments may have contributed to the variability in the results using a framework that describes the behaviour of DMPP and its effect on nitrification in terms of: persistence, bioactivity and longevity. We show that deriving the persistence of DMPP using 14C labelling techniques \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1424345333417563649", "cites_id": ["1424345333417563649"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719314780", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AdbWw4hKxBMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 6, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
