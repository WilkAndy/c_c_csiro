Global recognition of its Outstanding Universal Value resulted in the listing of the 348 000 km2 GBR World Heritage Area (WHA) by UNESCO in 1981. Despite various levels of national and international protection, the condition of GBR ecosystems has deteriorated over the past decades, with land\u2010based pollution from the adjacent catchments being a major and ongoing cause for this decline. To reduce land\u2010based pollution, the Australian and Queensland Governments have implemented a range of policy initiatives since 2003. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing initiatives to reduce discharge of land\u2010based pollutants into the waters of the GBR. We conclude that recent efforts in the GBR catchments to reduce land\u2010based pollution are unlikely to be sufficient to protect the GBR \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC", "num_citations": 205, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14545782188069032601", "cites_id": ["14545782188069032601"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13262", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mRIPTNX_3MkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 5, "2017": 17, "2018": 34, "2019": 28, "2020": 38, "2021": 39, "2022": 28, "2023": 12}}
