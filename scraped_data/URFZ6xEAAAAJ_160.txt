CSIRO: Water for Healthy Country National Research Flagship", "pub_year": 2010, "citation": "CSIRO, 2010", "author": "ME Van Grieken and AJ Webster and M Poggio and Peter Thorburn and Jody Biggs and C Stokes and C McDonald", "publisher": "CSIRO", "abstract": "In this report we analyse implementation costs and benefits for agricultural management practices, grouped into farming systems. In order to do so, we compare plot scale gross margins for the dominant agricultural production systems (sugarcane, grazing and banana cultivation) in the NRM regions Wet Tropics, Burdekin Dry Tropics and Mackay Whitsundays. Furthermore, where available, we present investment requirements for changing to improved farming systems. It must be noted that transaction costs are not captured within this project.  For sugarcane, this economic analysis shows that there are expected benefits to sugarcane growers in the different regions through transitions to C and B class farming systems. Further transition to A-class farming systems can come at a cost, depending on the capital investment required and the length of the investment period. Obviously, the costs and benefits will vary for each individual grower and will depend on their starting point and individual property scenario therefore each circumstance needs to be carefully considered before making a change in management practice.  In grazing, overall, reducing stocking rates comes at a cost (reduced benefits). However, when operating at low utilisation rates in wetter country, lowering stocking rates can potentially come at a benefit. With win-win potential, extension is preferred to assist farmer in changing management practices to improve their land condition. When reducing stocking rates comes at a cost, incentives may be applicable to support change among farmers.  For banana cultivation, the results indicate that the transition to C and B class management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9775776824145815060", "cites_id": ["9775776824145815060"], "pub_url": "http://era.daf.qld.gov.au/id/eprint/3494/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FCa1LjqJqocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 5, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 2, "2021": 3}}
