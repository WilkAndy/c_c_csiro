Queensland (Australia) coastal regions depend upon groundwater for irrigation and urban supply and the groundwater also has direct links to surface waters and marine environments. Therefore, any contamination that impacts on groundwater is undesirable. Temporal analysis was used to determine trends of nitrate contamination of groundwaters and their implications in the regions of Mackay and Burdekin. In 1997, nitrate concentrations in 397 bores in the Burdekin and 165 bores in the Mackay regions were determined, and bores with nitrate concentrations greater than 20 mg/litre (56 and 34 bores, respectively) were subsequently resampled eight times, from October 1998 to June 2000. In Mackay, nitrate concentrations in 15% of the bores fell while nitrate concentrations in 12% rose. In the Burdekin, 90% of bores did not demonstrate any significant temporal trends, with 6%(three bores) having decreasing nitrate concentrations and 4%(two bores) with rising concentrations. The results suggest that groundwater nitrate contamination is not increasing in these areas but also is generally not improving. Therefore, efforts to minimize nitrate leaching from urban and agricultural sources must be maintained to ensure the preservation of a valuable source of drinking water and the protection of environments into which groundwaters discharge."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6409060303260290248", "cites_id": ["6409060303260290248"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013056971", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yAzjn2OO8VgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 3, "2006": 1, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
