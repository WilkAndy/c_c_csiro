Evaluating how well crop phenology can be predicted is therefore of major interest. Twenty-eight wheat modeling groups participated in this evaluation. Our target population was wheat fields in the major wheat growing regions of Australia under current climatic conditions and with current local management practices. The environments used for calibration and for evaluation were both sampled from this same target population. The calibration and evaluation environments had neither sites nor years in common, so this is a rigorous evaluation of the ability of modeling groups to predict phenology for new sites and weather conditions. Mean absolute error (MAE) for the evaluation environments, averaged over predictions of three phenological stages and over \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2021597434551215166", "cites_id": ["2021597434551215166"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192320303919", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PiRE5ScoDhwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 5, "2022": 9}}
