Despite various data-driven models in water quality prediction, most studies focus on predicting a single water quality variable. When multiple water quality variables need to be estimated, preparing several data-driven models may require unaffordable computing resources. Also, the changing patterns of several water quality variables can only be revealed by processing long term historical observations, which is not well supported by conventional data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a multi-task temporal convolution network (MTCN) for predicting multiple water quality variables. The temporal convolution offers one the capability to explore the temporal dependencies among a remarkably long historical period. Furthermore, instead of providing predictions for only one water quality variable, the MTCN \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5745421550686528714", "cites_id": ["5745421550686528714"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-36808-1_14", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ymSLtXXWu08J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 4}}
