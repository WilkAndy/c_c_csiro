Under the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting program (P2R) of the Reef Plan, the impacts of improved agricultural management practices on water quality entering the GBR are modelled to evaluate the effectiveness of Government water quality improvement policies. The Source Catchments modelling framework estimates loads of pollutants entering the GBR lagoon from rivers. However, Source Catchments does not have the capacity to represent the collection of management practices available to farmers that affect water quality in runoff and drainage at a paddock scale. Therefore, paddock scale agricultural systems models were used to demonstrate the effects of management practice adoption and to provide input to the catchment scale models. Paddock scale models were used because they represent a level of process detail compatible with the management practice investments and implementation on-ground. A fit-for-purpose modelling approach was used, where the paddock model most suited to a given land use and/or water quality pollutant was applied. Three one-dimensional agricultural systems models were employed; HowLeaky in grains, APSIM in sugarcane with HowLeaky post-processing for herbicides and phosphorous and GRASP in grazing lands. These models share similar soil water balance, ground cover and runoff sub-models. However, they vary in the level of detail, particularly in terms of representing crop growth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15124791253943692768", "cites_id": ["15124791253943692768"], "pub_url": "http://era.daf.qld.gov.au/id/eprint/8707/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4K0_yYIN5tEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 0, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 4, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
