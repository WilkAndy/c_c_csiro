This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of best management practice (BMP) adoption at the farm level, for control of sediment and nutrient supply from agricultural lands in the Douglas Shire catchments. More specifically, the objectives of this study are to: 1. determine the private-economic consequences of BMP adoption, 2. determine the effectiveness of BMP adoption in reducing sediment supply, and3. assess the effectiveness of regulations and incentives that promote the adoption of BMPs.We develop an approach that is based on the integration of a financial-economic analysis of actual and best management practices in sugarcane and beef cattle production at the plot level, and a private-economic Farm Household Modelling approach for key agricultural producers at the farm level. This approach not only provides insight in the likelihood of adoption of best management practices by agricultural producers and subsequent private-economic and water quality effects, but also enables the identification of incentives and regulations that are likely to be most (cost-) effective in promoting the adoption of best management practices. We show that best management practices in sugarcane production (such as reduced tillage, legume fallow and reduced nitrogen application) are economically viable at the farm level and, therefore, likely to be adopted by sugarcane producers in the Douglas Shire with appropriate support in the form of information provision, extension and demonstration \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1091067227999780469", "cites_id": ["1091067227999780469"], "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=7101260bb20f24c2ee488021957c40fda733039e", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dT7_9tw_JA8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
