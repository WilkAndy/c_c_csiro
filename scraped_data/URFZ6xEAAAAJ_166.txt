The mean \u03b42H and \u03b418O values of water extracted from the upper tap root and lower crown regions were < 1\u2030 and 0.3\u2030 different from that of water transpired, respectively, with an analytical precision similar to that found in previous studies on soils and trees. Water from other plant parts closer to the leaves was enriched in 2H (up to 12.6 in upper stems) and 18O (4.2\u2030) with respect to that transpired. The enrichment was associated with a greater variability in \u03b42H values between replicate plants. \u03b42H\u2010\u03b418O data indicated that the isotopic enrichment was due to evaporation during transpiration.
