This paper combines a solute mass balance model and a furrow irrigation advance model to provide an estimate of these fluxes, indirectly from simpler measurements. The models were applied to a newly cleared sodic duplex soil from the Burdekin River Irrigation Area, north Queensland, where no field measures of infiltration and deep drainage were available. The study site was sown to consecutive furrow-irrigated crops after clearing. In applying these models, measures of soil and irrigation water chloride, irrigation water applied, furrow geometry and irrigation advance were required. Estimated infiltration and deep drainage decreased with distance down the furrow from 1044 and 98 mm year-1 at 50 m to 966 and 0 mm year-1 at 260 m.
