Previous reviewed economic assessments of N management in agricultural production seldom consider broader environmental impacts and uncertain climatic and economic conditions. This paper presents an economic risk framework for assessing economic and environmental trade-offs of N management strategies taking into account variable climatic and economic conditions. The framework is underpinned by a modelling platform that integrates Agricultural Production System sIMulation modelling (APSIM), probability theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and financial risk analysis techniques. We applied the framework to a case study in Tully, a coastal catchment in north-eastern Australia with a well \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:YsrPvlHIBpEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14585105246208420645", "cites_id": ["14585105246208420645"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718306650", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JWvwO_KzaMoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
