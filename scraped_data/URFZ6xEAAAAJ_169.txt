It includes two spring wheat cultivars grown during two consecutive winter cropping cycles at hot, irrigated, and low latitude sites in Mexico (Ciudad Obregon and Tlaltizapan), Egypt (Aswan), India (Dharwar), the Sudan (Wad Medani), and Bangladesh (Dinajpur). Experiments in Mexico included normal (November-December) and late (January-March) sowing dates. Data include local daily weather data, soil characteristics and initial soil conditions, crop measurements (anthesis and maturity dates, anthesis and final total above ground biomass, final grain yields and yields components), and cultivar information. Simulations include both daily in-season and end-of-season results from 30 wheat models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5460653563587428098", "cites_id": ["5460653563587428098"], "pub_url": "https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/166950", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:An8Z-3sjyEsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
