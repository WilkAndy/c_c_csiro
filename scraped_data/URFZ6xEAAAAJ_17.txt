This partitioning was achieved by identifying the source of the transpired water with naturally occurring stable isotopes of water. Transpiration rates were low, being about 0.3 mm day\u22121 from three E. largiflorens sites and up to 2 mm day\u22121 from an E. camaldulensis site. There was no significant variation in transpiration across seasons, indicating that transpiration was limited by environmental factors other than evaporative demand. Despite its salinity (electrical conductivities of 11\u201333 dS m\u22121), the groundwater was used by the forests at all sites and all times, and made up 100% of transpiration in more than half of the measurements, and 40\u201380% in the remainder \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 197, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10084631207080517266", "cites_id": ["10084631207080517266"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002216949390126T", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kl7a9KbO84sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 3, "1995": 4, "1996": 9, "1997": 6, "1998": 5, "1999": 11, "2000": 2, "2001": 7, "2002": 6, "2003": 8, "2004": 5, "2005": 9, "2006": 11, "2007": 6, "2008": 5, "2009": 13, "2010": 7, "2011": 12, "2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 15, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 7, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 1}}
