This conversion results in substantial net mineralisation of soil organic matter that builds up during a phase of pasture. A few studies have shown that this mineralisation leads to increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions compared to long-term pasture or long-term cropping. Understanding of interactions leading to these significant emissions is still scarce but is needed to identify mitigation options for this situation. In this study, the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) was used to investigate the optimal timing of pasture termination (relative to crop planting) and management of nitrogen (N) in crops after pasture termination to maximise crop yield and limit N2O emissions. Beforehand, APSIM\u2019s performance in simulating yields and N2O emissions was tested against data from field experiments conducted in the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12351820472654822602", "cites_id": ["12351820472654822602"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030116301198", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yvz88UZ7aqsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 4, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
