The wet tropics is therefore an important region to study, and a valuable region in which to validate and test modelling tools that may be applied to the nation-wide assessment and design of new plant production systems. Site-specific solutions will be required to meet the area\u2019s unique environmental characteristics, and its closeness to the Great Barrier Reef demands that these issues receive urgent attention.This report provides a review of water and nitrogen balance in natural (rainforest) and agricultural (sugarcane and horticulture) systems in the tropics, with a special focus on the North Queensland wet tropics (see Appendix 1 for Terms of Reference).
