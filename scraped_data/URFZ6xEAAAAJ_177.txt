In response to this, and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (2011), regional authorities across New Zealand are developing plans to manage water quality. Many of these plans include use of OVERSEER\u00ae, a computer model originally designed to assist farmers and their advisors with on-farm nutrient use, for estimating nitrate losses from individual pastoral farms.Given this emerging and new regulatory role for OVERSEER\u00ae, and the relatively recent addition of crop modelling to the programme, the Foundation for Arable Research (FAR) commissioned a review of the arable cropping model of OVERSEER\u00ae. The purpose of the review was to assess the strengths, weaknesses and further developments that would improve the usefulness and usability of the cropping model of OVERSEER\u00ae."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17296097379209024856", "cites_id": ["17296097379209024856"], "pub_url": "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~flrc/workshops/13/Manuscripts/Paper_Williams_2013.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WJVRgO0UCPAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 4, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
