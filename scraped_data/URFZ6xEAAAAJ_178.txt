Since 2003, we have initiated 12 on-farm field experiments to test the \u2018N replacement\u2019concept in the range of environments spanned by the Australian industry. In conjunction with field trials, we also increased efforts on monitoring N stress in cane using Near Infra Red Reflectance instruments (NIR) located at sugar mills. Field results so far are encouraging, with little average difference (0.3 t/ha) in yield between replacement and conventional N treatments. Soil N does not appear to have been \u2018mined\u2019with reduced N fertiliser application. Profitability has been marginally increased while risks of N losses to the environment, estimated from N balances at the sites, are considerably lower in the N replacement treatments. Good NIR calibrations have been obtained for predicting sugarcane N concentration. Using these, mill-monitored stem N compared well with field measurements at two sites. Where there are needs to improve profitability and reduce environmental impacts of sugarcane production, the N replacement concept may be worth investigation."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2650427546146303536", "cites_id": ["2650427546146303536"], "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/32514904/pfwc.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MO71hs81yCQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 4, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
