However, there is little information on the extent of the possible reduction in N application for many fertigated crops, particularly sugarcane, which is one of the major row crops grown under trickle irrigation and the major crop grown in north eastern Australia. In this study, a cropping systems model (APSIM) was modified to represent sub-surface application of water and N to crops as an approximation of sub-surface trickle irrigation systems. The performance of the model was assessed relative to measurements from a five year sugarcane sub-surface trickle irrigation/fertigation N response experiment. Absolute cane yields were over-predicted, but relative response of yield to applied N was well predicted. The long-term response of sugarcane yields to a wide range of N application rates were then simulated for both the surface and sub-surface application of water and N. Simulations showed that the benefits of sub-surface application of water and N will be either a saving in N fertiliser for similar yield, as expected, or an increase in yield for similar N inputs. Whichever of these is most desirable will depend on the specific economic circumstances of the sugarcane production system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7444236078750246201", "cites_id": ["7444236078750246201"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2003/c/5/thorburn.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OSUOukU9T2cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
