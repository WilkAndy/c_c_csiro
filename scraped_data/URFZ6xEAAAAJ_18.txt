Recent field measurements of sugar cane residue decomposition have found that rates of residue decomposition are slower than those predicted by the agricultural productions systems simulator (APSIM) cropping system model. To improve predictions of sugar cane residue decomposition in APSIM, a new function relating decomposition rate to mass of residues was developed, and parameter values in other functions modified in the APSIM\u2013Residue model. Predictions were compared to measurements of residue decomposition made over 1 year in five field experiments located at sites with contrasting climates in the Australian sugar industry. The new function was found to provide more accurate predictions of decomposition of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C", "num_citations": 195, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11201198252163335571", "cites_id": ["11201198252163335571"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429001001411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kwXsvnamcpsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 4, "2002": 2, "2003": 7, "2004": 6, "2005": 3, "2006": 5, "2007": 13, "2008": 6, "2009": 7, "2010": 5, "2011": 11, "2012": 13, "2013": 7, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 16, "2017": 15, "2018": 19, "2019": 3, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 12, "2023": 5}}
