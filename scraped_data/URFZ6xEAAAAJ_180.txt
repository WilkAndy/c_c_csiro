There has been a significant focus in recent years on improving models, and modelling techniques so they better serve the needs of society. Two major communities have formed to support these efforts in crop modelling: the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (Rosenzweig et al 2013; AgMIP, www. agmip. org) and the European Knowledge Hub Modelling European Agriculture with Climate Change for Food Security (R\u00f6tter et al 2013; MACSUR, www. macsur. eu). From these communities there are many examples of identifying and overcoming weaknesses in models, which have led to improved information and understanding of ways to enhance future food security. Despite this progress it is still valuable to ask: what \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2932259230959426936", "cites_id": ["2932259230959426936"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2932259230959426936&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eF2yGjx6sSgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 4, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
