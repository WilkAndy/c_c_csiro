The HSC experiment was conducted in an open-field in a semiarid environment in the southwest USA. The data reported herein include one hard red spring wheat cultivar (Yecora Rojo) sown approximately every six weeks from December to August for a two year period for a total of 11 planting dates out of the 15 of the entire HSC experiment. The treatments were chosen to avoid any effects of frost on grain yields. For the late fall, winter, and early spring plantings, temperature free-air controlled enhancement (T-FACE) apparatus utilizing infrared heaters with supplemental irrigation were used to increase air temperature by 1.3\u00b0C/2.7\u00b0C (day/night) with conditions equivalent to raising air temperature at constant relative humidity (i.e. as expected with global warming) during the whole crop growth cycle. Experimental data include local daily weather data, soil characteristics and initial conditions, detailed crop measurements taken at three growth stages during the growth cycle, and cultivar information. Simulations include both daily in-season and end-of-season results from 30 wheat models."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:w1MjKQ0l0TYC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12332459012840636515", "cites_id": ["12332459012840636515"], "pub_url": "https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/8wqx8/the-hot-serial-cereal-experiment-for-modeling-wheat-response-to-temperature-field-experiments-and-agmip-wheat-multi-model-simulations", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y0BuyyGyJasJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 1}}
