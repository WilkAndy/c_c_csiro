Studies of climate change impact are important both to understand the magnitude of the effect, and to develop strategies to adapt to the changing climate. Increasingly, these studies will need to integrate multiple information sources about possible future climates, climate\u2013-agriculture interactions, and economic drivers for, and consequences of the impacts and adaptation strategies. In short, the studies will be integrated climate change impact assessments, ideally conducted on a regional scale to capture regional variations in climate, soils, agriculture, and economics. There have been numerous climate change impact assessments undertaken in the past. These studies have used different climate scenarios, different approaches to defining and modeling agricultural systems, and different economic assumptions. As a result, it is difficult to compare the results of these studies (Rosenzweig et al., 2013). Additionally, uncertainty has often only been explicitly addressed in climate projections through the use of ensembles of global climate models (GCMs): Uncertainties in other aspects of the integrated system have been overlooked, including the variability contributed by the uncertainty of climate response of different multiple agroecosystem models.
