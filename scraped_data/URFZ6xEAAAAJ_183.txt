Often antagonistic relations between segments, particularly farmers and millers, led to each developing their systems for their own segment's benefit, without reference to the wider industry interests. Cane growing developed into a monoculture, reliant on material inputs and technological solutions, whose low labour intensity afforded substantial lifestyle benefits to growers. Such a system worked well while the industry was the worldwide cost leader, but it has contributed to stagnating yields and left growers exposed to the industry downturn caused by Brazilian competition.Over the past few years, CSIRO and BSES research aimed at securing industry-wide cost savings included the logistical optimisation of the harvesting and transport segments, harvest scheduling to maximise sugar yield \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4729034471378560611", "cites_id": ["4729034471378560611"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.198088099059945", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y6YY1cvnoEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 2, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 2, "2018": 1}}
