Of this data, water quality attracts great attention due to its intended use for crop irrigation, livestock, and other farming activities. Accurate and reliable water quality measurements enable farmers to understand the landscape comprehensively, optimising resource utilisation and reducing the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment. In practice, missing and incomplete data can create biased estimations and reduce the efficiency of many of the valuable applications provided by digital agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to propose a dual-head sequence-to-sequence imputation model (Dual-SSIM) designed to impute missing time series data in sensor networks, therefore reducing the negative consequences of missing and incomplete data.
