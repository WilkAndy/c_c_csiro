This paper presents lessons from a review of the available, published evidence. It also presents early results from SRA project 2014/011 characterising N release from a range of controlled release fertiliser products and uses modelling to explore N uptake patterns and N loss pathways. The modelling also provides insights into how yield or fertiliser N use efficiency benefits will likely occur."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=492867713256466154", "cites_id": ["492867713256466154"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173009419", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6ibp6ZIE1wYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 4, "2018": 0, "2019": 3, "2020": 2, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
