These methods were used by the AgMIP Regional Research Teams in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to implement the analyses reported in their respective chapters of this book. Additional technical details for these methods are provided in the Guide for Regional IntegratedAssessments: Handbook of Methods and Procedures, available on the AgMIP web site http://agmip. org."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9029971777317494210", "cites_id": ["9029971777317494210"], "pub_url": "https://web.stanford.edu/group/emf-research/docs/sm/2014/Antle_additional.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wt3PFn3nUH0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 1, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
