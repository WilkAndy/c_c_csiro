Since the residues that would have been lost in the fire are returned to the soil, nutrients and organic matter may be accumulating under trash blanketing. There is a need to know if this is the case, to better manage fertiliser inputs and maintain soil fertility. The objective of this work was to determine whether conversion from a burning to a GCTB trash management system is likely to affect soil fertility in terms of C and N. Indicators of short- and long-term soil C and N cycling were measured in 5 field experiments in contrasting climatic conditions. The effects of GCTB varied among experiments. Experiments that had been running for 1\u20132 years (Harwood) showed no significant trash management effects. In experiments that had been running for 3\u20136 years (Mackay and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC", "num_citations": 179, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=117458749647031885", "cites_id": ["117458749647031885"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/sr06080", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TQ55SBxMoQEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 4, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 11, "2011": 11, "2012": 13, "2013": 21, "2014": 9, "2015": 10, "2016": 18, "2017": 22, "2018": 15, "2019": 12, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 10, "2023": 4}}
