In parallel, government policies shaped the unique structure and culture of the sugar industry throughout Queensland, directly and indirectly affecting sugarcane cultivation practices. Despite government environmental policies and strategies, the nutrient run-off from sugarcane cultivation continues to impact on the coastal landscape and health of the Great Barrier Reef.
