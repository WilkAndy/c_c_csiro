This has led to the development of the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (Anon 2003), which will require industries in catchments draining into the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to meet water quality targets. As well as concerns over the GBR, there are other important environmental issues in these catchments, such as the quality of groundwater (Thorburn et al. 2002, Rasiah et al. 2003) or the ambient water quality conditions of freshwater ecosystems in coastal wetlands (Rayment 2003). Management practices to address GBR water quality concerns are likely to provide benefits for these other environmental issues, so a holistic approach should be taken to these problems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6851615596274476195", "cites_id": ["6851615596274476195"], "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/29257/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o2R3WRXUFV8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 1}}
