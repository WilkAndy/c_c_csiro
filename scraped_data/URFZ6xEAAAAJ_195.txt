Receiving an annual rainfall of 684 mm, brigalow forest yields 26 mm yr super(-+) of runoff and negligible deep drainage. During the four years after clearing, mean annual runoff doubled but increases in drainage only occurred in the initial year after clearing, prior to establishing crops and pasture. In the long term, land owners must manage for the occasional wet period which causes bare ground to produce large volumes of runoff and substantial increases in deep drainage from fallow wheat catchments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7808815079416105459", "cites_id": ["7808815079416105459"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7808815079416105459&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:84lPHfF7XmwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1995": 1, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
