Accurate crop simulation models are important tools in this process. This paper reports on the suitability of the DSSAT-Canegro model for simulating sugarcane growth and yield for a wide range of environments across the globe under current and possible future climates. The protocols proposed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) for the assessment of crop models for global climate change applications were followed. Experimental data from 35 treatments, in 10 experiments at sites in Australia, Brazil, Ecuador, Reunion, South Africa, the USA and Zimbabwe were used to calibrate the model in two stages:(1)'blind'calibration, whereby only management, weather and soil data are provided, and (2)'phenology'calibration with stage 1 data as well as crop development observations. The model was also subjected to sensitivity analysis, whereby 30 seasons of sugarcane growth were simulated at each site, using historical weather data perturbed by changes to daily air temperatures (-3, 0,+ 3,+ 6 and+ 9 C), rainfall (-25,-10, 0%,+ 10 and+ 25%) and atmospheric CO 2 concentration (+ 90,+ 190,+ 290 and+ 390 ppm). Model performance in predicting stalk dry mass (SDM) was not as good as quoted in previous studies. Using leaf and tiller phenology data for model calibration did not improve model performance, highlighting the need for using leaf area index and biomass data for meaningful calibration. The study also highlighted the need for global model testing in diverse environments and production \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Ehil0879vHcC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2954535308109414819", "cites_id": ["2954535308109414819"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20163376330", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:owE2fDWeACkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
