As a result there is impetus to consider diversifying products from the raw sugar production value chain. The chain is complex however, and alternative products will necessitate substantial changes to the chain, the impacts of which will be difficult to predict a priori. Modelling offers insights into the impacts of, and benefits from changes to value chains. Analyses of the chain should, ideally, be conducted in enough biophysical detail to allow the logistical challenges to be properly analysed. The application of these modelling techniques in a participatory environment would allow groups within mill regions to more thoroughly evaluate diversification options of their sugar value chains in their region, and so move forward with more confidence and greater understanding than occurs with other approaches. While participatory modelling has previously been undertaken for issues in one or two sectors of the Australian sugar value chain, it has not been attempted for the whole of the chain before. In this project we aimed to facilitate the improved economic efficiency of the sugar industry value chain through developing and participatively applying an innovative modelling capability that allowed industry groups to identify and evaluate sugar value chain diversification options. The project was conducted in partnership with all sectors of the Burdekin and Maryborough industries. The first phase of the project entailed working with the regional groups to identify and prioritise potential diversification options for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9193437648693721421", "cites_id": ["9193437648693721421"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13164", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:TXkXI9WmlX8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
