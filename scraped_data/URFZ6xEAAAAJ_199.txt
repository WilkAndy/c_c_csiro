In a simulation study, we found that natural variability in year-to-year climate had a major effect on optimum N fertiliser rates for sugarcane in the Tully region of north-eastern Australia, where N discharges pose high risks to Great Barrier Reef ecosystems. There were interactions between climate and other factors affecting crop growth that made optimum N rates field-specific. The regional average optimum N fertiliser rate was substantially lower than current industry guidelines. Likewise, simulated N losses to the environment at optimum N fertiliser rates were substantially lower than the simulated losses at current industry fertiliser guidelines. Dissolved N discharged from rivers is related to fertiliser applications. If the reductions in N applications \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8418775548317159931", "cites_id": ["8418775548317159931"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X21006986", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-1EwscF_1XQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
