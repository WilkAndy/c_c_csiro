APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) is one such model that continues to be applied and adapted to this challenging research agenda. From its inception twenty years ago, APSIM has evolved into a framework containing many of the key models required to explore changes in agricultural landscapes with capability ranging from simulation of gene expression through to multi-field farms and beyond.Keating et al. (2003) described many of the fundamental attributes of APSIM in detail. Much has changed in the last decade, and the APSIM community has been exploring novel scientific domains and utilising software developments in social media, web and mobile applications to provide simulation tools \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC", "num_citations": 1419, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15392537955955688510", "cites_id": ["15392537955955688510"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815214002102", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PsR0wLdHndUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 18, "2015": 80, "2016": 111, "2017": 152, "2018": 133, "2019": 182, "2020": 202, "2021": 197, "2022": 230, "2023": 109}}
