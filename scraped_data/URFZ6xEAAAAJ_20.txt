Salinisation of floodplain soils, as a result of the changed hydrological management of the River Murray, appears to be a primary cause of the dieback. Regulation of the River Murray has reduced the frequency of large flood events by a factor of approximately three and caused groundwater levels beneath floodplains to rise. The higher water tables have resulted in increased discharge of the naturally saline groundwater in the floodplains by evapotranspiration, and the decreased incidence of large floods has reduced floodwater recharge and hence leaching of salt from floodplain soils. Use of soil physical properties for a range of floodplain soils, combined with measurements of groundwater discharge from bare and vegetated sites, suggests that the time-scale for complete soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC", "num_citations": 170, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=427449787870840613", "cites_id": ["427449787870840613"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002216949390127U", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:JYdbPVGb7gUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 1, "1994": 0, "1995": 2, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 7, "2001": 3, "2002": 5, "2003": 4, "2004": 5, "2005": 5, "2006": 4, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 12, "2010": 12, "2011": 6, "2012": 8, "2013": 13, "2014": 12, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 4, "2020": 6, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
