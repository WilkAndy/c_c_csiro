This paper reports initial results from an international collaborative effort to improve sugarcane models, particularly for predicting impacts of projected climate change. Data from 35 experiments conducted in seven countries were simulated with the APSIM-Sugar model, firstly \u2018blind\u2019, using only climate, soil and management data, then again with the addition of available phenology data from the experiments. Surprisingly, the addition of the phenology data resulted in only small improvements in overall predictions of stalk dry mass, although the improvement was substantial (12-30 t/ha) at several sites. The generally small improvement suggests that either there is not a lot of vital information in phenology data for prediction of final stalk dry mass of a sugarcane crop, or the APSIM-Sugar model is not overly sensitive to these parameters. Further work is required to resolve these issues."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10930759615602099961", "cites_id": ["10930759615602099961"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew-Jones-87/publication/269101478_Evaluation_of_the_APSIM-SUGAR_model_for_simulating_sugarcane_yield_at_sites_in_seven_countries_initial_results/links/56e66a8008ae65dd4cc17f13/Evaluation-of-the-APSIM-SUGAR-model-for-simulating-sugarcane-yield-at-sites-in-seven-countries-initial-results.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-QYm7fTbsZcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
