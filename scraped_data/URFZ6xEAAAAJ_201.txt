In this paper we examine these questions by analysing data from on-farm experiments testing the N Replacement system, which aims to have N applications aligned with actual cane production. In 11 experiments in one-year crops, yields in the N Replacement treatment were similar to those achieved with the farmers' conventional N management which had average N applications 18 to 157 kg/ha greater than in the N Replacement treatments. In four sites with two-year crops in NSW, N rates with N Replacement were similar to or greater than the farmer's current N applications. N concentrations and N uptake in cane in most experiments were considerably lower than those previously reported. This unexpectedly low N requirement explains why yields were maintained with the lower N applications in the N Replacement system. The lower N concentrations also meant that the crop N surplus was greater than expected. The results also show that it is not critical to accurately predict the yield of the coming crop in developing an N management strategy, provided N applications and production are matched in the longer term. We suggest that focusing on the minimum surplus needed to maintain productivity and soil N reserves may usefully guide future thinking on sustainable N fertiliser management."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14092861481914123941", "cites_id": ["14092861481914123941"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103180587", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:pcZGwtnmk8MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 0, "2012": 2, "2013": 1}}
