However, over application results in reduced profitability and sugar quality, and results in high concentrations of N in soils and water of sugarcane growing areas. An extensive review of current and past research on N fertiliser management in the Australian sugar industry was undertaken to identify possible improvements in N fertiliser management and establish priorities for future research into sustainable management of N fertiliser. The Australian sugar industry has a history of high N fertiliser usage, with applications increasing from the 1960s to the late 1990s. However, industry average sugarcane production has not kept pace with N fertiliser applications, resulting in a steady increase in N fertiliser applied per ton of sugarcane harvested. Historical and recently developed N management strategies rely on matching N applications to the predicted/expected yield of the forthcoming crop. Over-application of N fertiliser is a rational reaction by growers to uncertainty about the size of the coming crop and the long-term impact of N fertiliser on profitability \u2013 significant over-fertilisation reduces profits much less than significant under fertilisation. We suggest that past and current N fertiliser management strategies have not adequately accounted for these attitudes, and the resultant longer-term implications for soil and water quality and environmental impacts in sugarcane catchments. While long-term under application of N fertiliser undoubtedly reduces profitability, there is considerable evidence to show that greatly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:ODE9OILHJdcC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14079441498704046746", "cites_id": ["14079441498704046746"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13980", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:muolbnI5ZMMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 2}}
