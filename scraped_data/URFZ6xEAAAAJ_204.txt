Traditional disciplinary approaches are unable to provide integrated management solutions, and an approach based on whole systems analysis is essential to bring about beneficial change to industry and the community. The application of this approach to water management, nutrient management and cane supply management is outlined. The key learning has been the need for innovation both in the technical aspects of system function underpinned by modelling and in the process of implementation of changed practices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10966422645876140015", "cites_id": ["10966422645876140015"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20023165589", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7yc_OEuPMJgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
