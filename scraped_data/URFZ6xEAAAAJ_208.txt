However, skepticism and lack of trust in water quality science by farming stakeholders has emerged as a significant challenge. The ongoing failures of both compulsory and particularly voluntary practices to improve land management and reduce diffuse agricultural pollution from the Great Barrier Reef catchment underlines the need for more effective communication of water quality issues at appropriate decision-making scales to landholders. Using recent Great Barrier Reef catchment experiences as examples, we highlight several emerging themes and opportunities in using technology to better communicate land use-water quality impacts and delivery of actionable knowledge to farmers, specifically supporting decision-making, behavior \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5760133860921699747", "cites_id": ["5760133860921699747"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X21005683", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o-3vXjob8E8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 7}}
