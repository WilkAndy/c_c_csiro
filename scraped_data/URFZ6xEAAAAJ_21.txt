Since this fertiliser is a substantial input cost and has implications if N is lost to the environment, there are pressing needs to optimise the supply of N to the crops\u2019 requirements. The complexity of the N cycle and the strong influence of climate, through its moderation of N transformation processes in the soil and its impact on N uptake by crops, make simulation-based approaches to this N management problem attractive. In this paper we describe the processes to be captured in modelling soil and plant N dynamics in sugarcane systems, and review the capability for modelling these processes. We then illustrate insights gained into improved management of N through simulation-based studies for the issues of crop residue management, irrigation management \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC", "num_citations": 164, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14485335394836962450", "cites_id": ["14485335394836962450"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429005000407", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:klymhcs_BskJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 7, "2007": 7, "2008": 8, "2009": 6, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 8, "2013": 15, "2014": 11, "2015": 10, "2016": 10, "2017": 4, "2018": 10, "2019": 11, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
