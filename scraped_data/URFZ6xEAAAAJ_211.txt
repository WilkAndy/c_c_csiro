An earlier version of this Handbook was developed and used by several AgMIP Regional Research Teams (RRTs) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA)(AgMIP handbook version 4.2, www.agmip.org/regional-integrated-assessments-handbook/).  In contrast to the earlier version, which was written specifically to guide a consistent set of integrated assessments across SSA and SA, this version is intended to be more generic such that the methods can be applied to any region globally.  These assessments are the regional manifestation of research activities described by AgMIP in its online protocols document (available at www.agmip.org).  AgMIP Protocols were created to guide climate, crop modeling, economics, and information technology components of its projects."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9609055769727792169", "cites_id": ["9609055769727792169"], "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150022468", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KfSKxU85WoUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
