We used the well-validated APSIM model to examine potential agronomic benefits and long-term risks of this strategy under the current and warmer climates of the new region. Yield of the two crops, irrigation requirement, total soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were simulated. Sixteen climate stressors were used; these were generated by using global climate models ECHAM5, GFDL2.1, GFDL2.0 and MRIGCM232 with a median sensitivity under two Special Report of Emissions Scenarios over the 2030 and 2050 timeframes plus current climate (baseline) for Katherine. Effects were compared at three \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15362191809382636229", "cites_id": ["15362191809382636229"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/CP/CP15068", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xdqq6Q54MdUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 2}}
