This N use, together with the warm, wet environment in which it grows, produces a high potential for emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils. The few measurements of N2O emitted from sugarcane are higher than expected from the level of N applied or experience in other crops. Accordingly, we simulated long-term N2O emissions over a range of environments and sugarcane management practices. Simulations were undertaken with the cropping systems model, APSIM, after we (1) tested the denitrification sub-model and (2) added a mechanistic N2O prediction capability to the model. Predicted N2O emissions agreed well with data from two field experiments measured, provided the default value of the model's denitrification rate coefficient was substantially \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 163, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17852035802317109096", "cites_id": ["17852035802317109096"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880909003740", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aLeqYvorv_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 5, "2011": 10, "2012": 5, "2013": 12, "2014": 14, "2015": 14, "2016": 19, "2017": 17, "2018": 10, "2019": 13, "2020": 14, "2021": 7, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
