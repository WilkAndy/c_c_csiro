It is very likely that most of the global warming since the mid-20th century is due to increases in GHG from human activities (IPCC 2007). Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850). Regardless of the actions that we take today, some degree of global warming is inevitable so adaptation will be an essential risk management strategy (IPCC 2007). Expected shifts in annual average temperature between now and 2030 will be in the order 0.2 to 1.3 C in many of the Australian agricultural regions. By 2050, the projected increase in annual average temperature will be in the range of 0.4 to 2.6 C (CSIRO and BoM 2007). This range of warming values exists because of the range of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14376617117864831062", "cites_id": ["14376617117864831062"], "pub_url": "https://apo.org.au/node/20788", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VigiHhkBhMcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
