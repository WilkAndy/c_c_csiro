The Australian biofuels industry currently only supplies less than 0.5% of the total transport fuels (O\u2019Connell et al., 2007) using waste starch and C-Molasses for ethanol, and used vegetable oil and tallow for biodiesel. Expansion of biofuel supplies requires different feedstock sources because the supply of traditional feedstocks is reaching its limit. The sustainability of these new feedstocks needs to be assessed. GHG emissions of biofuels have long been of critical interest to policy makers as a key aspect of sustainability, and have been fundamental to the argument for government support.While the GHG emission profiles for a range of standard first generation biofuels have been well studied (O\u2019Connell et al., 2007), many of these \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3505586825497801208", "cites_id": ["3505586825497801208"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3505586825497801208&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-PEV96RYpjAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2}}
