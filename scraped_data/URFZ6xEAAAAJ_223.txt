The application of mill mud (130 t/ha) at one time during the crop cycle was predicted to significantly reduce the N fertilizer requirements of all sugarcane crops within the crop cycle. The reduced requirements for N fertilizer were simulated to occur when the mill mud had a relatively high C: N ratio. Field experiments were initiated in 2006 in Australia to verify these predictions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13418914622999713623", "cites_id": ["13418914622999713623"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083147713", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:V1cxz8CPOboJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
