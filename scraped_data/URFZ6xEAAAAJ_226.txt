The effects of tillage, stubble management, deep sowing and press wheel pressure on wheat establishment were examined at various periods after rain. Experiments were conducted on two contrasting soil types: an Entic Pellustert and a Typic Natrustalf. On the Entic Pellustert, both tillage during the fallow and the use of a press wheel at sowing increased wheat establishment. Responses to tillage and the press wheel occurred even when there was enough post-sowing rain to wet the soil to the level of seed placement. Increase in sowing depth from 67 to 88 mm reduced establishment in most sowings. On the Typic Natrustalf, there was little establishment response to tillage, a mulch of wheat stubble or the use of press wheel pressure at sowing.
