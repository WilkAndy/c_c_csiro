Wetting rate was varied by manipulating the energy of the water used to wet up the soil. Fast wetting was found to increase moisture uptake in Vertisols over a wide range of matric potentials (to -38 MPa in one soil). At high matric potentials, additional water uptake ranged up to 0.26 g g-l. These results were attributed to the creation of planar voids within soils between small water-stable aggregates on fast wetting. These voids retained water at matric potentials as low as -90 kPa. At this potential, 40% of additional water taken up on fast wetting was still retained in one soil. At -1500 kPa, fast wet soils retained up to 1.2 times more moisture relative to slow wet soils.
