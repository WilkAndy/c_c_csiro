Broad soil texture ranges (e.g. sand, loam, clay) are usually the only information related to soil wetting used in trickle system designs. In this study, dimensions of wetted soil were calculated from hydraulic properties of 29 soils covering a wide range of textures and soil hydraulic properties to assess the impact of soil texture and/or type on soil wetting patterns. The soils came from two groups that differed in the extent to which hydraulic properties depended on soil texture. Vertical and radial distances to the wetting front from both surface and buried emitters were calculated for conditions commonly associated with daily irrigation applications in a widely spaced row \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC", "num_citations": 155, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2674261912153766480", "cites_id": ["2674261912153766480"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00271-003-0077-3", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UDpITgrjHCUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 6, "2006": 7, "2007": 9, "2008": 4, "2009": 9, "2010": 18, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 10, "2015": 14, "2016": 10, "2017": 12, "2018": 4, "2019": 2, "2020": 13, "2021": 7, "2022": 9}}
