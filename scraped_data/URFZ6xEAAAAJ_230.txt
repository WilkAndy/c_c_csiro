The effects of the treatments on soil physical properties was determined at two times during the ninth year of the trial. This paper briefly reports the main results of these soil physical investigations, and highlights measurements in which greatest differences between treatments were found."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:ruyezt5ZtCIC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1746097388622738616", "cites_id": ["1746097388622738616"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1746097388622738616&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uHQY4FJiOxgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 0, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 0, "1997": 0, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 1, "2005": 1}}
