To meet the expected grain demand by mid-century, wheat breeding strategies must continue to improve upon yield-advancing physiological traits, regardless of climate change impacts. Here, the best performing doubled haploid (DH) crosses with an increased canopy photosynthesis from wheat field experiments in the literature were extrapolated to the global scale with a multi-model ensemble of process-based wheat crop models to estimate global wheat production. The DH field experiments were also used to determine a quantitative relationship between wheat production and solar radiation to estimate genetic yield potential. The multi-model ensemble projected a global annual wheat production of 1050\u00b1145 Mt due to the improved canopy photosynthesis, a 37% increase, without expanding cropping area. Achieving this genetic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:WwIwg2wKZ0QC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8892785518066485091", "cites_id": ["8892785518066485091"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aca77c/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Y0cXDFCFaXsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 5}}
