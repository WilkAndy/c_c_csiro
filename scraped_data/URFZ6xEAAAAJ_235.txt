Specifically, economic impacts of switching from urea to various CRF products are assessed by comparing:(1) average economic returns,(2) economic returns in good years, represented by highest returns with a cumulative probability (CVaR0 0.95), and (3) big losses in bad years, represented by lowest returns with a cumulative probability (CVaR 0.05) across alternative fertilisers. The risk framework is underpinned by a modelling approach that integrates agricultural production system simulation modelling (APSIM), probability theory, Monte Carlo simulation, financial-risk analysis techniques and threshold analysis. The analysis is carried out in a specific case study in the wet tropics, Queensland for One soil type and sugarcane management system as a first analysis to identify economic issues that may arise with adoption of CRFs. Results show that yield responses to fertiliser inputs are highly variable with variable climate. The potential for profitable adoption of CRFs is largely influenced by the relative cost of CRFs compared with the cost of urea. At equal cost, CRFs would likely realise higher average net returns and higher returns in both good and bad years than conventional fertilisers thereby improving the overall economic viability of agricultural enterprises. If, however, the cost of CRF was at least twice the cost of conventional fertilisers, adoption of CRFs would likely result in reduced average net returns and lower returns in bad years, thereby \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:nPT8s1NX_-sC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3301824726209522844", "cites_id": ["3301824726209522844"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20183005581", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nOxRPBhw0i0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
