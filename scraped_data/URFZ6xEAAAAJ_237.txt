It has high potassium (K) and organic matter concentration and so is widely applied to sugarcane as a fertiliser. It is usually applied at the standard concentration produced during ethanol manufacture. However, there is interest in concentrating vinasse to reduce its volume and hence the cost of transport to farms. Vinasse will affect soil nitrogen (N) reactions because it contains water and easily decomposable organic substances, both of which can stimulate soil microorganisms. Both water content and the nature of the organic compounds are changed during the evaporation process, thus standard concentration (SCV) and high concentration (HCV) vinasse may have different effects on soil N cycling. We investigated N dynamics of soils receiving vinasse in a laboratory incubation experiment under aerobic conditions. The soils were incubated in darkness at 26 C with three amounts of vinasse at two concentrations (SCV and HCV, produced by evaporation in the sugarcane mill). The samples were analysed after 7, 14, 28, 42, 70 and 98 days of incubation. In five of the six treatments, the concentration of NO 3--N increased in the incubated soils over time indicating that nitrification occurred in the treatments that received vinasse. The exception was with the highest amount of SCV, where there was accumulation of NH 4+-N and the content of NO 3--N remained low. The large amount of water applied to the soil with the high amount of SCV may have caused anoxic conditions which inhibited nitrification. The temporal trends in NO 3--N and NH 4+-N concentrations in the incubated soils \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:27LrP4qxOz0C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1212145786451987936", "cites_id": ["1212145786451987936"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193249751", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4A11qSto0hAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 0, "2022": 3}}
