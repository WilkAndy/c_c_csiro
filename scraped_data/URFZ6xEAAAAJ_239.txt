The emission profiles of biofuels are of critical interest as a key aspect of their sustainability and LCA has been successful in helping characterise these. However new technologies, increased understanding of the role of nitrous oxide emissions, novel feedstocks and an emerging capacity to understand variation in farming systems are pushing a need to revisit existing knowledge. Using LCA, variation was explored within and between regional wheat and sugar agricultural systems, resulting in differences in emissions of up to 87% in sugar production and 64% in wheat production. Combining LCA with an agricultural systems simulator allowed an investigation into model uncertainty due to the choice of emission factor in sugar systems, which were found to alter the results by up to 72%. Such analyses may prove useful in the rapid assessment of future biofuel feedstock emissions and help to accurately report on key sustainability parameters."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4114712265280599944", "cites_id": ["4114712265280599944"], "pub_url": "https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/8243#page=100", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iDf-LAFlGjkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
