Water uptake patterns were a function of the long-term availability of surface water. Trees with permanent access to a stream used some stream water at all times. However, water from soils or the water table commonly made up 50% of these trees' water. Trees beside an ephemeral stream had access to the stream 40\u201350% of the time (depending on the level of the stream). No more than 30% of the water they used was stream water when it was available. However, stream water use did not vary greatly whether the trees had access to the stream for 2 weeks or 10 months prior to sampling. Trees at the third site only had access to surface water during a flood. These trees did not change their uptake \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC", "num_citations": 154, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18178363302107308931", "cites_id": ["18178363302107308931"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00316957", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g2MaNByFRvwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1994": 1, "1995": 1, "1996": 1, "1997": 2, "1998": 1, "1999": 9, "2000": 2, "2001": 5, "2002": 6, "2003": 5, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 6, "2009": 5, "2010": 4, "2011": 12, "2012": 7, "2013": 8, "2014": 9, "2015": 5, "2016": 10, "2017": 6, "2018": 5, "2019": 7, "2020": 8, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
