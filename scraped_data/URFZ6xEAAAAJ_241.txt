The availability of N in trash is complicated because most of the N cycles through the soil organic matter. To gain insights into the impacts of trash management on sugarcane production and the long-term fate of N contained in trash, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model. Simulations were conducted over 100 years for three different soil types combined with climatic data from five locations from Bundaberg to Tully. Trash management and N fertiliser application rates were varied in the simulations. The simulation study showed that sugarcane yields have potential to respond positively to trash retention in the range of environments considered. However, achieving these higher potential yields will require that N application not be reduced following the switch from burning to conserving residues. The results of the simulations also indicate that average environmental losses of N are likely to be greater from trash conserving systems at all rates from N fertiliser applications and so particular care should be exercised to avoid over-application of N fertiliser. Simulation results also illustrate a potential negative, short-term impact of trash blanketing on sugarcane yields due to the immobilisation of N by the decomposing trash. Implications of this disequilibrium period on the results of short-term trash management trials and the transition from trash burning to conserving systems are discussed. The simulations undertaken in this study obviously have limitations, and these are discussed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5848347956315688483", "cites_id": ["5848347956315688483"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Thorburn/publication/237293105_Nitrogen_management_following_crop_residue_retention_in_sugarcane_production/links/0deec52cb6e9d4e653000000/Nitrogen-management-following-crop-residue-retention-in-sugarcane-production.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Iw4U-3qBKVEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 2}}
