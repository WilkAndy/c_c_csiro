Long term retention of residue is believed to improve soil fertility to the extent that nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications might be reduced by up to 40 kg N/ha/y. However, the fate of N in the extreme environment of the wet tropics is not known with certainty. Indices of potential N mineralisation and nitrification were developed and indicate that potential N fertility is greater in the wet tropics compared to more southern cane growing areas, and is enhanced under residue retention. Field results from the wet tropics support this prediction, but indicate high soil ammonium-N concentrations relative to nitrate-N."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15300502371191311938", "cites_id": ["15300502371191311938"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2003/c/5/meier.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qk7hT9dNVtQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
