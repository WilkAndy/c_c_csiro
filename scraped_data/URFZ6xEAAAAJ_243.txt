Dimensions of soil wetting patterns around drip emitters were calculated from the hydraulic properties of two groups of soils. The groups differed in the extent to which hydraulic properties depended on soil texture. Wetted dimensions were determined for conditions commonly associated with daily irrigation applications in a widely spaced row crop (sugarcane) and horticultural crops. The study showed that texture is an unreliable predictor of wetting, and that site-specific information is required on soil wetting or hydraulic properties, to design efficient trickle irrigation systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16874422634737205881", "cites_id": ["16874422634737205881"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013065747", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:eYJSVfv9LeoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 1, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
