Better information on uptake from shallow water tables is required to devise improved irrigation management strategies which prevents the unnecessary leaching that causes water tables to rise. This study assessed the sensitivity of a numerical Richards\u2019 equation-based model to variations in values of input parameters, to better understand the limitations of such models for assessing irrigation management strategies in the presence of shallow water tables. Three soils (clay loam, light clay and clay) were used in the simulations. Water table depths were set at 1.2 m and two different water application regimes (14 or 28 mm applied on the first day of the week) were simulated. The simulations were run over 24 weeks to represent periods prior to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9049598091410119505", "cites_id": ["9049598091410119505"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-6141-5_5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:UZuNboShln0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 0, "2000": 0, "2001": 2, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 2}}
