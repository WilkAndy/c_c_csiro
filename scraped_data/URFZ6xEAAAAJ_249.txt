Reef and Rainforest Research Centre Limited, Cairns (67pp.)", "abstract": "The health of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is under pressure from discharge of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The main source of DIN is nitrogen (N) fertilisers applied to sugarcane cropping, with DIN discharges correlated to N fertiliser application rates at all scales, from the field to the basin (Brodie et al., 2013; Waterhouse et al., 2017). Thus, the primary and most well proven path to reducing DIN impacts on the GBR is to have farmers reduce N fertiliser application rates to sugarcane crops (Thorburn and Wilkinson, 2013); currently other approaches are secondary to this goal.The Queensland and Australian governments have recognised the need for farmers to reduce N fertiliser applications to sugarcane crops and since 2008 have put in place two broad-scale activities to effect that change (Kroon et al 2016):(1) regulation of N application rates to be at least equal to industry support recommendations (The State of Queensland 2019), and (2) providing grants to facilitate voluntary adoption of improved practice. However, after more than 10 years of these measures many farmers still apply N fertiliser at above-regulated rates, as shown by successive Report Cards (Australian and Queensland Governments 2019). This lack of success is, perhaps, not unexpected. Compliance with regulations to control distributed source pollution is difficult and expensive to enforce (Kroon et al 2016). Further, regulations represent a \u201cminimum standard\u201d and rates will need to be reduced below those in order to achieve water quality targets (Brodie et al., 2013; Waterhouse et al., 2017). Internationally, the history of success with voluntary reductions of N fertiliser \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:TaaCk18tZOkC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13959291407695373703", "cites_id": ["13959291407695373703"], "pub_url": "https://nesptropical.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NESP-TWQ-Project-3.1.8-Final-Report.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:h2XYZ5NducEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
