A methodological framework and software are presented to evaluate and classify data sets into four classes regarding their suitability for different modelling purposes. Weighting of inputs and variables for testing was set from the aspect of crop modelling. The software allows users to adjust weights according to their specific requirements. Background information is given for the variables with respect to their relevance for modelling and possible uncertainties. Examples are given for data sets of the different classes. The framework helps to assemble high quality data bases, to select data from data bases according to modellers requirements and gives guidelines to experimentalists for experimental design and decide on the most effective \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 146, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14173526799167258684", "cites_id": ["14173526799167258684"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215001565", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:PADYfod7ssQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 4, "2016": 15, "2017": 21, "2018": 25, "2019": 17, "2020": 22, "2021": 17, "2022": 16, "2023": 8}}
