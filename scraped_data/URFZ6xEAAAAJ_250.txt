To facilitate the intercomparison and improvement of process-based models and the exchange of model components, several groups in the field joined to create the Agricultural Model Exchange Initiative (AMEI). Agricultural Model Exchange Initiative proposes a centralized framework for exchanging and reusing model components. It provides a modular and declarative approach to describe the specification of unit models and their composition. A model algorithm is associated with each model specification, which implements its mathematical behaviour. This paper focuses on the expression of the model algorithm \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hQUaER0FWQ4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2780803004332130379", "cites_id": ["2780803004332130379"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/insilicoplants/article-abstract/2/1/diaa007/5918454", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:S0COX5lllyYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2, "2023": 1}}
