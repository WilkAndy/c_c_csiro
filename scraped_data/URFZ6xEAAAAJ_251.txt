In order to identify optimal nitrogen application rates throughout the Tully mill area, it is important to identify sub-regions that share similar topographical, soil, farm management, productivity or climatological attributes. While current SIX EASY STEPS nitrogen guidelines enable a hierarchy of district, soil, block and crop nitrogen requirements for sugarcane, it would be beneficial for management zones to also take spatial climate variability information into account. Unfortunately, spatial climate variability within a region, is generally not considered when developing nitrogen management practices. The objective of this paper was to identify sub-regions within the Tully mill area based on climatological attributes as a first step towards better informing nitrogen management decisions. Rainfall, radiation and temperature data were obtained on a 0.05 by 0.05\u02da grid (approximately 5 km by 5 km) for sugarcane-growing areas within the Tully Mill region. A K-means clustering algorithm was then used to cluster these grid cells into distinct sub-regions based on seasonal or annual climate data. Two distinct sub-regions were identified based on total annual rainfall and annual average daily radiation data. These sub-regions were identified as a northern and southern sub-region, divided roughly along the Tully River. The northern sub-region was characterised by lower radiation, lower temperatures and higher rainfall than the southern sub-region. Crop simulation models will now be able to use this knowledge to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5266813701163635027", "cites_id": ["5266813701163635027"], "pub_url": "http://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/48862", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U9EEDCh7F0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
