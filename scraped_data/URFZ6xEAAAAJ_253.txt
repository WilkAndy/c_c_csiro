Increased SOC can benefit crop growth by influencing soil processes and functions such as mineral nitrogen (N) supply to crops through its effect on N cycling, and water supply to crops through its effect on soil water characteristics. However, the relative contribution of these soil processes to grain yield is poorly understood. Crop models are increasingly used to investigate farming system productivity. Using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model, we investigated the effect of particular soil processes, as affected by increased SOC in the top 0.1 m of the soil, on grain production for three Australian farming sites. At each site, we simulated wheat yield in scenarios where increased SOC was manipulated in the model to affect:(1) N cycling (ie N supply);(2) soil water characteristics (ie water supply); or (3) the combined effect of N cycling and soil water characteristics. Scenarios were simulated across five N fertiliser rates. We found that at low fertiliser rates, the effect of increased SOC on N cycling significantly increased simulated wheat yields. There was no similar effect at high fertiliser rates. The effect of increased SOC on soil water characteristics was much smaller than that on N cycling, but higher SOC increased crop yield at two of the three sites at high fertiliser rates. Quantitative estimates of the effect of increased SOC on crop yield are important in the context of managing SOC in Australian grains farms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:jFemdcug13IC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1649672856541987573", "cites_id": ["1649672856541987573"], "pub_url": "https://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2015_Conference/pdf/agronomy2015final00375.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9QLKAbnQ5BYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 1}}
