There are several major limitations that must be overcome to achieve this goal, including the need to train AgMIP regional research team (RRT) crop modelers to use models other than the ones they are currently familiar with, plus the need to harmonize and interconvert the disparate input file formats used for the various models. Two activities were followed to address these shortcomings among AgMIP RRTs to enable them to use multiple models to evaluate climate impacts on crop production and food security. We designed and conducted courses in which participants trained on two different sets of crop models, with emphasis on the model of least experience. In a second activity, the AgMIP IT group created templates for inputting data on soils, management, weather, and crops into AgMIP harmonized databases, and developed translation tools for converting the harmonized data into files that are ready for multiple crop model simulations. The strategies for creating and conducting the multi-model course and developing entry and translation tools are reviewed in this chapter."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17428805267242629111", "cites_id": ["17428805267242629111"], "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20150010248", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9zd0fQyO3_EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 1}}
