They are increasingly applied to problems of both a short-term (eg farm performance, crop production monitoring) and long-term (eg climate change issues, food security, environmental policy) nature. In 2003, a special issue of the European Journal of Agronomy (van Ittersum and Donatelli, 2003) entitled \u2018Modelling Cropping Systems\u2019 summarized the state of the art in the field. Since that special issue, the challenges facing agricultural models have changed significantly. Global food security and climate change are large external drivers, and the production context is more complex, largely because of the greater demands from the natural resource management aspects of agricultural systems. This has driven many developments in improving agricultural systems models, their implementation as software programs, their inter-comparison in ensemble modelling, and their integration into larger frameworks. Most of these issues are generic and are relevant to other areas of environmental modelling and software. In the past decade, methodological issues related to integrated environmental modelling (Laniak et al., 2013), model performance (Bennett et al., 2013) and model uncertainty (Refsgaard et al., 2007) have also become of great relevance to agricultural modelling and software. With this Thematic Issue we aim to capture the methodological, technical and application advances in agricultural systems modelling and software, to reflect on the drivers of change, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3966885589750139043", "cites_id": ["3966885589750139043"], "pub_url": "http://www.athanasiadis.info/assets/pdf/envsoft2014agri.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o0isKW01DTcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 0, "2022": 1}}
