Scientists have attempted to make agricultural systems science more accessible and useful for industry stakeholders through decision-support systems (DSSs). However, the poor uptake of agricultural DSSs by intended users has lead to critical reflection on the way in which these technologies are developed and applied. The current shift towards participatory research, development and application approaches recognises the benefits of fostering collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships between scientists and their stakeholders, but lacks a detailed analysis of the interaction between the multiple parties involved in DSS application. To address this gap, we have analysed the participatory application of DSSs, using concepts from science and technology studies, through a project examining the application of knowledge intensive technologies in the Australian sugar industry.In this chapter, we outline a theoretical framework for understanding the role of technologies in interactions between scientists and practice communities. The framework focuses on the phases of participatory DSS application, and the likely outcomes of this process. The framework is based on three concepts from science and technology studies: namely interpretative flexibility, technological frames and boundary objects. We reflect on how this framework contributes to understanding the challenges and benefits of integrated, mission-directed research, including the challenges of problem definition and role definition and the potential benefit of generating new"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11594164364749724924", "cites_id": ["11594164364749724924"], "pub_url": "https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=E18pZIBeigEC&oi=fnd&pg=PT107&dq=info:_FxmrA-_5qAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=iLDr9cuo2U&sig=xzLZ60SEOY9Tzer3cPKPAUlj4tU", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_FxmrA-_5qAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 1}}
