Five different rates of N fertilizers were applied, including a treatment with no N applied. Despite the relative simplicity of this technique, it can provide valuable information on the outcomes and sustainability of different N fertilizer application management practices, and help to develop more sustainable N fertilizer management system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1141625623693796874", "cites_id": ["1141625623693796874"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083147707", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:CqbAxnTe1w8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
