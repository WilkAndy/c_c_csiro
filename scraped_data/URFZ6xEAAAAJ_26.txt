Eucalyptus camaldulensis is often used for this purpose due to its salt tolerance and ability to use groundwater. Salt tolerance studies suggest that Casuarina glauca would also have groundwater management potential, however, little is known about its transpiration and groundwater uptake properties. A combination of stable isotope (2H  and 18O ) techniques and sapflow measurements were used to determine groundwater discharge by both species at three saline sites. This included the use of a three-layer model for determining the proportions of water utilised from various soil depths. At one site, groundwater was the dominant water source for C. glauca in over 70% of sampling times. However, at a higher rainfall site, groundwater was the major water source for this species in only 40 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC", "num_citations": 145, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8880919526457314112", "cites_id": ["8880919526457314112"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837749800078X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:QItRlUFdP3sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 2, "2001": 4, "2002": 5, "2003": 6, "2004": 7, "2005": 7, "2006": 4, "2007": 2, "2008": 4, "2009": 4, "2010": 7, "2011": 8, "2012": 3, "2013": 6, "2014": 7, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 9, "2019": 6, "2020": 11, "2021": 3, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
