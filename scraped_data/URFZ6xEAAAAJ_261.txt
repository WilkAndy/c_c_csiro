It also details Acceptable Solutions to satisfy the Performance Requirements. It this paper we analyse the links between science and action to determine whether the legislation and associated policy are likely to lead to sound management decisions being made for prevention of land and water salinity. We also compared the requirements for biodiversity protection relative to those for salinity control. For salinity (and biodiversity) the minimum standards and Acceptable Solutions in the legislation have a sound technical basis. The main challenge in implementing the salinity Performance Requirements will be provision of information \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3880299242534232782", "cites_id": ["3880299242534232782"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/rj/RJ02007", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zmJ4NZqX2TUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 1, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 1, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 1}}
