APSIM\u2019s linking of crop growth with soil water and N/C dynamics makes it particularly suited for extrapolating the results of agronomic experiments to different soil, management and/or climatic conditions (Probert et al., 1995, 1998b; McCown et al., 1996; Keating et al., 1997). Despite its wide application for this purpose, to date some APSIM modules have been developed and tested in grain and legumes systems in semiarid, rain-fed areas (Probert et al., 1995, 1998a, b; Carberry et al., 1996) and so could benefit from wider testing. This is particularly so of the APSIM-Residue module that describes \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:BUYA1_V_uYcC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=378518648961119714", "cites_id": ["378518648961119714"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1079/9780851994659.0000#page=95", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4jUwrLTEQAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 0, "2002": 0, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 1}}
