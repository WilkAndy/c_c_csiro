The environment (e.g., soils and climate) and management influence agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the potential to reduce emissions. For agriculture to contribute to greenhouse gas abatement in the long term, it is important to identify low-cost mitigation actions that farmers can adopt. It is hypothesized that greenhouse gas abatement potential and the associated costs will differ substantially between environments in Australia. Seven alternative management scenarios were identified as both suitable for adoption across different grain growing environments in Australia and potentially able to provide greenhouse gas abatement. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator was used to simulate these alternative management scenarios over a 25-year period and analyze the potential for Australian grain farmers \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:DBa1UEJaJKAC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6170951851252384471", "cites_id": ["6170951851252384471"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-017-0438-6", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1wLwewOgo1UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
