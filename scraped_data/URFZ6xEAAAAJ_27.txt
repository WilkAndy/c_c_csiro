In sugar, such research has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, and has been motivated by low world sugar prices and rising costs of production. In this paper, we highlight the future opportunities in value chain research to achieve more profitable and sustainable sugar industries in different countries. We do this by: (a) conducting an extensive review of value chain research in sugar; (b) assessing the change resulting from chain research using case studies in the Australian and South African sugar industries; highlighting challenges to value chain research; and (c) considering opportunities and methodologies used in other industries. The paper makes several conclusions and recommendations. In particular we show that value chain opportunities \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC", "num_citations": 142, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3507360493157255606", "cites_id": ["3507360493157255606"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X0700042X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tongJcmlrDAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 2, "2008": 5, "2009": 8, "2010": 10, "2011": 7, "2012": 6, "2013": 12, "2014": 17, "2015": 10, "2016": 8, "2017": 7, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 7, "2021": 8, "2022": 6, "2023": 3}}
