To determine the probable magnitude on future world wheat production, three independent methods of estimation were utilized. Previously, however, the high temperature aspects of an ensemble of physiological-process-based wheat growth models had been tested using field data obtained over a very wide range of temperatures in Arizona by ARS researchers and a University of Arizona collaborator at Maricopa, Arizona, as well as on some other datasets from other parts of the world. One method of estimation used the model ensemble on a grid over major wheat producing areas. A second used the ensemble at points where good weather and soils data were available and then assigned representative areas to each point. The third method used county-based historical wheat yield and weather data in a statistical model. Projected temperature impacts from the three methods were similar for major wheat producing areas, which gives credence to all three methods. Yields are projected to decrease 4.5% to 6.0% per 1.0 C rise in global temperature. This research will benefit all consumers of food and fiber.Technical Abstract: The potential impact of global temperature change on global wheat production has recently been assessed with different methods, scaling and aggregation approaches. Here we show that grid-based simulations, point-based simulations, and statistical regressions produce similar estimates of temperature impact on wheat yields at global and national scales.
