Crop models make it possible to generalise experimental results to new conditions, compare strategies, and also predict plant growth and production. However, they have an important drawback: the models are only approximations of reality and so there is uncertainty in their predictions. Crop model comparisons have been used to address this uncertainty. Comprehensive datasets that would allow model comparisons are scarce and, in most cases have already been utilised in model development and/or refinement. Independent field datasets would be useful to compare model performance in simulating plant processes (eg phenology, biomass partitioning, water use and stress) In addition, differences in stalk fresh mass (SFM) predictions between models could be used as an indication of simulation uncertainty. This study evaluated the performance of DSSAT-Canegro (DC) and APSIM-Sugarcane (AS) models as SFM predictors using data from six field experiments using the cultivar RB86-7515 in Coruripe-AL, Uni\u00e3o-PI, Aparecida do Taboado-MS, Colina-SP and Olimpia-SP, Brazil. This cultivar was selected as it accounts for nearly 30%(or 3 Mha) of Brazil's sugarcane area. Cultivar parameters were determined by qualitative fitting to minimise the root mean square error (RMSE) for SFM and leaf area index (LAI). Both models had phenology, canopy structure, and partitioning parameters modified from their respective standard cultivars (NCo376 for DC and Q117 for AS).
