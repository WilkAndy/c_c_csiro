Yet, not all emissions are this large and the reason for the wide range is unclear. The highest emissions come from a site with acid sulfate soils in Australia, and chemo-denitrification in the acid subsoils has been suggested as an important cause of the high emissions. However, emissions from acid sulfate soils are not always at the upper end of the range suggesting this explanation is not general. We used the APSIM model to investigate the degree to which the biological nitrous oxide-generating pathways represented in the model might (1) account for the high emissions measured in some sugarcane crops grown on acid sulfate soils, and hence (2) provide a broader understanding of the basis for the wide range of emissions associated with sugarcane. We found conditions at the site where the highest emissions were measured, particularly a combination of high soil organic carbon (\u223c 10%) and large applications of nitrogen fertiliser, gave simulated emissions similar to the high values measured. Sensitivity analyses showed that when soil carbon contents and/or nitrogen applications were lower, predicted emissions reduced to levels closer to those at other sites. Our results suggest that biological pathways are capable of producing the range of nitrous oxide emissions measured in sugarcane crops, and that the contribution of chemical pathways may not be great. The results have important implications for understanding both how nitrous oxide emissions from sugarcane may vary between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:X9ykpCP0fEIC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3784833135125052909", "cites_id": ["3784833135125052909"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193249752", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7b1B-a5thjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 1}}
