In this paper we report testing of a new concept for N management in sugarcane, the N Replacement system. This system aligns N applications with actual cane production, rather than potential production, by relying on soil N reserves to buffer differences in crop N needs and N fertiliser supply in individual crops. In 11 experiments that were conducted over an average of three crops, yields in the N Replacement treatment were similar to those achieved with the farmers\u2019 conventional N management that had average N applications 18 to 157 kg/ha/crop greater than in the N Replacement treatments. The crop N surplus, an estimate of N potentially lost to the environment, was ~40% lower in the N replacement treatments compared with conventional N management. N concentrations and N uptake in cane for most crops were lower than those previously reported. These low N concentrations may be a response to the lower N application, and explain why yields were maintained in the N Replacement system at the lower N rates. The results show that the ecologically-based N Replacement system may deliver superior environmental outcomes without significantly reducing production. The results also show that predicting yield of the coming crop, a common basis for N management, is not necessary in sugarcane N management, provided N applications and production are matched in the longer term."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10699414251022050003", "cites_id": ["10699414251022050003"], "pub_url": "https://escholarship.org/uc/item/70b7h5fc", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0-LryJL0e5QJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 2}}
