For trickle systems to operate efficiently, the two variables most easily manipulated when designing systems, the distance between emitters and emitter flow rates, must be matched to both the soil's wetting characteristics and the amount and timing of water to be supplied to the crop. This principle is rarely adopted during system design, possibly because most practitioners do not realize the variability in wetting patterns amongst different soils. To illustrate this variability, an analysis of wetting patterns was undertaken based on hydraulic properties of a wide range of soils from the Bundaberg area in Queensland, a region area with large areas of trickle-irrigated small crops. There was a wide range of wetting patterns in these soils, but there was no relationship \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15793824053490234654", "cites_id": ["15793824053490234654"], "pub_url": "https://www.actahort.org/books/792/792_80.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HjVOIUzvLtsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
