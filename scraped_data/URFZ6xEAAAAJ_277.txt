In particular, this paper introduces three sociological concepts that are useful for analysing new and complex technologies: interpretive flexibility, technological frames and boundary objects. Each of these concepts provides an interesting perspective on the social factors that influence the design and implementation of DSSs. This paper highlights the importance of the relationship between researchers and stakeholders and the complexity of the socio-technical system within which DSSs for farm management are developed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:geHnlv5EZngC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5018713991263409051", "cites_id": ["5018713991263409051"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2004/poster/4/1/1/1219_jakkues.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:m9OJ5sgNpkUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2}}
