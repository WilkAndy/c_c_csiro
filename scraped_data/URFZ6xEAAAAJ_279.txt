Wetting patterns were calculated from hydraulic properties of two groups of soils, covering a wide range of textures and soil hydraulic properties. The groups differed in the degree of field structure that was retained in the soils. The hydraulic properties of each of the soils in the first group were actually the mean of up to 400 samples that had been sieved before their hydraulic properties were determined. The second group consisted of 18 soils from Bundaberg (Queensland, Australia), that had their hydraulic properties determined either in the field or on intact cores, so retained the effects of field structure. Wetting patterns were determined for conditions commonly associated with daily irrigation applications. In the first group, the wetted radius increased and depth of wetting below the emitter decreased with increasing clay, as is commonly accepted. In the second group however, there was no such relationship between wetting patterns and texture. For example, four soils with the same classification and texture had as great a variation in wetting pattern as did all 11 soils in the first group, indicating the considerable impact of field structure on wetting patterns. Thus soil type and/or texture are unreliable predictors of wetting patterns, and there is no justification for having different emitter spacings in different soil textures. The results also suggest that (1) emitter spacings in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18277877952931933832", "cites_id": ["18277877952931933832"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001912602", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:iK5zaCgRqP0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 0, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
