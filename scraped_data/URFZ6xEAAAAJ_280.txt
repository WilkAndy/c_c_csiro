The experimental rate spanned the recommended rate for conventional irrigation schemes (160 N Kg/ha/year). In the treatments where N was applied between 260 and 600 Kg/ha of applied N were lost. The losses increased linearly with increasing applied N. However N sources other than applied fertilizer would have accounted for much of the lost N. At application rates of 80-120 N Kg/ha/year, losses of fertilizer-derived N were minimal. Additionally, cane yields at these application rates were not significantly lower than in treatments receiving more N. The experiment has shown that productivity can be maintained and N losses to the environment can be minimized in fertigated sugarcane-a 25-50% reduction in N fertilizer compared to conventional systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1837367944311755824", "cites_id": ["1837367944311755824"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013065699", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MFRkGmmkfxkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 0, "2004": 0, "2005": 0, "2006": 0, "2007": 0, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 0, "2012": 1}}
