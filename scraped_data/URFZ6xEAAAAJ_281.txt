Tree clearing has led to increased watertable recharge in lower parts of catchment areas, with local factors such as soil type, local geology, topography and land use affecting the extent of the salinity problem. These discharge areas often occur on small farms, where they can have a significant effect on farm productivity, and large environmental consequences in relation to farm size. This project aimed to determine the most effective management strategy to increase saline watertable discharge (salt-tolerant trees, salttolerant pastures, or bare soil) and to determine the physiological responses of trees to saline soil conditions and high water tables.Tree water sources and transpiration rates were determined for Casuarina glauca and Eucalyptus \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:eI34FqJmdUoC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5265548088493202060", "cites_id": ["5265548088493202060"], "pub_url": "https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/publications/99-036.pdf#page=52", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jNpfohb8EkkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1}}
