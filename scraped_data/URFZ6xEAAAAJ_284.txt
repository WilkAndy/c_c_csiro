However, field experiments evaluating yield and nitrogen loss benefits from enhanced-efficiency fertilizers often fail to obtain statistically significant treatment differences. Agricultural systems modeling provides a means to perform thousands of virtual response trials, allowing us to unravel the complex interactions between crop, management, and seasonal climate that determine the efficacy of these fertilizers. Here, we present simulations of controlled-release fertilizer use in Australian sugarcane (Saccharum sp. L.) production in a wet tropical climate. To quantify the agronomic and environmental benefits, we analyze the yield and nitrogen loss responses to nitrogen rate (response curves), comparing those for urea and controlled-release fertilizers. We also evaluate the impacts of soil type, crop start \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hNSvKAmkeYkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16933240854808300416", "cites_id": ["16933240854808300416"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-022-00807-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gAv7Xtf0_uoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
