Simply stated, crop models have been developed by different modeling teams and are different in structure and parameterization. This causes the models to have somewhat different growth, development, and yield responses to given weather, management, and soil conditions.In the AgMIP Regional Integrated Assessment (RIA) project, resources have limited us to using only two crop model systems: the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). Our goal in this chapter is to identify and understand the differences between the APSIM and DSSAT models for maize, wheat, rice, sorghum, millet, and peanut for their responses to CO2, temperature, water, and N fertilization (CTWN). Comparison of crop system responses to these fundamental factors has proven productive for applications across a number of scales and AgMIP activities"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:OzeSX8-yOCQC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11690843897765971643", "cites_id": ["11690843897765971643"], "pub_url": "https://agritrop.cirad.fr/604526/1/ID604526.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u0bikpU4PqIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
