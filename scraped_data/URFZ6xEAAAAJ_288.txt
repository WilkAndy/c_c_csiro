Proceedings of the 2019 Agronomy Australia Conference, Wagga Wagga", "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) losses from sugarcane production need to be reduced to help protect the health of the Great Barrier Reef. This challenge comes at a time when digital technologies are becoming more accessible and thus can be harnessed to improve N fertiliser management. We are developing \u2018apps\u2019 and advanced analytics to provide farmers with high quality information on:(1) water quality in their local creeks and rivers;(2) the magnitude of risk to production posed by lower N fertiliser rates; and (3) the abatement of N loss associated with those lower N rates, to help farmers potentially access payments from environmental schemes. We are also developing new ways of remotely sensing sugarcane crops so farmers can evaluate better the impacts of changed management on crop performance. This information will facilitate improved agronomic management leading to reduced impacts on the Great Barrier Reef."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:c1e4I3QdEKYC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16672010563549510888", "cites_id": ["16672010563549510888"], "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2019/2019ASA_Thorburn_Peter_268.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6Lztg0bhXucJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
