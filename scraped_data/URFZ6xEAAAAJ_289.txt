The widespread use of in-situ high-frequency monitoring instrumentation enables a better characterisation of water quality processes, leading to more meaningful decision making. The large amount of data collected by the high-frequency sensors creates new opportunities for machine learning methods to better understand data-intensive processes in aquatic ecosystems and improve data streams coming from sensors.CSIRO\u2019s DigiscapeGBR project aims to help protect the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) by enabling upstream sugarcane growers to make better nitrogen fertiliser management decisions, supporting water quality improvements which are critical to meet ecological targets for protecting the health of the Reef\u2019s ecosystems. Current studies based on machine learning in the DigicapeGBR project to improve data and predict future water quality are mainly focused on the following:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:qE4H1tSSYIIC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8001070918087961447", "cites_id": ["8001070918087961447"], "pub_url": "https://www.ivivan.com/papers/MODSIM2019.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z2tXx5uDCW8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
