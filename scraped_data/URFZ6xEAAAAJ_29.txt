This study determined the dynamics of off-site paddock-scale pesticide movement and subsequent concentrations in local receiving environments in fully irrigated sugarcane farming systems of the lower Burdekin floodplain region, the largest sugar producing area in Australia. Chemical movement (both mass and concentration) in paddock surface run-off followed a similar pattern across sites in the region for several of the commonly applied herbicides such as diuron, atrazine and ametryn. Highest losses (loads and event concentrations) occurred in the first irrigation run-off events following application, with subsequent irrigation losses tailing off rapidly. Significant losses could also occur during wet season \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC", "num_citations": 133, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18299907238708668693", "cites_id": ["18299907238708668693"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911002106", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:FWnUMa1U9v0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 3, "2013": 10, "2014": 12, "2015": 13, "2016": 19, "2017": 16, "2018": 13, "2019": 16, "2020": 12, "2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 1}}
