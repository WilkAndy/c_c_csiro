It is the module currently included in the general release of APSIM, although other wheat modules have been programmed in the APSIM simulation environment. APSIM-\u2010Wheat has developed from a combination of approaches used in previous APSIM wheat models (Meinke et al. 1997a, 1997b; Asseng et al. 1998a, 1998b; Wang et al. 2003b). The current version of the model is implemented within the APSIM-\u2010Plant model framework (Wang et al. 2003a), a generic crop template for developing crop models in APSIM.In APSIM-\u2010Wheat, temperature directly affects phenology, biomass accumulation, and root extension, and has indirect effects on transpiration efficiency and the influence of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on growth. There are other processes in farming systems affected by temperature (eg the nitrogen cycle \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1542582118474906486", "cites_id": ["1542582118474906486"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1542582118474906486&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dvuQiENaaBUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
