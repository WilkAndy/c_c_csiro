To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sugarcane production, and so increase the crop\u2019s attractiveness as a sustainable biofuel, it will be important to have a better understanding of nitrous oxide emissions and how they can be reduced. However, few measurements of nitrous oxide losses have been reported so far. Thus, our knowledge about nitrous oxide emissions from sugarcane production systems, and how they might vary in response to different environmental and management conditions, is limited. We compared measurements of nitrous oxide emissions with predictions from the cropping system model APSIM. We then simulated whole-of-crop nitrous oxide emissions over a range of environments and management practices in Australia. Predictions of nitrous oxide emissions were consistent with the measurements available, and greater than those from other intensive crops. Nitrous oxide emissions were predicted to vary considerably between regions, and were higher on irrigated soils and increased when trash was retained. Also, as expected, emissions were related to N fertiliser applications. Adoption of recent recommendations for reducing N fertiliser use was, in an example, predicted to reduce emissions by 40%. Further reductions in N applications and emissions, which may occur if emission trading schemes are adopted and fertiliser prices increase, were shown to reduce both emissions and profitability of sugarcane production. However, the economic value of reduced emissions is likely to be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12351978816195025632", "cites_id": ["12351978816195025632"], "pub_url": "https://atamexico.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AGRONOMY-27-Thorburn.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4Fp0LEoLa6sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2}}
