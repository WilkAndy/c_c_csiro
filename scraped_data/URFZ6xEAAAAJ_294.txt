Water and N lost in runoff were measured in the Delta and Mulgrave districts and in the deep drainage in Mona Park. These results provide additional information on N losses from Burdekin farms and suggest that there are opportunities for reducing N losses that could lead to enhanced profitability and sustainability in sugarcane farming. The results are also being used in the assessment of the regional impacts of sugarcane on the environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5070971953433993686", "cites_id": ["5070971953433993686"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083147705", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1uFm3h-2X0YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 1}}
