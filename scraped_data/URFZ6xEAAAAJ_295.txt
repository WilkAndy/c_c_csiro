This complexity has led to a search for ways in which scientific knowledge can be incorporated into forms that industry stakeholders can use to assist their management decisions. Decision support systems (DSSs) are one of the ways in which scientists have attempted to make agricultural systems science more accessible and useful for industry stakeholders. Recently, there has been a shift towards more participatory processes in development and application of DSSs. We have analysed these processes using concepts from the sociology of science and technology, and developed a framework for describing the phases of this participatory process and its likely outcomes. Understanding these phases may provide greater certainty that the process will result in the desired productive relationships and mutual understanding. We identify three outcomes of participatory DSS development. Firstly, interactions around DSSs may lead to practice change, resulting from greater capacity built amongst participants during the interactions; however the DSS itself may not be subsequently used. Secondly, DSSs may be used by industry stakeholders on an ongoing basis to improve practice. Thirdly, the interactions may support current management practices and the DSS provides little additional benefit. We propose that participatory DSS development and/or application should be viewed as a learning process leading to knowledge acquisition, rather than a software development process. We illustrate these concepts with a case study from \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16064299445129007039", "cites_id": ["16064299445129007039"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2008/concurrent/achieving-change/5853_thorburnpj.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:v09rqDvb794J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 2}}
