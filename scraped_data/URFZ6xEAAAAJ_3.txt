Uncertainty is often quantified when projecting future greenhouse gas emissions and their influence on climate. However, multi-model uncertainty analysis of crop responses to climate change is rare because systematic and objective comparisons among process-based crop simulation models, are difficult. Here we present the largest standardized model intercomparison for climate change impacts so far. We found that individual crop models are able to simulate measured wheat grain yields accurately under a range of environments, particularly if the input information is sufficient. However, simulated climate change impacts vary across models owing to differences in model structures and parameter values. A greater proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections was due to variations among crop models than to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC", "num_citations": 1217, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16483758177537798534", "cites_id": ["16483758177537798534"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1916", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hrGUT7oSwuQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 17, "2014": 73, "2015": 159, "2016": 104, "2017": 159, "2018": 153, "2019": 123, "2020": 125, "2021": 120, "2022": 132, "2023": 39}}
