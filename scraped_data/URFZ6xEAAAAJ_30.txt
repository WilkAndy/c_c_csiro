One example of these consequences is the effect of agricultural pollutants on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), a world heritage-listed ecosystem lying off the tropical north-eastern coast of Australia. Pollutants from agricultural lands (fine sediments and attached nitrogen (N) mainly from grazing lands, and dissolved N and pesticides mainly from cropping) in catchments draining into the GBR lagoon threaten the health and resilience of this ecosystem. Government actions are prompting farmers to adopt new management practices to reduce pollutant exports from their farms. However, previous agricultural research has, with the exception of erosion, largely focussed on production rather than environmental impacts. Also, the relevance of research conducted in other regions, e.g. Europe and North America, with different climates, soils and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC", "num_citations": 131, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=312583258724332748", "cites_id": ["312583258724332748"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880913002429", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zHT_UtGEVgQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 2, "2014": 8, "2015": 13, "2016": 15, "2017": 20, "2018": 17, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 20, "2022": 15, "2023": 3}}
