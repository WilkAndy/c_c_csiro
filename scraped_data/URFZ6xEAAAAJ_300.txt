Salinisation of floodplain soils, as a result of the changed hydrological management of the River Murray, appears to be a primary cause of the dieback. Regulation of the River Murray has reduced the frequency of large flood events by a factor of approximately three and caused groundwater levels beneath floodplains to rise. The higher water tables have resulted in increased discharge of the naturally saline groundwater in the floodplains by evapotranspiration, while the decreased incidence of large floods has reduced floodwater recharge and hence leaching of salt from floodplain soils. These combined processes have lead to the disturbance of a natural salt \u2018balance\u2019 in the soil profile, leading to accumulation and resultant tree deaths.
