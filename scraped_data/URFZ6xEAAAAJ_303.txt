Mechanistic crop models are a major tool for such predictions, but calibration of crop phenology models is difficult and there is no consensus on the best approach. Here we propose an original, detailed approach, a protocol, for calibration of such models. The protocol covers all the steps in the calibration work-flow, namely choice of default parameter values, choice of objective function, choice of parameters to estimate from the data, calculation of optimal parameter values and diagnostics. The major innovation is in the choice of which parameters to estimate from the data, which combines expert knowledge and data-based model selection. First, almost additive parameters are identified and estimated. This should make bias (average difference between observed and simulated values) nearly zero. These are \u201cobligatory\u201d parameters, that will definitely be estimated. Then candidate parameters are identified, which are parameters likely to explain the remaining discrepancies between simulated and observed values. A candidate is only added to the list of parameters to estimate if it leads to a reduction in BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), which is a model selection criterion. A second original aspect of the protocol is the specification of documentation for each stage of the protocol. The protocol was applied by 19 modeling teams to three data sets for wheat phenology. All teams first calibrated their model using their \u201cusual\u201d calibration approach, so it was possible to compare usual and protocol \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:4Yq6kJLCcecC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6376675440360986746", "cites_id": ["6376675440360986746"], "pub_url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.495355.abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:episJoeAflgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1}}
