It also suggests that products with higher longevity are likely to provide more benefits in terms of N losses. As the longevity of nitrification inhibition is controlled by several environmental factors, understanding how microbial, soil and environmental factors influence the persistence of NIs is needed as this will likely determine their potential to reduce N losses from sugarcane systems. Farmers will likely need a decision-support system that accounts for these factors to maximize the benefits of NI coated fertilizer through targeted use on their farms."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:JWITY9-sCbMC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9768986647341041315", "cites_id": ["9768986647341041315"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193201882", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:owZM8phpkocJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
