Therefore, model improvements have been suggested to reduce uncertainty of climate impact assessments and reduce the number of models required for an acceptable level of simulation uncertainty (Challinor et al., 2014; R\u00f6tter et al., 2011). In this study we improved 15 wheat crop models in simulating heat stress impacts and investigated the effect on MME performances and predictive skills."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hvmnpdAuIbkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1854873659124129291", "cites_id": ["1854873659124129291"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1854873659124129291&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:C55S88PVvRkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1}}
