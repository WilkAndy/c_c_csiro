Calibration is a demanding and critical step in developing and applying a model. Despite its importance little attention has been paid to documenting and analysing current calibration practices. This study reports the results from 211 responses to a web-based survey of calibration practices. The survey questions covered multiple choices that are required when doing a calibration exercise. Concerning data, most respondents used field data, but regional data and a combination of field and regional data were also used. Almost all respondents used multiple data types, the most common being phenology and yield data. The median number of estimated parameters was 6, and often this number was only slightly smaller than the number of environments that provided the data. Most respondents fit the data in multiple stages, starting in most \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17849877005911397748", "cites_id": ["17849877005911397748"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030118300066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dBXDbZCAt_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 16, "2020": 24, "2021": 32, "2022": 39, "2023": 15}}
