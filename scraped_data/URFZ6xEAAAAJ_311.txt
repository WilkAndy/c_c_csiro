However, increasingly crops are being harvested green with trash retailed as blanket (GCTB) due to environmental restrictions. Currently, there is interest in using trash as a feedstock for bioenergy. The presence of a trash blanket affects sugarcane crops, by conservation of soil moisture and a potential to increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To gain insights into the impacts of the burnt-to-green cane trash blanket transition and trash management on sugarcane production in Brazil, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugar farming systems model. Simulations were conducted over 100 years for three locations around Brazil: Piracicaba-SP, Palmas-TO, and Macei\u00f3-AL, addressing two research questions: 1) what is the yield impact of the transition from burnt to GCTB due to soil N, C and water changes; and 2) what is the impact of trash removal on yield in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:F2UWTTQJPOcC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18051037182647655963", "cites_id": ["18051037182647655963"], "pub_url": "https://search.proquest.com/openview/14053f7fa46cc148409a3cc80e3dd909/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=616531", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:G94U260qgvoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1984": 1}}
