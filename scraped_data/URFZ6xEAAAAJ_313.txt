Effective nutrient management on farms is therefore a priority for both farmers and regional authorities.Recognising this, and in response to the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, regional authorities across New Zealand are developing regional plans to improve water quality. In many cases, these plans refer to use of OVERSEER\u00ae, a computer model originally designed to assist farmers and their advisers to examine on-farm nutrient use and movements, in order to optimise production and environmental outcomes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16288041910818075841", "cites_id": ["16288041910818075841"], "pub_url": "https://www.far.org.nz/assets/files/uploads/FAR_OVERSEER_REVIEW_-_final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:wXT89NG_CuIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1}}
