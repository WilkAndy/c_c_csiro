Sugar Cane Technol", "volume": "27", "abstract": "SUSTAINABLY managing N fertiliser is an increasing challenge for sugarcane production, as losses of N impact the health of ecosystems and contribute to climate change (through emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide). The N Replacement (NR) system is a new, ecologically-based concept for N management in sugarcane designed to meet this challenge. The NR system aligns N applications with actual cane production, rather than potential production, by relying on soil N reserves to buffer differences in crop N needs and N fertiliser supply in individual crops. We evaluated the NR system in 11 on-farm experiments in Australia, conducted over a wide range of environments for up to five years. Average yields in the NR treatment were similar to those achieved with the farmers\u2019 conventional N management that had average N applications 66 kg/ha greater than in the NR treatments. Yields increased relative to the farmers\u2019 conventional N management through time, from~ 5 t/ha lower in the first crops of the experiments to 2.6 (standard error= 1.2) t/ha higher in the fourth, suggesting a physiological response in the crops to the variable N applications in the NR system. The crop N surplus, an estimate of N potentially lost to the environment, was 55% lower in the NR treatment compared with conventional N management. This reduction in N surplus was not as great as had been anticipated, as N concentrations and N uptake in cane for most crops in all treatments were lower than those previously reported. The results show that the ecologically-based N Replacement system may deliver superior environmental outcomes without significantly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4609797641933755308", "cites_id": ["4609797641933755308"], "pub_url": "https://www.atamexico.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AGRONOMY-28-Thorburn.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:rBPlFYhK-T8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
