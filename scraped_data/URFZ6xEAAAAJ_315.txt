Environmental damage to the Great Barrier Reef as a result of extra nitrogen inputs since European settlement is becoming increasingly apparent. Sugarcane is the dominant intensive landuse in Great Barrier Reef catchments, and consequently this industry\u2019s nitrogen management practices are coming under increasing scrutiny and pressure to implement nitrogen management practices that reduce losses of nitrogen to the environment. An experiment was conducted in sugarcane on the Wet Tropical coast of Australia to measure nitrogen losses from two different rates of nitrogen fertiliser to surface water. Results show that substantial decreases in nitrogen application rate reduced nitrogen lost to surface water by 34%. Between 10 and 15 kg N/ha/y was lost in runoff water as total nitrogen, which is agronomically insignificant, but aggregated over the whole sugarcane industry, may be detrimental to the health of the Great Barrier Reef. For the sugarcane industry to reduce losses of nitrogen for improved water quality, reducing fertiliser rates is an appropriate management option that can deliver lower nitrogen contributions to downstream ecosystems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13901325154177240246", "cites_id": ["13901325154177240246"], "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP111378&dsid=DS2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tszvSZNt68AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1}}
