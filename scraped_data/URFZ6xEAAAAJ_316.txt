These reductions will be achieved through development and implementation of Water Quality Improvement Plans (WQIPs) in reef catchments. A WQIP requires identification of management practices and targets for their adoption (management action targets) to meet stated regional water quality objectives and provide progressive (quantified) reductions in pollutant loads. Agriculture is an important land use in GBR catchments and has been identified as an important source of diffuse pollution. Thus agricultural industries and local catchment authorities are challenged with developing management practices and adoption targets to meet water quality \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:NyGDZy8z5eUC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14039842170129157687", "cites_id": ["14039842170129157687"], "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14039842170129157687&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Nw4ZRRGK18IJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
