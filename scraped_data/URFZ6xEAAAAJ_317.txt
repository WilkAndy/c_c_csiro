CAS-NIR was calibrated for total N from samples of fibrated cane collected at Mossman, Tully and Maryborough sugar mills in Queensland, Australia, in 2005, 2006 and 20007. To assess the relationship between CAS-NIR determined stem N and N status of crops in the field, stem N was measured in large-plot N rate experiments and compared to CAS-NIR determinations. A good agreement was observed between the CAS-NIR determined stem N concentration and total stem N measured in the field samples. Little or no differences between treatments were observed for stem N, cane yields or leaf N, indicating that the cane was not exhibiting different levels of N stress."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3812428875106304059", "cites_id": ["3812428875106304059"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083147716", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:O0An4Nx36DQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1}}
