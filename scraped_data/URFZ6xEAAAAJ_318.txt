Mineral N and total soil N and C were determined for each 30 cm increment of the soil profile to 150 cm. Sugarcane leaves were sampled and total leaf N and C content determined. The soyabean fallow crop contained 301 kg N/ha. Leaf N analysis showed that the sugarcane plant crop showed insignificant N-stressed during growth despite the low N fertilizer application. APSIM was able to simulate the yields of soyabean and sugarcane to within 22 and 5%, respectively, of observed data. In the majority of cases, the model was able to simulate the amount of mineral N present in the soil profile during the growth of soyabean and sugarcane."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=928555524206128047", "cites_id": ["928555524206128047"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083147712", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:r2uIXlTk4gwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
