Past projects and independent assessments highlighted the harvesting and transport interface as being a high priority due to its current logistical inefficiencies and large potential economic benefits from removing these. The logistical inefficiencies were partly manifested by the social and ownership differences between these sectors. CSE005 aimed to explore and implement multiple opportunities to achieve economic benefits at the harvesting and transport interface of the value chain, using a combined participatory action research and technical modelling approach. The project used case studies, initially being the Mourilyan, Mossman and Plane Creek regions. Each case study had a local industry working group, to drive the process of building models, validation, and developing pathways to adoption. Mourilyan was the basis for the model development due to the broad range of opportunities that the region was to explore and due to its technical capacity to work closely with the research team. This research team was multi-disciplinary across CSIRO, BSES and Harvesting Solutions due to the broad range of modelling expertise required in harvesting and transport. One of the first steps with the Mourilyan case study was to conceptualise the value chain in harvesting and transport, which defined the key linkages and drivers across these sectors. This was the basis for formulating a modelling framework which defined the interactions between the industry \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:CaZNVDsoPx4C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8517404471807818808", "cites_id": ["8517404471807818808"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13179", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OLxtbj3mM3YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1}}
