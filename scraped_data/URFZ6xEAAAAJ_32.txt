Sugarcane production in the Burdekin region in the dry tropics stands out from other crops/regions because it is grown with the highest applications of irrigation water and N fertiliser rates of any sugarcane producing region in Australia, attributes which may enhance losses of N. Little is known about N losses from sugarcane production systems, especially irrigated systems. We measured parts of the water and N balance over three sugarcane crops at three contrasting sites in different parts of the Burdekin region, covering a range of soil types/textures and irrigation managements. The experimental data were used to parameterise the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model, and the model then used to \u2018infill\u2019 missing data and develop more complete \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC", "num_citations": 129, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12772480660562957530", "cites_id": ["12772480660562957530"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911002829", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2tRmQX33QLEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 4, "2013": 14, "2014": 14, "2015": 11, "2016": 14, "2017": 12, "2018": 14, "2019": 11, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
