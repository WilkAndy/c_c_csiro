While many studies have been conducted on the impact of trash blanketing on issues such as yield, soil erosion and soil physical properties, surprisingly little is known about the fate of nutrients in trash (whether burnt or retained), the decomposition of trash blankets, or impacts of GCTB on soil fertility and hence fertiliser management. This project aimed to provide information on these issues and so determine if canegrowers need to change their nutrient management strategies when they switch from burnt cane harvesting to a GCTB system. Principal findings from this project are: \u2022 Burning trash reduces trash dry matter by 70 % (pre-harvest burn) to 95 % (pre- and postharvest burn), and the loss of nutrients when trash is burnt is strongly related to the loss of dry matter. Thus GCTB can substantially increase organic matter and nutrient retention. \u2022 Rainfall will quickly leach some nutrients, especially potassium (K), from freshly harvested trash into the soil. \u2022 Trash decomposes slower than expected from its biochemical composition, with up to 10% of trash deposited on the soil after harvest still present one year later. However, the decomposition of trash can be accurately predicted across soils types and climates from sugarcane-specific residue decomposition models. \u2022 Trash blanketing, for up to 17 years, increases soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:sNmaIFBj_lkC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13487514461622332621", "cites_id": ["13487514461622332621"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13085", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zWzxY_FGLbsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1}}
