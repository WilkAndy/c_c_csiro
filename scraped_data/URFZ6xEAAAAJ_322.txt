In recognition of this, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation of Australia provided funds for an international workshop on sugarcane physiology in September 2003. The goal of the workshop was to identify the critical gaps in our understanding of sugarcane physiology that, if addressed by research, could lead to advances in the economic and environmental sustainability of sugarcane production. This paper presents some of these gaps and identifies opportunities for increased production and resource use efficiency. It is likely that current sucrose yield potential will not be substantially increased through current conventional breeding and agronomic approaches, as much as through targeted genetic improvements in areas such as photosynthetic efficiency and partitioning of photosynthates among metabolic pools. In many cases, we are not achieving currently attainable yields partly because of lodging, flowering, suckering, reduced soil health, tiller senescence and stalk death. Selection against some of these traits and mitigating management practices will help to reduce the gap between attainable and actual yields. Productivity can also be increased by better matching cultivars with the environment and by managing them to fully exploit their favourable traits. Models capable of simulating cultivar differences are essential for such advances. The workshop participants recognized that closer collaboration between molecular biologists, breeders, agronomists and modellers to explore and exploit the interaction of genotype and environment (including \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6396335250127204351", "cites_id": ["6396335250127204351"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20053159404", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_y8kUAVZxFgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1}}
