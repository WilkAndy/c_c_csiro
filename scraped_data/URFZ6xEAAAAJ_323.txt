The availability of N in trash left in the field following harvest is complicated because most of the N cycles through the soil organic matter. To gain insights into the impacts of trash management on sugarcane production and the long-term fate of N contained in trash, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model. Long-term simulations were conducted for two different soil types combined with climatic data from three locations. Trash management and N fertiliser application rates were varied in the simulations. The simulation study showed that sugarcane yields have potential to respond positively to retention of trash in the field over the range of climates considered. However, achieving these higher potential yields will require that N applications not be reduced following the switch from trash burning to trash retention. This study also illustrates the potential negative, short-term impact of trash retention on sugarcane yields due to the immobilisation of N by the decomposing trash. The simulations also indicate that average environmental losses of N are likely to be greater where trash is retained and particular care should be exercised to avoid over-application of N in green cane trash blanket systems systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8500168939455290513", "cites_id": ["8500168939455290513"], "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2004/symposia/6/2/1349_thorburnp.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kZwKV52q9nUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 1}}
