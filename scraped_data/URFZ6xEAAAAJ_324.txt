However, few Australian sugar growers consciously reduce their irrigation rates to take advantage of this valuable resource. In a field trial at Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia, crop response to irrigation was measured when a shallow water table was situated between 1 and 1.2 metres below the soil's surface. Under these conditions, the water table provided approximately 23% of the crop's evapotranspiration. In addition, crop responses showed that irrigation might be unnecessary when the water table is within one metre of the soil's surface."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12554505015868909375", "cites_id": ["12554505015868909375"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033076930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:P-e5mcuPOq4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
