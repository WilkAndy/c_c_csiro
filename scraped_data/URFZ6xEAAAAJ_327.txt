Trees in two landscape positions, on creek banks and approximately 40m from creeks, were studied. The trees distant from the creek were only sampled when flooded. The {2}H and {18}O concentrations of water sampled from the trees were significantly different from those of the creek water, indicating that generally some water came from the saline soils or water table. This was found even in trees overlying high saline groundwater. Trees distant from the creek also showed little evidence of surface water uptake. The results indicated that the water relations of these trees are complex, and the trees may be less affected by changes in creek flow and/or salinity than previously anticipated."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17397985210333475226", "cites_id": ["17397985210333475226"], "pub_url": "https://search.informit.org/doi/abs/10.3316/INFORMIT.755193731842350", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mjFtzV4PcvEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1}}
