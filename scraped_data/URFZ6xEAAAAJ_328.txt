We address this knowledge gap by identifying practices that provide abatement in eight case studies located across diverse conditions in Australian\u2019s grain-producing areas. The case studies focus on soil-based emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), simulated over 100 years for 15 cropping management scenarios. Average changes in the balance of GHG from both N2O emissions and SOC sequestration (\u2206GHG balance) and gross margins compared to a high emissions baseline were determined over 25 and 100 simulated years. Because scenarios providing the greatest abatement varied across individual case studies, we aggregated the data over all case studies \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:6VlyvFCUEfcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-023-00880-1", "cites_per_year": {}}
