Currently, there is a knowledge gap of how well process-based models can estimate the economic optimum nitrogen rate (EONR) across environments and years.We evaluated the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) software ability to simulate corn yield response to nitrogen (N) input and crop rotation in long term experiments. Furthermore, we explored causes for over/under prediction of the EONR.Measurements included crop yields from 14 long-term (N) fertilizer rate experiments representing major production regions in the U.S. Corn Belt and SOM distribution from seven long-term experiments. Corn yield response to N rate was analyzed with statistical models to estimate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:oTdOBqtIf_kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X23000343", "cites_per_year": {}}
