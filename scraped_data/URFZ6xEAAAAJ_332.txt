Government policies need information on water quality and risk associated with improved practices to evaluate the benefits of their adoption. Policies protecting Great Barrier Reef (GBR) ecosystems are an example of this situation. We developed a simple metric for assessing the risk of N discharge from sugarcane cropping, the biggest contributor of dissolved inorganic N to the GBR. The metric, termed NiLRI, is the ratio of N fertiliser applied to crops and the cane yield achieved (i.e. kg N (t cane)\u22121). We defined seven classes of water quality risk using NiLRI values derived from first principles reasoning. NiLRI values calculated from (1) results of historical field experiments and (2) survey data on the management of 170,177 ha \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479722015055", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:RUobIZ6oKaoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
