However, they rarely appreciate the link between their practices and water quality, something which is necessary for them to change management. Existing water quality information systems are not designed to raise farmer awareness and facilitate improved management. We developed an application, 1622WQ (https://wq. 1622. farm/), using user experience design principles to provide farmers with real-time, high frequency information on nitrate concentration and other contextual variables in creeks and rivers of Great Barrier Reef catchments. The app is having impact. It attracted> 1,000 users within a few months of being launched, with that engagement being maintained, and there is evidence it is changing farmers\u2019 attitudes about local water quality and their practices. The Queensland Government is adopting it to communicate their data to farmers and advisors. There is also demand for it in pesticide monitoring activities, with a version being developed for that purpose."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:PQEM9vzQD9gC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2022/TechnologyModellingAndCropSensing/ASAthorburn_p_536s.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:U3JqrBhrzp8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
