It is also increasingly a means of predicting likely performance for better managing cropping systems. In this paper we will briefly describe the development path over the past five decades that has resulted in our current well developed cropping systems modelling capability. We will also discuss new initiatives in sensing, data acquisition and processing (ML/AI) and how these might influence the future of models. These development will result in our models to having even greater impact on the performance of cropping systems in the future."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:NMlhSUseqAsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/618420", "cites_per_year": {}}
