To measure and report on progress towards the targets set a program has been established that combines monitoring and modelling at paddock through to catchment and reef scales; the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (Paddock to Reef Program). This program aims to provide evidence of links between land management activities, water quality and reef health. Five lines of evidence are used: the effectiveness of management practices to improve water quality; the prevalence of management practice adoption and change in catchment indicators; long-term monitoring of catchment water quality; paddock & catchment modelling to provide a relative assessment of progress towards meeting targets; and finally marine \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6419520118795179099", "cites_id": ["6419520118795179099"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X1100614X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:W5RCNYm3FlkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 10, "2013": 18, "2014": 16, "2015": 12, "2016": 12, "2017": 8, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 3, "2021": 13, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
