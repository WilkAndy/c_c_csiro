We explore the dynamical systems that affect rainfall in the sugar cane growing region, where nitrogen losses pose the greatest ecological threat. We then evaluate seasonal climate forecasting model's (ACCESS-S) ability to simulate these dynamical features. El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant feature of climate variability for northeast Australia; however, the moisture availability arises from the ENSO teleconnection to the north-south movements of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). While ACCESS-S can simulate the Nino3. 4 variability and movement of the SPCZ, spatial biases in the SPCZ latitude and slope alter the moisture availability to coastal northeast Australia inhibiting the skill of regional rainfall \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=10297006&AN=140488459&h=CMCWs7x9XxyQVd9K3RH%2FI2%2BWXp7FX7GX9526MmxREtVFWnImZi6EgBkRgVQY%2FInkcvr4jsF%2Br8BvVIh5Wa6O1A%3D%3D&crl=c", "cites_per_year": {}}
