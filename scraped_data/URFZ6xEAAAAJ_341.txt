We evaluated the ability of a seasonal climate forecasting model (ACCESS-S) to predict summer rainfall for the wet tropics region of northeastern Australia. We found that ACCESS-S was unable to capture the rainfall variability, primarily due to not being able to capture the extreme events."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2019/2019ASA_Dayal_Kavina_87.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dYPnScoKNcYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
