We hypothesize that the use of a crop model as an in-season forecast tool will improve current N decision-making. To explore this, we used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) calibrated with long-term experimental data for central Iowa, USA (16-years in continuous corn and 15-years in soybean-corn rotation) combined with actual weather data up to a specific crop stage and historical weather data thereafter. The objectives were to:(1) evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty of corn yield and economic optimum N rate (EONR) predictions at four forecast times (planting time, 6th and 12th leaf, and silking phenological stages);(2) determine whether the use of analogous historical weather years based on precipitation and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:1r-w4gtu6w8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16622614808317480855&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l0_pBxlkr-YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
