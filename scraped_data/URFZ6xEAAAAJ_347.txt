In order to provide this, we must improve the rigor of agricultural modelling. Ensemble approaches can be used to address scale issues and integrated teams can overcome disciplinary silos. The AgMIP Coordinated Global and Regional Assessments of Climate Change and Food Security (CGRA) has the goal to link agricultural systems models using common protocols and scenarios to significantly improve understanding of climate effects on crops, livestock and livelihoods across multiple scales. The AgMIP CGRA assessment brings together experts in climate, crop, livestock, economics, and food security to develop Protocols to guide the process throughout the assessment. Scenarios are designed to consistently combine elements of intertwined storylines of future society including, socioeconomic development, greenhouse gas concentrations, and specific pathways of agricultural sector development. Through these approaches, AgMIP partners around the world are providing an evidence base for their stakeholders as they make decisions and investments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20180000622", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zVQMz5pEKKcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
