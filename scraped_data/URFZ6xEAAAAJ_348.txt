However, C sequestration stimulates N2 O emissions, making the net greenhouse-gas abatement potential of management practices difficult to predict. We studied land-management practices that have potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by increasing soilCstorage and/or decreasing soilN2 Oemissions for a diverse range of broadacre grain cropping sites inNewSouth Wales. Carbon sequestration and N2 O emissions were simulated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) for a baseline crop-management scenario and alternative scenarios representing management practices for greenhouse gas abatement, for 15 rainfed or irrigated sites.
