A user-friendly software tool, WetUp, has been developed to help highlight the impact of soils on water distribution in trickle-irrigated systems. WetUp determines the approximate radial and vertical wetting distances from an emitter in homogeneous soils calculated using analytical methods, and then uses an elliptical plotting function to approximate the expected wetted perimeter. In this paper we describe WetUp and use examples to demonstrate how it can be applied. We also compare the wetted perimeter predicted using WetUp with that predicted by other methods. Results show that the wetting pattern is well described by the ellipsoidal approximation for slowly permeable soils, but that it tends to underestimate the radial wetting in highly \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC", "num_citations": 126, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17643669793142983145", "cites_id": ["17643669793142983145"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00271-003-0078-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6cmTWjLo2vQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 4, "2004": 0, "2005": 4, "2006": 4, "2007": 4, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 9, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 5, "2019": 9, "2020": 12, "2021": 8, "2022": 11, "2023": 3}}
