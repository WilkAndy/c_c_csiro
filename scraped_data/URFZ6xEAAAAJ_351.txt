Chapter 4: management options and their effectiveness", "pub_year": 2017, "citation": "State of Queensland, 2017", "author": "Rachel Eberhard and Peter Thorburn and John Rolfe and Bruce Taylor and Mike Ronan and Tony Webber and Nicole Flint and Frederieke Kroon and Mark Silburn and Rebecca Bartley and Aaron Davis and Scott Wilkinson and Stephen Lewis and Megan Star and Mark Poggio and Jill Windle and Nadine Marshall and Rosemary Hill and Kirsten Maclean and Pethie Lyons and Cathy Robinson and Fernanda Adame and Amelia Selles and Matthew Griffiths and John Gunn and Kevin McCosker", "publisher": "State of Queensland", "abstract": "This chapter seeks to answer the following questions: 1. What are the values of the Great Barrier Reef? 2. How effective are better agricultural practices in improving water quality? 3. How can we improve the uptake of better agricultural practices? 4. What water quality improvement can non-agricultural land uses contribute? 5. How can Great Barrier Reef water quality improvement programs be improved? Each section summarises the currently available peer reviewed literature and comments on implications for management and research gaps. This chapter has a wider scope than previous Scientific Consensus Statements, including, for the first time, the social and governance dimensions of management and the management of non-agricultural land uses. These new sections are constrained by a lack of Great Barrier Reef\u2013specific data and information. The relevance of information from other locations must be carefully considered. In comparison, the agricultural practice change and economics sections provide an update on material compiled as part of the 2013 Scientific Consensus Statement. This report has been confined to peer reviewed literature, which is generally published in books and journals or major reports. There is additional evidence in grey literature, such as project and program reports, that has not been included here. Each section of this chapter has been compiled by a writing team and then revised following a series of review processes."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:SAZ1SQo2q1kC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/50120/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8bGEPITrWKIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
