Thus, it is essential to increase the efficiency in using water to ensure crop productivity. Quantifying crop water use (WU; ie actual evapotranspiration) is a critical step towards this goal. Here, sixteen wheat simulation models were used to quantify sources of model uncertainty and to estimate the relative changes and variability between models for simulated WU, water use efficiency (WUE, WU per unit of grain dry mass produced), transpiration efficiency (Teff, transpiration per kg of unit of grain yield dry mass produced), grain yield, crop transpiration and soil evaporation at increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]). The greatest uncertainty in simulating water use, potential evapotranspiration, crop transpiration and soil evaporation was due to differences in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:c59VksA5Vz4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16363493775595302390&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
