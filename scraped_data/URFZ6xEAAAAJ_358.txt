Using such this approach, wheat and maize grain yields response to temperature increase were simulated by Asseng et al., 2015 and Bassu et al., 2014 using annually re-initialized soil conditions (soil water and nitrogen). Basso et al., 2015, showed that by running models in a continuous mode, yield results differed from the annual reinitialized runs. In this study, we present the results of continuous model run of the AgMIP wheat-and maize-pilot under temperature and CO2 changes and different management practices."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:RtRctb2lSbAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=403346963880100582&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5kJON-35mAUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
