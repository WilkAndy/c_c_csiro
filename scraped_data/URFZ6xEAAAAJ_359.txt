These findings highlight the need for MME approach to better address yield projection uncertainty. However, the MME approach itself does not lead to improvement in process understanding. Here we extend the model intercomparison to investigate how the uncertainties in simulation results arise from process-level algorithms and parameterization in the models and to identify knowledge gaps."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:RuPIJ_LgqDgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=573043356417288754&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:MmomhOXb8wcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
