The purpose of this study was to address these knowledge gaps by determining the magnitude and time scale of changes in soil concentrations of total C, C fractions and plant nutrients following retention of sugarcane residues. C fractions were determined by two different methods. We sampled soils from five experiments, in contrasting environments, where sugarcane residues had been either retained or removed for between 1 and 17 years. Changes in the concentration of both soil C and plant nutrients were highly site-specific and not in proportion to the period that residues were retained: for example, soil C (0\u2013250mm) decreased by 0.9gkg\u22121 and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC", "num_citations": 124, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6057881897491544505", "cites_id": ["6057881897491544505"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016719871100208X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ublAX33rEVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 15, "2014": 7, "2015": 8, "2016": 13, "2017": 26, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 11, "2021": 6, "2022": 7, "2023": 5}}
