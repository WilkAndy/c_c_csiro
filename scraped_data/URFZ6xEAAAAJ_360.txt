We tested the ability of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate corn and soybean (Glycine max L.) yields, the economic optimum N rate (EONR) using a 16-year field-experiment dataset from central Iowa, USA that included two crop sequences (continuous corn and soybean-corn) and five N fertilizer rates (0, 67, 134, 201, and 268 kg N ha-1) applied to corn. Our objectives were to:(a) quantify model prediction accuracy before and after calibration, and report calibration steps;(b) compare crop model-based techniques in estimating optimal N rate for corn; and (c) utilize the calibrated model to explain factors causing year to year variability in yield and optimal N. Results indicated that the model simulated well long-term crop yields response to N (relative root mean square error \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:jlhcAiayVhoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18332650358973691504&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cHYQ9l6oav4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
