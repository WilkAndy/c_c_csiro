Crop simulations models are playing an increasing role in researches related to the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and have proven to be useful tools in climate impact studies (Palosuo et al., 2011). Recent maize (Bassu et al., 2014) and wheat (Asseng et al., 2015) multi-modelling ensembles have predicted grain yield declines across the globe in response to global temperature increases. But none of these models have been used in continuous mode (Basso et al., 2015), rather annually re-initializing pre-seasons soil conditions. In an effort to evaluate the long-term impacts of soil modifications on crop production under climate change conditions, we present the largest multi-modelling ensemble exercise so far conducted with crop models run under sequential mode."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/202316/1/esa2014_abstract_Dumont.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Bm5-ltigzbAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
