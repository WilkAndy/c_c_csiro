The first software has as its central element on the K-NN algorithm and the second one on artificial neural networks, both of them output hydraulic soil properties; all of them were used as a tool for increasing knowledge about strategies to simulate the flux of nitrous oxide gas (related to the greenhouse effect) from sugar cane farm for fuel ethanol and other products. The data used to set Kdenit in experiments were previously published [4]. The values used from this data set were the hourly averages (n 8) of nitrous oxide fluxes emitted to the atmosphere in three different treatments about dosage of trash maintained after harvest above the soil of a sugar cane field configuring this treatments: T1 (7 tons/ha), T2 (14 tons/ha), T3 (21 tons/ha)(random blocks, 4x2 factorial, without application of vinasse). Using Kdenit 0.0008 (P2), simulated emissions of PTFAA approach was compared to that produced by KRAc approach (Figures 1, 2 and 3).
