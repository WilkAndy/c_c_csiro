However, most impact research on agriculture to date has focused on impacts of warming >2\u00b0C on mean crop yields, and many previous studies did not focus sufficiently on extreme events and yield interannual variability. Here, with the latest climate scenarios from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project, we evaluated the impacts of the 2015 Paris Agreement range of global warming (1.5 and 2.0\u00b0C warming above the pre\u2010industrial period) on global wheat production and local yield variability. A multi\u2010crop and multi\u2010climate model ensemble over a global network of sites developed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) for Wheat was used to represent major rainfed and irrigated wheat \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC", "num_citations": 122, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5623538397404003965", "cites_id": ["5623538397404003965"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14542", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ff4IrmDSCk4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 7, "2020": 31, "2021": 33, "2022": 36, "2023": 13}}
