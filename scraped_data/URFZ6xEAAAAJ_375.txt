Therefore, mitigation of N2O emissions from agricultural systems is important. In this study, the trade-off between crop yield and N2O emissions in subtropical cereal and fibre cropping systems under various management practices was investigated to identify potential mitigation options. For this, the APSIM model was first tested against data from a field experiment on a vertosol comprising several irrigation treatments in subtropical Queensland. One soil hydraulic parameter and one parameter in the denitrification sub-model were calibrated against a subset of the data. The validity of the model was confirmed with the remaining data. For the six datasets we found a good correlation between measured and predicted yields (R2= 0.90) and seasonal N2O emissions (R2= 0.49). Long-term scenarios were then calculated with the validated model. Long-term average yield and N2O emissions both increased under increased nitrogen (N) supply from legumes or extra N fertiliser, and so, there was a trade-off between maximising yield and minimising N2O emissions. N2O emissions also increased when crop yields were limited due to water stress, because of increased mineral N availability. Given the annual variability in climate and soil nitrogen availability, mitigating N2O emissions is not a simple task. A tool for proper yield forecasting could therefore be of great benefit for estimating the amount of nitrogen required and thus assist in managing N efficiently and in mitigating N2O emissions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:OP4eGU-M3BUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2015_Conference/pdf/agronomy2015final00394.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oIRu3DeXIPoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
