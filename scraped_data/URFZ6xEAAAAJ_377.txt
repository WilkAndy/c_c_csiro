Most observational data sets of N gas fluxes are for N2O measured using ground based chambers at small spatial and temporal resolution and interpolation and extrapolation are used to estimate annual emissions at the plot scale. These plot level data are then used to develop and test models of varying complexity, ranging from empirical models based mainly on N application rates to process based models that account for how vegetation, land management and environmental factors interact to control N gas losses. This is problematic for two reasons; first, N gas emissions are highly variable in space and time so annual plot level emission estimates based on infrequent sampling are suspect and second, testing of models that predict daily fluxes is limited because models often predict \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:HtS1dXgVpQUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.B14B..03D/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
