Simulations were conducted over the past 14 years with data from an experiment in the municipality of Linhares-ES. The trash management systems simulated were Green Cane Harvesting and Trash Blanketing (GCTB), half GCTB, and burnt trash. N fertiliser management systems were simulated by varying N fertiliser application with rates from 0 to 240 kg/ha (in 40 kg/ha increments) on the ratoon crops. Cane yields from the experiment were simulated well by the model with Root Mean Square Errors between predicted and measured values of 14.02 t/ha and 13.45 t/ha for the for the burnt and GCTB treatments, respectively.
