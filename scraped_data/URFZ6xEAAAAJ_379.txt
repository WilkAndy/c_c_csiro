The majority of its anthropogenic emissions stem from agricultural production systems. The abatement of nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils is therefore an important topic worldwide. In Australia, a collaborative network of 17 field, laboratory and simulation research projects across the country has been established, currently known as the National Agricultural Nitrous Oxide Research Program (NANORP). The overall objective of the program is to develop robust N2O mitigation strategies for Australian agricultural soils while maintaining productive and profitable farming systems. One approach is the application and, if necessary, the advancement of suitable plant-soil simulation models to simulate the impacts of management interventions on carbon/nitrogen dynamics and N2O emissions. Well designed and calibrated processbased models are valuable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE02445715", "cites_per_year": {}}
