Model improvements can improve the accuracy of simulations and reduce the uncertainty of climate change impact assessments. Furthermore, they can reduce the number of models needed in a MME. Herein, 15 wheat growth models of a larger MME were improved through re-parameterization and/or incorporating or modifying heat stress effects on phenology, leaf growth and senescence, biomass growth, and grain number and size using detailed field experimental data from the USDA Hot Serial Cereal experiment (calibration data set). Simulation results from before and after model improvement were then evaluated with independent field experiments from a CIMMYT world-wide field trial network (evaluation data set). Model improvements decreased the variation (10th to 90th \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C", "num_citations": 120, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15915147789226466499", "cites_id": ["15915147789226466499"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429016301368", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w9yvnJf23dwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 11, "2018": 27, "2019": 14, "2020": 24, "2021": 14, "2022": 18, "2023": 12}}
