The majority of anthropogenic N2O emissions stem from agricultural production systems, which highlights the necessity for mitigation strategies. Modelling analyses of experimental information increase our understanding of processes and factors driving N2O production and emission, which is indispensable for developing mitigation strategies. Reliable and robust models are needed for long-term simulations to investigate mitigation strategies. In this study, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was calibrated and validated for the prediction of N2O emissions with experimental data from different field sites, crops and treatments. We used numerical optimisation to estimate soil moisture parameters for each site to obtain good predictions of measured soil water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:354235", "cites_per_year": {}}
