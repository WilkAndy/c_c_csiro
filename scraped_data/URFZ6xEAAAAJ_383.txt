The authors analysed the APSIM-Sugar (AS) and DSSAT/CANEGRO (DC) models to determine their structural differences, and how these differences affect their predictions of crop growth and production in Brazil. Both models initially under-estimated leaf area index (LAI) and hence interception of solar radiation, although both accurately predicted crop growth and production after calibration. The AS model under-predicted yield at the hotter sites. Average predictions from both models of stalk yield and LAI resulted in closer predictions of the data than from the models individually."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20163376329", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:nxqjByR1lSQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
