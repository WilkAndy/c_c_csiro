However, increasingly crops are being harvested green with trash retailed as blanket (GCTB) due to environmental restrictions. Currently, there is interest in using trash as a feedstock for bioenergy. The presence of a trash blanket affects sugarcane crops, by conservation of soil moisture and a potential to increase soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To gain insights into the impacts of the burntto-green cane trash blanket transition and trash management on sugarcane production in Brazil, a simulation study was conducted with the APSIM-Sugar farming systems model. Simulations were conducted over 100 years for three locations around Brazil: Piracicaba-SP, Palmas-TO, and Macei\u00f3-AL, addressing two research questions:(1) what is the yield impact of the transition from burnt to GCTB due to soil N, C and water changes; and (2) what is the impact of trash removal on yield in fields managed under GCTBs. Both questions were answered based on the same set of simulations. We simulated the transition to GCTB after 25 years of burnt management combining four nitrogen application rates (50, 100, 150 and 200 kg/ha). The second goal was addressed by setting up three simulation treatments (100% trash retention, 50% trash removal and 90% trash removal) under the same N fertiliser rates. The simulation study showed that sugarcane yields have potential to respond positively to trash retention, and stalk yield for 50% and 90% trash removal treatments decreased at rates proportional to the trash extraction rate only in Piracicaba. In Palmas, located in a dryer region, simulations showed trash retention \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193249739", "cites_per_year": {}}
