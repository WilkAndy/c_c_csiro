The goal is to improve characterization of climate change effects on world food production and food security. The global gridded AgMIP protocol starts with completion of a matrix of inputs and processes by participating global crop models. Documenting differences in terms of model inputs, ways of estimating initial conditions, and management assumptions can result in major differences in the model outputs. Biophysical processes embedded in global economic models will also be documented. The aim is to standardize as many of these to the extent possible (eg, planting dates, N fertilizer, etc.) so as to enable useful comparisons of climate change scenario results.Crop-soil model characteristics and processes in the AgMIP matrix include timestep, leaf area development, light interception, light utilization, yield formation, crop phenology, root distribution, water and heat stress, water dynamics, evapotranspiration, soil C/N model, CO 2 effects, and cultivar coefficients. The matrix also documents model inputs, their sources, and assumptions relative to source of weather data, spatial scale of inputs, land masses covered; source of soil property inputs, source of planting details, nitrogen fertilizer amounts and dates of application, crop residue management, and initial soil water, nitrate, ammonia, carbon and organic matter, carbon pools, and crop residues.
