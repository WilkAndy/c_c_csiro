Proceedings of 16th Australian Agronomy Conference 2012, 14-18 October 2012, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia", "publisher": "Australian Society of Agronomy Inc", "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is critical for crop production, but N losses to water from farming systems have the potential to negatively impact ecosystem health. Along the north-eastern Australian coast, N pollution of groundwater and environmental damage to the Great Barrier Reef have been attributed to N fertiliser applications. Sugarcane is the dominant intensive landuse in these catchments, and consequently the sugarcane industry\u2019s N management practices are coming under increasing scrutiny. A three year experiment was conducted in sugarcane on the Wet Tropical coast of north-east Australia to measure crop production and dissolved inorganic-N (DIN) losses from two different N fertiliser management practices: The farmers\u2019 conventional application rate (average 180 kg N/ha/yr) and a reduced rate based on replacing N exported in the previous crop (average 95 kg N/ha/yr). Losses of DIN to groundwater were measured in one of those years. The reduced N rate maintained yield over all three years and did not lead to any soil mineral N depletion in comparison with the conventional fertiliser rate. As well, DIN losses in surface water were 72%, 48% and 66% lower in the three years compared to the conventional practice, and losses to groundwater were 58% lower in the first year. While the proportion of DIN lost from sugarcane that reaches the Great Barrier Reef lagoon remains uncertain, these results suggest that adoption of N rates based on replacing N exported in the previous crop can sustain yield (without \u2018mining\u2019the soil) and help reduce the impacts of DIN."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2012/8086_5_webster.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7nfF5YkmqaYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
