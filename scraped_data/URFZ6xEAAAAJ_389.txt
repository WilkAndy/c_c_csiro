Proceedings of 16th Australian Agronomy Conference 2012, 14-18 October 2012, Armidale, New South Wales, Australia", "publisher": "Australian Society of Agronomy Inc", "abstract": "One method for sequestering carbon (C) within agricultural soils is to increase productivity and therefore C input into the soil. However, there is a potential trade-off between decreased C emissions and increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions if this is achieved via nitrogenous fertilisers. An alternative is to incorporate legumes into cropping rotations to provide a biological source of nitrogen (N). However, the impacts on C input and N2O emissions when replacing cereal crops with legumes are unknown. Consequently, an analysis has been undertaken for a subtropical cropping system where soil, climate and management are conducive to denitrification losses.Scenarios covering a range of cropping rotations, N fertiliser applications and leguminous crops were tested using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). The model was tested using long term data from the Brigalow Catchment Study site near Theodore, Queensland, Australia. Scenario analyses demonstrated that soil C can be managed to some degree via simple changes in agronomic practice. However, reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were often offset by increased N2O emissions. The use of legumes within cereal rotations was not always as effective in reducing N2O emissions as improved fertiliser practice. For example, replacing wheat crops with chickpea did not reduce N2O emissions relative to fertilised systems and did not assist in increasing soil C relative to unfertilised systems. The fact that some interventions proved counterproductive due to complex feedbacks highlights the need for careful consideration of agronomic interventions to manage \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2012/8098_5_huth.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w6AOB4h-e0cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
