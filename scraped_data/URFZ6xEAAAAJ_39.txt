Firstly, water of known isotopic composition was extracted from stems of seedlings of Eucalyptus spp. by azeotropic distillation using three solvents (hexane, toluene and kerosene) in laboratory and glasshouse experiments. Kerosene and toluene gave the most accurate extractions, with a small negative bias (\u223c\u20102\u2030 for \u03b42H and \u223c\u20100.4\u2030 for \u03b418O) due to incomplete extraction. This bias was not evident in further experiments, using kerosene, where water was extracted from stems and roots that had been pre\u2010treated in a manner that more closely reflected field conditions. Secondly, variation in \u03b42H in trees was investigated in the field to determine an accurate and convenient place for sampling. There was no significant difference in \u03b42H between water extracted from trunk sapwood \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC", "num_citations": 119, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4991292574098922950", "cites_id": ["4991292574098922950"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1993.tb00869.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xh02sSaiREUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 4, "1995": 4, "1996": 6, "1997": 4, "1998": 3, "1999": 5, "2000": 3, "2001": 4, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 6, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 4, "2008": 7, "2009": 7, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 6, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
