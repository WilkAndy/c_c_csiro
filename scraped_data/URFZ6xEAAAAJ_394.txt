But concepts need to be parameterised and model behaviour needs to reproduce reality. Modern methods attempting to measure SOM composition are showing great promise for parameterising these models but one simple approach is often overlooked, using what we already know. For example, the behaviour of SOM under different agricultural systems, for different soil types, or in different regions is often well understood and for a model to be credible, it must reproduce this behaviour. Whilst this is generally accepted, modellers are not always aware of the value of this data for building their model, rather than just for testing their model. It is possible to deduce, a priori, the apparent SOM composition from observed changes in measured total C and C: N ratio. Form follows function, or in this case, SOM composition can be deduced from soil behaviour. This is demonstrated using simple deductions applied to a long term dataset to predict changes in SOM and crop productivity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://iuss.org/19th%20WCSS/Symposium/pdf/0291.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4cy2S7t1iccJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
