However, for maximum environmental benefit to accrue through PA, existing regional or whole-of-industry management guidelines need replacing by those for site-specific management-a change which requires a marked enhancement to current agronomic understanding."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://agronomyaustraliaproceedings.org/images/sampledata/2008/concurrent/agronomy-landscape/5857_bramleyrg.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IpWf8bNvkwgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
