The goals of AgMIP are to improve substantially the characterization of world food security due to climate change and to enhance adaptation capacity in both developing and developed countries. Analyses of the agricultural impacts of climate variability and change require a transdisciplinary effort to consistently link state-of-the-art climate scenarios to crop and economic models. Crop model outputs are aggregated as inputs to regional and global economic models to determine regional vulnerabilities, changes in comparative advantage, price effects, and potential adaptation \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC", "num_citations": 994, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4572643094092470158", "cites_id": ["4572643094092470158"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192312002857", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jlcGzKpKdT8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 7, "2013": 23, "2014": 76, "2015": 100, "2016": 82, "2017": 121, "2018": 124, "2019": 98, "2020": 101, "2021": 129, "2022": 92, "2023": 31}}
