However, there is little information on the extent of the possible reduction in N application rate for fertigated sugarcane, one of the major row crops grown under trickle irrigation, nor the fate of N in fertigated sugarcane systems if N application rates are not reduced. An experiment was established to determine the response of cane and sugar production to different N rates (0\u2013240 kg ha\u22121 year\u22121) spanning that recommended for conventional irrigation systems (160 kg ha\u22121 year\u22121). As well as yield, N removed in the crop and changes in soil mineral N were determined annually for four crops (a plant and three ratoon crops). \u03b415N values were also measured in selected treatments at selected times to assess possible N inputs to the experiment via \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C", "num_citations": 118, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2179620965432909558", "cites_id": ["2179620965432909558"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00271-003-0086-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9l6fTbiRPx4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 3, "2003": 4, "2004": 4, "2005": 3, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 4, "2009": 5, "2010": 12, "2011": 8, "2012": 5, "2013": 12, "2014": 6, "2015": 8, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 6, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 2}}
