However, applying N increases losses of N to the environment, and so all intensive agricultural industries face the challenge of maintaining productivity while minimising environmental impacts of N fertiliser use. This challenge has become particularly important for sugarcane production in Australia because community concern grows over the impact of N on the health of the Great Barrier Reef and sugarcane production has the largest use of N fertiliser in the region. It has been suggested that replacing the N lost from a crop through harvested cane and environmental losses will better align N fertiliser applications to the actual needs of sugarcane crops and the other potential sources of N available to the crop, and so improve the financial and environmental sustainability of the Australian sugarcane industry. In this project we tested and further developed an innovative N fertiliser management system, the N Replacement (NR) system."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13981", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Z0GG3nwKFXUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
