Since then progress in sugarcane physiology at all levels (molecular to crop) has fallen behind that of other major crops. In recognition of the comparatively poor state of physiological knowledge in sugarcane and the divergence in the research areas at the molecular to whole crop scales, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation (SRDC) of Australia provided funds for an international workshop on sugarcane physiology, with the theme of integrating knowledge from cell to crop to advance sugarcane production. The goal of the workshop, which was attended by about 40 delegates, was to identify the critical gaps in our understanding of plant and crop physiology for sugarcane that, if addressed by research, could lead to advances in the economic and environmental sustainability of sugarcane production.The aim of this paper is to summarise the more practical aspects of the review of sugarcane physiology conducted during this workshop and later published in a special issue of Field Crops Research (Inman-Bamber et al., 2005). We refer frequently to papers and citations in this special issue for those wanting more detail on the science while endeavouring to focus on practical use of physiological knowledge in this paper."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nils-Berding/publication/305390170_Inman-Bamber_NG_et_al_POINTERS_FOR_BETTER_FARMING_AND_RESEARCH_FROM_SUGARCANE_PHYSIOLOGY/links/578c5ec508ae59aa667c4f29/Inman-Bamber-NG-et-al-POINTERS-FOR-BETTER-FARMING-AND-RESEARCH-FROM-SUGARCANE-PHYSIOLOGY.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:id1GzIH3IeQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
