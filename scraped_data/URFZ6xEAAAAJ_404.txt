Sugarcane production in the Burdekin region stands out from other crops/regions because it is fully irrigated and has the highest N fertiliser application rates of any sugarcane producing region in Australia. Few measurements of N losses from farms exist in the region and more complete information is needed to evaluate and develop future management recommendations to reduce environmental impacts of sugarcane production in the region. We measured water and N balances at three sites in different parts of the Burdekin region, covering a range of soil types and irrigation systems. The experimental data were then used to parameterise the APSIM-Sugarcane cropping systems model, and the model used to explore possible management strategies to reduce long-term nitrate losses at the three experimental sites. Measured nitrate losses in runoff (2-14 kg/ha/yr) were smaller than expected. A similar amount of nitrate was leached below the root-zone at sites with fine textured soil, but up to 10 times more was leached at the site with coarser textured soil. APSIM was parameterised to model crop growth, and the water and N balance (including runoff from furrow irrigation). Long-term simulations of different tillage, fallow and N fertiliser managements currently, or potentially practiced in the region identified opportunities for significantly reducing N losses, without reducing profitability, in these fully irrigated sugarcane systems."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2008/concurrent/agronomy-landscape/5852_thorburnpj.htm", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HTvrdRfWVFsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
