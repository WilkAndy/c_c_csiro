Sugarcane whole-crop total N and N 2 O gaseous emissions with and without trash for two different soil types (finer textured grey clay and coarser textured non-calcic brown soil) of Queensland, Australia, were simulated. Total denitrification losses over a whole crop were predicted to be between 40 and 60 kg N/ha, with almost all the losses occurring in the first four months of the crop. The losses were higher in the presence of trash and from finer textured grey clay soil. The presence of trash increased simulated losses more (25%) on the grey clay than the non-calcic brown soil (16%). Total N 2 ON emissions were predicted to be 18% of denitrification losses across both soils and trash treatments."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083147715", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qAZfOONSxyYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
