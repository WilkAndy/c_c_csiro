The Burdekin region potentially stands out from other regions because crops are large, fully irrigated and have large quantities of inputs applied to them. Hence the risk of off-site impacts may be high."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:a9-T7VOCCH8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6632231485268627678&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
