One suggested method for increasing the sequestration of carbon (C) within agricultural soils is to increase crop productivity and therefore C input into the soil. However, if enhanced production is achieved via nitrogenous fertilisers, there is a potential tradeoff between decreased C emissions and increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the increased soil C and nitrogen (N). An alternative is to incorporate leguminous crops into cereal cropping rotations to provide a biological source of N. However, the likely production of N2O from N released during the decomposition of leguminous residues is unknown as is the impact on C input into the soil when some cereal crops are replaced with grain legumes. Consequently, an analysis of the likely impacts has been undertaken for a subtropical dryland cropping system in Queensland \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6682210444329709204", "cites_id": ["6682210444329709204"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880909003764", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lG6tyP76u1wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 6, "2011": 8, "2012": 10, "2013": 11, "2014": 11, "2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 10, "2018": 4, "2019": 8, "2020": 5, "2021": 7, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
