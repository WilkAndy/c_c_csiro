Sugarcane in the Burdekin region stands out from other crops/regions because it is fully irrigated, and the irrigation may enhance the losses of chemicals from farms.Insufficient measurements of chemical losses from farms exist to develop soundlybased management recommendations to minimise environmental impacts of sugarcane production in the region. To provide this information, water, herbicide and nitrogen (N) losses have been monitored at three sites in different parts of the Burdekin region in collaboration with local grower groups."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:_FM0Bhl9EiAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7560893302806134432&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
