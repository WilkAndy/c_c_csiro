While subirrigation from water tables is practiced overseas, little is known about the potential water supply from shallow water tables in the Australian sugar industry. As farmers do not generally monitor for shallow water tables, the potential to increase irrigation water use efficiency is high given that shallow water tables are common through most sugarcane growing regions. Soil water potential measured with Campbell 229 probes showed little difference between the rainfed and fully irrigated treatment at depths below 0. 15 m, for a water table fluctuating between 0.57 and 1.45 m. The results suggest that surface applied irrigation can be greatly reduced where shallow water tables are within 1 m of the surface. These findings are of particular significance for areas where irrigation water allocations are below the sugarcane crops water requirements."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/2003/p/4/sweeney.htm", "cites_per_year": {}}
