Farmers should account for the contribution of this N to crop requirements in order to avoid over-fertilisation. In very wet tropical locations, the climate may increase the rate of trash decomposition as well as the amount of N lost from the soil\u2013plant system due to leaching or denitrification. A field experiment was conducted on Hydrosol and Ferrosol soils in the wet tropics of northern Australia using 15N-labelled trash either applied to the soil surface or incorporated. Labelled urea fertiliser was also applied with unlabelled surface trash. The objective of the experiment was to investigate the contribution of trash to crop N nutrition in wet tropical climates, the timing of N mineralisation from trash, and the retention of trash N in contrasting soils. Less than 6% of the N in trash was \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C", "num_citations": 113, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5279138061183011275", "cites_id": ["5279138061183011275"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10705-006-9015-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:y8kOuRhEQ0kJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 1, "2006": 0, "2007": 4, "2008": 4, "2009": 2, "2010": 8, "2011": 13, "2012": 6, "2013": 14, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 8, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 9, "2021": 12, "2022": 1, "2023": 3}}
