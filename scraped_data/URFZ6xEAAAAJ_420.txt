In the Babinda Mill region, where this situation is most acute, it has been hypothesised that a part of the low CCS problem is due to the effect of GCTB in increasing soil moisture and soil fertility, which aggravates lodging and suckering in the crop and restricts the opportunity for drying crops out. During the 1990\u2019s Babinda growers were assessing alternative management systems to overcome some of these perceived problems associated with trash blanketing. This project aimed to implement best-bet initiatives to overcome problems associated with trash blanketing, and so improve productivity and profitability in a wet tropics environment. The project was directed by stakeholders and conducted using a participative approach. There were four interrelated \u2018strands\u2019 of activity undertaken in this project: 1. Liaison and interaction with Babinda growers and the wider industry, achieved through establishment of a Grower Management Group, conducting all trials on farms (as opposed to research stations), distributing regular newsletters and holding regular bus tours and shed meetings to view demonstration sites and discuss trial results. 2. Demonstration of \u2018best-bet\u2019 trash management practices (for improved profitability). Trials were established on four farms comparing the impact of raking trash from the stool and/or incorporating it into the soil. 3. Exploration of improved nitrogen fertiliser placement (for improved profitability). Trials were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/13253", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZNO-_2r7rTwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
