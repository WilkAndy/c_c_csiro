These include rising water tables, water logging, salinisation, and ground and surface water pollution. Addressing these issues in a meaningful way will require greater understanding and better management of the storage, transport and fate of both the water and solutes (salts, nutrients and chemicals) associated with irrigation. Studies currently underway suggest there are gains to be made by recognising that water and solutes move differently in soils, and that benefits can accrue by taking advantage of these differences. We use simulation analysis to highlight some of these differences, which are generated by interacting effects of capillarity and gravity on water, and hence on mobile non-adsorbed solutes such as nitrates. We use our results to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?list=BRO&pid=procite:b20de5b9-c98a-44e8-9895-9c708d1266ef", "cites_per_year": {}}
