Queensland coastal regions depend upon groundwater for irrigation and urban supply and the groundwater also has direct links to surface waters and marine environments. Therefore, any contamination that impacts on groundwater is undesirable. Temporal analysis was used to determine trends of nitrate contamination of groundwaters and their implications in the regions of Mackay and Burdekin. In 1997. nitrate concentrations in 397 bores in the Burdekin and 165 bores in the Mackay regions were determined, and bores with nitrate concentrations greater than 20 mg/L (56 and 34 bores respectively) were subsequently resampled eight times, from October 1998 to June 2000. In Mackay. nitrate concentrations in l5% of the bores fell while nitrate concentrations in 12% rose.
