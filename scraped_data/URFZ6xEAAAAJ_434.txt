Critics have argued that such models (i) cannot be adequately \u2018parameterised\u2019,(ii) cannot be \u2018validated\u2019,(iii) use inappropriate descriptions of physical processes, and (iv) confer dubious advantages over simpler conceptual models. In this paper we refer to the key problems we faced in applying one such model, Topog, to predict the water, salt and carbon balance of the Kyabram plantation.We highlight problems in model parameterisation and reality-checking and conclude that uncertainty will always surround predictions obtained using models of this kind. However, we argue that these problems do not necessarily de-base complex models and that they can be used to test a variety of hypotheses of plantation hydrologic function. We stress the need for improved field measurement techniques and continued experimentation, proceeding hand in hand with model application and testing."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:UuEBAcK4md4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/publications/99-036.pdf#page=38", "cites_per_year": {}}
