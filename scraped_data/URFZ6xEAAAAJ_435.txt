The trees would provide a direct financial return to the grower through wood production, and lead to lower water tables through groundwater being used for transpiration. The feasibility of this concept depends on achievable growth rates (closely related to tree water-use), the extent of the beneficial effect of the trees on surrounding agricultural land (watertable control benefits) and on the sustainability of this system (potential for salt accumulation beneath the trees through concentrated water uptake).The net benefits, and potential problems, are likely to be site specific. The physical characteristics at a location (such as soil permeabilities, groundwater salinities, and depth to groundwater) combine with climatic conditions to determine how the trees interact with the groundwater system. What is desirable is that the trees use of groundwater be managed to balance salt accumulation, lowering of the groundwater table, and maximising growth rates. One possibility for managing this is in tree planting density; which could be location specific and even altered with time."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/publications/99-036.pdf#page=29", "cites_per_year": {}}
