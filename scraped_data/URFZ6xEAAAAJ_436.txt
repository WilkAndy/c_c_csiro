The sustainability may be limited by the potential for salt accumulation beneath the trees through concentrated water uptake.Exhaustive experiments to test the plantation strategy are not possible due the long lead time, and the number and variety of environmental conditions which need assessing. The use of strategically designed experiments together with a model capable of simulating the processes is therefore an essential contribution to our understanding of the system. An ecohydrological model (TOPOG_Dynamic) has been developed to predict the three dimensional water, plant carbon, and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agrifutures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/publications/99-036.pdf#page=37", "cites_per_year": {}}
