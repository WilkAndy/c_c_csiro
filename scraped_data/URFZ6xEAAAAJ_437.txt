However, this is not always the case. The benefits arc only captured if a system is tailored to soil type and crop demand. This paper revicws the current information available in the national and international literature on the productivity of sugarcane under trickle irrigation systcms, with particular attention water and nitrogen management. Early research showcd few advantages of trickle irrigation. However, studies published since the mid-1980s have shown yield increases of 5%\u201320%, although these increases do not necessarily persist through ratooning. A small number of studies have found irrigation usc efficiency has increased by 50%\u201380% under trickle irrigation. Scheduling methods have not bcen fully investigated, so only a broad range of optimum crop \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14504022227565712857&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2ZVs0F6jSMkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
