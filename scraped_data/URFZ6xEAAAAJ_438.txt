Increased concentration of salts in the root zone will not only limit water availability, but may also interfere with the uptake of nutrients, such as nitrogen, through either ionic or osmotic effects. At a highly saline site in south-east Queensland, natural abundance stable isotopes have been used to determine the soil sources of both water and nitrogen used by Casuarina glauca planted at the site, including the role of nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen nutrition of the trees. At this site, the dominant source of water for C. glauca originated from the groundwater table, with an annual average of greater than 60% of tree water derived from this source. However, on a monthly basis this proportion varied considerably. Trees readily utilised large summer rainfall events. But showed a smaller, or delayed response, to winter rainfall events. Soil nitrogen levels (combined NH{sub 4}, and NO{sub 3} ) ranged widely between plots, with the majority of soil nitrogen present in the upper soil layers. The availability of soil N to plants was estimated using the ion exchange resin bag techniques with results reflecting the influence of soil moisture and leaching events on NH{sub 4} and NO{sub 3} availability. Tree {delta}{sup 15}N signatures reflected soil N availability, with enriched values in high N soils. Soil {delta}{sup 15}N signatures were compared to those of trees to determine whether nitrogen was acquired from mineral sources or through nitrogen fixation"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:-FonjvnnhkoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/354004", "cites_per_year": {}}
