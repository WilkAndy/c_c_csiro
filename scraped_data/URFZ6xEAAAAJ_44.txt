In this paper we report testing of a new concept for N management in sugarcane, the N Replacement system. This system relies on soil N cycling to \u2018buffer\u2019 differences in crop N needs and N fertiliser supply to individual crops, and aligns N applications with actual cane production over the longer-term rather than potential production. In 11 experiments, conducted in a wide range of environments over two to five crops, cane and sugar yields in the N Replacement treatment were similar to those achieved with the farmers\u2019 conventional N management, with a trend over successive crops for yields to increase relative to conventional management. At sites where experiments ran for at least 4 years, this trend resulted in cumulative sugar yields being higher in the N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC", "num_citations": 111, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2386228206688733896", "cites_id": ["2386228206688733896"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-010-0406-2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:yAqzROmVHSEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 4, "2011": 1, "2012": 8, "2013": 17, "2014": 4, "2015": 7, "2016": 12, "2017": 12, "2018": 10, "2019": 10, "2020": 10, "2021": 8, "2022": 5, "2023": 3}}
