SER. 1996.", "abstract": "An analytical model, based on unsaturated-zone water and solute balances, was developed to describe the uptake of saline groundwater by plants in dry regions. It was assumed that: (i) initially, the profile was virtually dry and salt-free to some depth; (ii) both water and solutes move upwards from the water table by piston flow due only to plant water extraction; (iii) the uptake of water concentrates solutes in the soil solution until some threshold salinity is reached, above which plants can no longer extract water due to osmotic effects; (iv) uptake of the groundwater does not affect the water table level; and (v) uptake of groundwater is not limited by 'evaporative demand'. Model predictions were compared with measurements of groundwater uptake made over 15 months at five sites in Eucalyptus forest in a semi-arid area. Depth and salinity of groundwater and soil type varied greatly between sites.
