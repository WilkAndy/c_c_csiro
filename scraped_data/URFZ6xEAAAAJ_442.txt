It is also associated with water tables within 1 m of the surface, with electrical conductivity less than 6 dS per m; and with large amounts of lime in the soil. Drainage is often impractical as a response to salinity because of low soil permeability and insufficient outfall. Well-chosen pasture species, as well as replanting trees, may reduce recharge to groundwaters. Water balance models show that most recharge comes from summer rains, especially when winter crops are alternated with summer fallows; such crop management should be avoided in intake areas."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU9101422", "cites_per_year": {}}
