Substantial amounts of N fertiliser (~ 150 kg ha-1) is applied to sugarcane so total emissions may also be high (eg~ 5 kg N2 ON ha-1).\u2022 These emissions are of general concern because of their high impact on global warming. They are of also particular concern for sugarcane production because of the wide interest in the crop for biofuel production.\u2022 Aims:"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:jmjb1lOE9QIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.globaldndc.net/images/Documents/MC2/PO4c_Thorburn_P.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9fe2odKGewsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
