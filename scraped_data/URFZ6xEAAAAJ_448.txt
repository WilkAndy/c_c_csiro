However, most monitoring system lacks the consideration of sensor data quality control. The sensor data missing, background noises and signal interference have long been a huge obstacle for the users in understanding and analysing the sensor data, therefore makes the utilisation of sensor data much inefficient. We proposed an deep learningbased data imputation system for water quality sensor data. The model is based on the state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture and deployed on the Amazon Sagemaker service. It was tested in the 1622\u2122 WQ real-time water quality monitoring platform and can be a promising approach for data quality control in wireless sensor networks."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.ivivan.com/papers/SSCI2020.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4X0-otqJ8NgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
