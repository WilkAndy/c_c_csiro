This is an acute problem in Australia, where the condition of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) ecosystems is threatened by increased pollutant loads from agricultural lands, and Governments have enacted policies to reduce pollutant exports. These policies raise the question of how to identify changes in land management that will effectively reduce exports. The scale of the GBR catchments (> 400,000 km2) precludes detailed modelling investigations, especially within the time scale of policy implementation. Therefore, we developed conceptual frameworks linking agricultural land management to river pollutant exports for two contrasting agricultural pollutants posing threats to the health of GBR ecosystems; dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and fine sediment (silt and clay), based on a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC", "num_citations": 110, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1450603553156914613", "cites_id": ["1450603553156914613"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880912000059", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tV3W9z6UIRQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 11, "2014": 13, "2015": 11, "2016": 12, "2017": 9, "2018": 13, "2019": 9, "2020": 10, "2021": 10, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
