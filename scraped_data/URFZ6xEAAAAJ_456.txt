DSSs can be described as knowledge intensive innovations, because they require people to learn new knowledge and skills to operate the technology effectively and adopt its \u2018outputs\u2019. There has been a move to employing participatory action research (PAR) techniques in the application of DSSs, in an attempt to increase their generally low impact. The shift towards participatory application of agricultural DSSs opens opportunities for new ways of thinking about application process. The sociology of both science and technology describes how science and technology are produced through social relationships and practices, and so might inform and guide participatory DSS application.
