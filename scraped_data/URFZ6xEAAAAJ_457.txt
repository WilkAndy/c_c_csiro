However, if this is achieved via nitrogenous fertilisers, there is a potential tradeoff between decreased carbon emissions and increased nitrous oxide emissions (N2O) due to the increased soil carbon and nitrogen. An alternative is to incorporate leguminous crops into cropping rotations to provide a biological source of nitrogen. However, the likely impacts on carbon input and nitrous oxide emission when replacing cereal crops with legumes is unknown. Consequently, an analysis of the likely impacts has been undertaken for a subtropical dryland cropping system in Queensland, Australia where soil, climate and management are conducive to denitrification losses."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://globaldndc.net/images/Documents/MC2/PO4d_Huth_N.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:o-rfg80czv0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
