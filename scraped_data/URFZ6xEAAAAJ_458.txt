However, applying N increases losses of N to the environment, and so all intensive agricultural industries face the challenge of maintaining productivity while minimising environmental impacts of N fertiliser use. This challenge has become particularly important for sugarcane production in Australia because community concern grows over the impact of N on the health of the Great Barrier Reef and sugarcane production has the largest use of N fertiliser in the region.It has been suggested that replacing the N lost from a crop through harvested cane and environmental losses will better align N fertiliser applications to the actual needs of sugarcane crops and the other potential sources of N available to the crop, and so improve the financial and environmental \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17862563078134902942&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:njA9ynqS5PcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
