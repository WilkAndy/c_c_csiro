Employing an irrigation management strategy that makes use of this water will increase irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and potentially reduce groundwater recharge from irrigated fields. This paper describes a simulation study undertaken to identify the degree to which shallow water tables reduce the response in sugarcane yields to irrigation. Sugarcane was chosen as water is the major limitation to sugarcane production and little is known about the influence of shallow fresh water tables on irrigation in that industry. Data on the response of sugarcane yield to differing irrigation applications were obtained from two experiments. Yields in these experiments were simulated with the APSIM-Sugarcane model parameterised to represent a water table in the root zone. Measured yields were simulated accurately \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17219130178070490995&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:c68Zhaqj9u4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
