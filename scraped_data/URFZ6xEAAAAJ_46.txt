First, most methods give poor estimates when a consecutive number of data are missing. Second, some methods reconstruct missing data based on other parameters monitored simultaneously. When all the data are missing, these methods are no longer effective. Third, the performance of deep learning methods relies highly on a massive number of training data. Moreover in many scenarios, it is difficult to obtain large volumes of data from wireless sensor networks. Hence, we propose a new sequence-to-sequence imputation model (SSIM) for recovering missing data in wireless sensor networks. The SSIM uses the state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence deep learning \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:g5Ck-dwhA_QC", "num_citations": 109, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14985262898530500092", "cites_id": ["14985262898530500092"], "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8681112/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_D3A_DVZ9s8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 5, "2020": 16, "2021": 34, "2022": 38, "2023": 14}}
