As in all countries, climate is one of the most important determinants of production in sugarcane farming. This is particularly so in Fiji because the entire crop is rainfed, that is grown without the moderating effects of irrigation water supplies. It is therefore essential to understand the impact of climatic patterns that effect sugarcane and sugar yields in Fiji, and develop management options to moderate some of the negative impacts of climatic variability, and capitalise on positive events.The climate of this region is strongly modulated by the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, and this leads to significant interannual variability in the frequency of many extreme weather types, such as tropical cyclones and associated storm surge, floods and droughts in the region. Today, climate models are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14222072150167338270&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Hj2z0ETzXsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
