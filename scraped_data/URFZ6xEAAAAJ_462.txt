As a result there is impetus to consider diversifying products from the raw sugar production value chain. The chain is complex however, and alternative products will necessitate substantial changes to the chain, the impacts of which will be difficult to predict a priori. Modelling offers insights into the impacts of, and benefits from changes to value chains. Analyses of the chain should, ideally, be conducted in enough biophysical detail to allow the logistical challenges to be properly analysed. The application of these modelling techniques in a participatory environment would allow groups within mill regions to more thoroughly evaluate diversification options of their sugar value chains in their region, and so move forward with more confidence and greater understanding \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3736193443061311731&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:8yjQKSSg2TMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
