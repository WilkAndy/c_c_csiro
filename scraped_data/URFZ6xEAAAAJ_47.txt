It is believed that deep-rooted perennial plants in these areas are able to reduce recharge and use shallow groundwater, thus controlling groundwater levels. Lysimeters represent the best experimental technique for investigating capillary upflow from shallow water tables and the associated processes of salt accumulation, plant water use, and growth response. Techniques involving stable isotopes of water help determine the components of upflow due to vegetation. When combined with models that stimulate salt and water movement in the soil zone and the plant water use and growth, we can thoroughly test our understanding of salinity processes and the ability of plants to control water tables.
