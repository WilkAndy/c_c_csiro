This is considered a more sustainable system, but relatively little is known about its effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). As part of a study to understand the effects of trash retention on soil C and N dynamics, we measured the composition and decomposition of sugarcane trash in terms of dry matter (DM), C, and N in 5 field experiments in contrasting climatic conditions in Queensland and New South Wales. The trash from newly harvested sugarcane contained large quantities of DM (7\u201312\u2009t/ha) and C (3\u20135\u2009t/ha), which could be estimated from cane yield, and significant quantities of N (28\u201354\u2009kg/ha), which could not be predicted from cane yield. Trash quality was low (C\u2009:\u2009N\u2009 ratio >70) and it took a year for most of the trash to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 106, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14880061438535103602", "cites_id": ["14880061438535103602"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR06079", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cnTfVwqZgM4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 5, "2008": 1, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 5, "2012": 7, "2013": 14, "2014": 5, "2015": 7, "2016": 6, "2017": 11, "2018": 8, "2019": 7, "2020": 10, "2021": 7, "2022": 2, "2023": 3}}
