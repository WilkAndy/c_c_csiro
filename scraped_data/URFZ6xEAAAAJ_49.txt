These studies usually find large variability between individual models but that the ensemble mean (e\u2010mean) and median (e\u2010median) often seem to predict quite well. However, few studies have specifically been concerned with the predictive quality of those ensemble predictors. We ask what is the predictive quality of e\u2010mean and e\u2010median, and how does that depend on the ensemble characteristics. Our empirical results are based on five MME studies applied to wheat, using different data sets but the same 25 crop models. We show that the ensemble predictors have quite high skill and are better than most and sometimes all individual models for most groups of environments and most response variables. Mean squared error of e\u2010mean decreases monotonically with the size \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC", "num_citations": 103, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14217557002951345423", "cites_id": ["14217557002951345423"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.14411", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:D0XILsToTsUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 1, "2019": 10, "2020": 31, "2021": 17, "2022": 34, "2023": 8}}
