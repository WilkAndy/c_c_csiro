Therefore, accuracy of simulation results is a major concern. Studies with ensembles of crop models can give valuable information about model accuracy and uncertainty, but such studies are difficult to organize and have only recently begun. We report on the largest ensemble study to date, of 27 wheat models tested in four contrasting locations for their accuracy in simulating multiple crop growth and yield variables. The relative error averaged over models was 24\u201338% for the different end\u2010of\u2010season variables including grain yield (GY) and grain protein concentration (GPC). There was little relation between error of a model for GY or GPC and error for in\u2010season variables. Thus, most models did not arrive at accurate simulations of GY and GPC by accurately simulating preceding growth \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 447, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14200799504100019853", "cites_id": ["14200799504100019853"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12768", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jc5s8OhfE8UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 24, "2016": 37, "2017": 73, "2018": 49, "2019": 55, "2020": 52, "2021": 59, "2022": 69, "2023": 26}}
