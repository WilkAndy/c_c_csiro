The technique used in this study monitored the stable isotope composition of water from tree sap and different possible water sources. However, a detailed analysis of isotope data and measurement of soil water status was used to provide insights into the water relations of Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The study not only addresses an important ecological problem but also provides an example of the power of isotopic methods for studying plant-water sources. Naturally occurring differences in the concentration of the stable isotopes D and 18O were used to determine the sources of water transpired by E. camaldulensis. The comparison of tree sap and creek water \u03b4D and \u03b4 18O data showed that creek water is not the dominant source of water for trees flooded \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC", "num_citations": 98, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8492855191323420764", "cites_id": ["8492855191323420764"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080918013500428", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XCiqp8yu3HUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1993": 4, "1994": 2, "1995": 4, "1996": 3, "1997": 1, "1998": 4, "1999": 5, "2000": 2, "2001": 2, "2002": 2, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 4, "2006": 6, "2007": 2, "2008": 3, "2009": 2, "2010": 5, "2011": 4, "2012": 6, "2013": 0, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 9, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 4, "2020": 4, "2021": 0, "2022": 2}}
