Furthermore, there is a need for utilizing all available satellite imagery in identifying general land cover types and monitoring their changes through time irrespective of their spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions. Therefore, in this study, we developed deep learning models able to efficiently and accurately classify cloud, shadow and land cover scenes in different high-resolution (<10\u202fm) satellite imagery. Specifically, we trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to perform multi-label classification of multi-modal, high-resolution satellite imagery at the scene level. Multi-label classification at the scene level (a.k.a. image indexing), as opposed to the pixel level, allows for faster performance, higher accuracy \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C", "num_citations": 96, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12386270726928896525", "cites_id": ["12386270726928896525"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271619302023", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:DZJq0pnf5KsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 2, "2020": 31, "2021": 29, "2022": 25, "2023": 8}}
