Sugarcane is the dominant crop in most catchments draining into the GBR lagoon, especially those of the Mackay Whitsunday region (8400 km2) where sugarcane represents > 99% of cropping in the catchments, and is grown with large applications of N fertiliser. As farmers and farming systems adapt to a future requiring lower environmental impact, the question arises whether climate change may influence the effectiveness of these changes, an issue rarely considered in past water quality studies. To address this question we used the APSIM farming-systems model to investigate the complex interactions between a factorial of five proposed sugarcane management systems, three soil types \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9280210663507201834", "cites_id": ["9280210663507201834"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911003641", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ko8jB27uyYAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 2, "2013": 6, "2014": 11, "2015": 14, "2016": 12, "2017": 6, "2018": 10, "2019": 7, "2020": 7, "2021": 9, "2022": 6, "2023": 4}}
