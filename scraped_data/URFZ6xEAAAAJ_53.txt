It is one of Australia's premier sugar producing districts with approximately 40,000ha of land under sugarcane. Because the BD borders the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), industry, community, regulatory, and environmental organisations are interested in ascertaining the magnitude of deep drainage and nitrate leaching from the root zone and potential implications for the GBRWHA. Direct measurement of deep drainage and nitrate leaching is difficult, and modelling is likely to play an ever-increasing role in guiding experimental work and decision-making. Here, we describe the collection of drainage and nitrate-leaching related data collected over two cropping seasons at a specific field site within the BD and its use in the calibration and application of a drainage and nitrate-leaching model created \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C", "num_citations": 95, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1098189169896447413", "cites_id": ["1098189169896447413"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377405002076", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:td3bRzuNPQ8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 6, "2008": 8, "2009": 7, "2010": 6, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 10, "2014": 5, "2015": 9, "2016": 5, "2017": 8, "2018": 2, "2019": 3, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2, "2023": 4}}
