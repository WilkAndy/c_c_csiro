This study explored if additional measurements on water extracted from roots could indicate the activity of roots in different areas of the soil profile and their influence on canopy water sources, so providing advantages over more common sampling strategies. Studies were conducted on trees and shrubs located in diverse habitats: a saline, semi-arid floodplain, a subhumid mountain-range front and a cold desert. At each site, roots, soil immediately surrounding the roots, and plant stems were sampled. Roots were taken from different depths in the soil, to approximately 2 m at one site. Overall, 80% of roots sampled had H isotope ratios different from the surrounding soil. The differences up to 37\u2030, were significant (p<0.05) at two \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC", "num_citations": 91, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8292573600838296785", "cites_id": ["8292573600838296785"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00010129", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:0aS_B8EjFXMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1996": 2, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 7, "2000": 3, "2001": 1, "2002": 4, "2003": 2, "2004": 4, "2005": 1, "2006": 3, "2007": 5, "2008": 2, "2009": 4, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 5, "2013": 6, "2014": 2, "2015": 2, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 4, "2019": 4, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 2}}
