It was assumed that: i. initially, the profile had low water and salt contents to some depth; ii. both water and solutes move upwards from the water table by piston flow due only to plant water extraction; iii. the uptake of water concentrates solutes in the soil solution until some threshold salinity is reached, above which plants can no longer extract water due to osmotic effects; iv. uptake of the groundwater does not affect the water table level; and v. uptake of groundwater is only limited by transmission of groundwater through the soil. Model predictions were compared with measurements of groundwater uptake made over 15 months at five sites in aEucalyptus forest in a semi-arid area, using independently measured model parameters.
