Recently, there has been a shift towards more participatory processes in development and application of DSSs to enhance their end-user use. Apart from increasing adoption, these participatory processes are also likely to enhance co-learning resulting from development/application of DSSs. Learning is a valuable process in increasing sustainability of natural resource management, so the application of DSSs in a learning context can make a contribution to the global challenges faced by agriculture. We developed a framework, using concepts drawn from social studies of science and technology, describing the phases of the participatory DSS development/application process and its likely outcomes. We analysed experiences \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 81, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10491399878126907137", "cites_id": ["10491399878126907137"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14735903.2011.582359", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Aa9UdJrwmJEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 8, "2014": 5, "2015": 8, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 12, "2019": 4, "2020": 7, "2021": 6, "2022": 9, "2023": 3}}
