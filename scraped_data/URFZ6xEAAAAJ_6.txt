However, soil water and solute transport properties and soil profile characteristics are often not adequately incorporated in the design and management of trickle systems. In this paper, we describe results of a simulation study designed to highlight the impacts of soil properties on water and solute transport from buried trickle emitters. The analysis addresses the influence of soil hydraulic properties, soil layering, trickle discharge rate, irrigation frequency, and timing of nutrient application on wetting patterns and solute distribution. We show that (1) trickle irrigation can improve plant water availability in medium and low permeability fine-textured soils, providing that design and management are adapted to account for their soil hydraulic properties, (2) in highly permeable \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC", "num_citations": 432, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9622638284210003172", "cites_id": ["9622638284210003172"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00271-003-0080-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5FxpXIl6ioUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2003": 3, "2004": 2, "2005": 10, "2006": 11, "2007": 16, "2008": 11, "2009": 13, "2010": 14, "2011": 19, "2012": 28, "2013": 40, "2014": 24, "2015": 35, "2016": 39, "2017": 25, "2018": 30, "2019": 28, "2020": 25, "2021": 23, "2022": 24, "2023": 9}}
