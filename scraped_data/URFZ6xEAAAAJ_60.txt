Ecological risk is defined as the product of the likelihood of an effect occurring and the consequences if that effect was to occur."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7262494558777697370,9663534440209045459,5167410790941999694", "cites_id": ["7262494558777697370", "9663534440209045459", "5167410790941999694"], "pub_url": "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/50119/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WuQmp1KQyWQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 9, "2019": 11, "2020": 18, "2021": 19, "2022": 17, "2023": 5}}
