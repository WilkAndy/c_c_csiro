This would have implications for fertilizer requirements and water use. The recovery of nutrients (N, Ca, Mg, P, K, and S) and dry matter (DM) from burnt trash were quantified in a series of seven field experiments in Queensland, Australia, and by ignition of small samples of trash in a furnace (at 600 C and 900 C). The nutrient and DM recoveries after the fires ranged from 5-77% of their initial inputs. The lowest recoveries were after fires in standing cane crops. Recoveries of K were consistently the greatest (23-77%), while those of Ca (11-41%) and N (5-48%) were generally the lowest. Nutrient and DM recoveries after a standing crop was burnt in the field before harvest were: K (30%), DM (23%), P (23%), N (23%), S (18%), Mg (17%), Ca (11%). The data presented in this paper therefore indicate substantial additional quantities of these nutrients may be retained when residues are not burnt. Recoveries of all nutrients (except K) in residues tended to be linearly related to recoveries of DM. These data of DM and nutrient recovery after fires in sugarcane, indicate their retention only in the immediate area of the fire. Redeposition within areas predominantly burning cane would effectively increase recoveries and reduce net nutrient export."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C", "num_citations": 80, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17255386733899609267", "cites_id": ["17255386733899609267"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20001912598", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:s_QSwM9yd-8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 3, "2004": 4, "2005": 6, "2006": 0, "2007": 6, "2008": 2, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 7, "2012": 4, "2013": 6, "2014": 4, "2015": 6, "2016": 5, "2017": 5, "2018": 3, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
