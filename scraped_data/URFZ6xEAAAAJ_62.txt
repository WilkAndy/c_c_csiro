Using LiDAR and imaging sensors mounted on multirotor UAVs, we can observe fine-scale crop variations that can help improve fertilizer management and maximize yields. In this study we used UAV mounted LiDAR and multispectral imaging sensors to monitor two sugarcane field trials with variable nitrogen (N) fertilization inputs in the Wet Tropics region of Australia. From six surveys performed at 42-day intervals, we monitored crop growth in terms of height, density and vegetation indices. In each survey period, we estimated a set of models to predict at-harvest biomass at fine scale (2 m\u00d7 2 m plots). We compared the predictive performance of models based on multispectral predictors only, LiDAR predictors only, a fusion of multispectral and LiDAR predictors, and a normalized \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18092389669173922415", "cites_id": ["18092389669173922415"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243420303457", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:bwoP6YsUFfsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 3, "2021": 24, "2022": 32, "2023": 18}}
