Producers will need to adapt to climate change if they, and the communities dependent on them, are to remain viable. There are essentially two ways to adapt\u2014incrementally and transformationally. We differentiate between incremental and transformative adaptation mostly on the basis of the size of the change needed. Here, we studied the Australian peanut industry, which is already experiencing the effects of climate change. We expand on the notion of adaptive capacity and refer to \u2018transformational capacity\u2019 and test its association with resource dependency. Resource dependency is a measure of the interactions that primary producers have with a natural resource and includes factors such as occupational identity, networks, resource use as well as a range of financial factors. We hypothesized that some primary producers were more likely to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 77, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3765612855576097982", "cites_id": ["3765612855576097982"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-013-0186-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:vvRB6vAkQjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 1, "2015": 5, "2016": 12, "2017": 8, "2018": 14, "2019": 10, "2020": 7, "2021": 10, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
