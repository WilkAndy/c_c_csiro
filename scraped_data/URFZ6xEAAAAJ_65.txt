Recharge was calculated from soil chloride data, using a simple transient solute mass balance model.Clearing had a substantial initial effect on groundwater recharge, with average recharge rates of 29 to 70 mm year\u22121 in two cleared catchments, compared with 7 mm year\u22121 in an uncleared catchment. These results were attributed to record high rains that fell while both cleared catchments were bare of vegetation, before crops or pastures were established. The effect was only short lived, however, with no significant recharge occurring in any of the three catchments during the period in which crops and pastures were fully established. This lack of recharge was contrary to the general belief that clearing \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 73, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6507484122438780956", "cites_id": ["6507484122438780956"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169491900053", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HEh1y1Q6T1oJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1991": 1, "1992": 5, "1993": 3, "1994": 3, "1995": 1, "1996": 3, "1997": 2, "1998": 0, "1999": 3, "2000": 1, "2001": 3, "2002": 3, "2003": 6, "2004": 1, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 3, "2008": 1, "2009": 2, "2010": 1, "2011": 4, "2012": 4, "2013": 3, "2014": 4, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
