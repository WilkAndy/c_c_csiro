The objective of this study was to assess the use of global climate models (GCMs) and a crop simulation model for predicting climate change impacts on sugarcane production. The Canegro model was used to simulate growth and development of sugarcane crops under typical management conditions at three sites (irrigated crops at Ayr, Australia; rainfed crops at Piracicaba, Brazil and La Mercy, South Africa) for current and three future climate scenarios. The baseline scenario consisted of a 30-year time series of historical weather records and atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) set at 360 ppm. Future climate scenarios were derived from three GCMs and [CO2] set at 734 ppm. Future cane yields are expected to increase at all three sites, ranging from +4 % for Ayr, to +9 and +20 % for Piracicaba \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC", "num_citations": 70, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14278761976542939808", "cites_id": ["14278761976542939808"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12355-013-0274-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:oEoylF1aKMYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 9, "2019": 9, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 10}}
