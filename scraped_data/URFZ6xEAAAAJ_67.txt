Complexity arises from inherently complex plant and soil processes combined in an almost infinite set of permutations and combinations associated with biotic and abiotic drivers that are inherently variable in both space and time. Modelling has evolved over the last 100 years as a means of describing and interpreting complex and variable performance and increasingly as a means of predicting likely performance in prescribed circumstances for better decision making. In this paper we reflect on the evolution of quantitative approaches to describing and predicting crop growth and cropping system performance. We begin with early mathematical descriptions of plant and crop growth and soil processes dating from the 1920\u2032s to 1950\u2032s. We explore the early crop models of the 60\u2032s and 70\u2032s and the more comprehensive crop-soil \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:ziOE8S1-AIUC", "num_citations": 69, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12839149965495148839", "cites_id": ["12839149965495148839"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S116103011830087X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:J6FOb97SLbIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 8, "2020": 18, "2021": 21, "2022": 13, "2023": 7}}
