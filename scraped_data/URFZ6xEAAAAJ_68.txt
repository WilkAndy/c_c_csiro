By coupling with climate and crop model emulators, IAMs have the potential to resolve important agricultural feedback loops and identify unintended consequences of socioeconomic development for agricultural systems. Here we propose a framework to develop robust representation of agricultural system responses within IAMs, linking downstream applications with model development and the coordinated evaluation of key climate responses from local to global scales. We survey the strengths and weaknesses of protocol-based assessments linked to the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), each utilizing multiple sites and models to evaluate crop response to core climate \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C", "num_citations": 67, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13146737941910889327", "cites_id": ["13146737941910889327"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa8da6/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:b6O_9oCYcrYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 12, "2019": 12, "2020": 11, "2021": 14, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
