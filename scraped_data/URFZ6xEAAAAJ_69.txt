In Australia it is generally accepted that inorganic N fertiliser applied to the sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) crop in the first year (termed the plant crop) following a \u2018good\u2019 legume fallow crop that is not harvested can be substantially reduced, or even eliminated. However, current recommendations do not consider the carry over of legume N to crops beyond the plant crop (termed ratoons), for which standard N fertiliser rates are considered necessary. Based on a simple field experiment extending the duration of a soybean (Glycine max L.) fallow and two sugarcane crops (plant and first ratoon), cropping system simulation was used to provide a first estimate of how long and how much soybean N \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC", "num_citations": 65, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3174472280652421081", "cites_id": ["3174472280652421081"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429010002042", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:2ZecXbj9DSwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 3, "2013": 7, "2014": 3, "2015": 2, "2016": 7, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 7, "2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
