Here we show that grid-based and point-based simulations and statistical regressions (from historic records), without deliberate adaptation or CO2 fertilization effects, produce similar estimates of temperature impact on wheat yields at global and national scales. With a 1\u2009\u00b0C global temperature increase, global wheat yield is projected to decline between 4.1% and 6.4%. Projected relative temperature impacts from different methods were similar for major wheat-producing countries China, India, USA and France, but less so for Russia. Point-based and grid-based simulations, and to some extent the statistical regressions, were consistent in projecting that warmer regions are likely to suffer more yield loss with increasing temperature than cooler regions. By forming a multi-method ensemble, it \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:zCSUwVk65WsC", "num_citations": 431, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16647978807583078996", "cites_id": ["16647978807583078996"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3115", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:VHo4ToWACecJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 30, "2018": 47, "2019": 60, "2020": 83, "2021": 84, "2022": 93, "2023": 32}}
