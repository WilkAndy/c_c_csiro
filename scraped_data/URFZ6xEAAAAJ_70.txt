Literature concerning shallow water table contributions to sugarcane crops has been summarised, and an assessment of required irrigation for water tables to depths of 2m investigated using the SWIMv2.1 soil water balance model for three different soils. The study was undertaken because water availability is a major limitation for sugarcane and other crop production systems in Australia and knowledge on how best to incorporate upflow from water tables in irrigation scheduling is limited. Our results showed that for the three soils studied (representing a range of permeabilities as defined by near-saturated hydraulic conductivities), no irrigation would be required for static water tables within 1m of the soil surface. Irrigation requirements when static water tables exceeded 1m \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 61, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13107717107808140595", "cites_id": ["13107717107808140595"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377403002075", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M_02C0P357UJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 1, "2005": 1, "2006": 2, "2007": 3, "2008": 4, "2009": 1, "2010": 2, "2011": 6, "2012": 4, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 6, "2016": 7, "2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 3, "2022": 4}}
