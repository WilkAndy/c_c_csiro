Improved management of coastal catchment resources is needed to remediate this serious and growing problem through, e.g. agricultural land use and management practice change. This may, however, be very costly and, consequently, there is a need to explore how water quality improvement can be achieved at least cost. In the present paper, we develop an environmental\u2013economic modelling approach that integrates an agricultural production system simulation model and a catchment water quality model into a spatial environmental\u2013economic land-use model to explore patterns of land use and management practice that most cost-effectively achieve specified water \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2974509284656695369", "cites_id": ["2974509284656695369"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/mf08346", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:SUgQTW-URykJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 7, "2010": 4, "2011": 4, "2012": 8, "2013": 7, "2014": 5, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 5, "2019": 2, "2020": 0, "2021": 4, "2022": 1}}
