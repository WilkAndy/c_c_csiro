More than half these soils are irrigated with groundwater, some of which has high salinity (electrical conductivity > 2.9 mS cm\u22121). A simple prediction of salt leaching was sought to aid in land management decisions.An empirical model of leaching fraction is presented based on rainfall and easily measured soil properties related to hydraulic conductivity. The model is based on data from 766 soils. To account for the complexity of interactions between soil properties, the data was stratified into groups based on clay content and mineralogy (expressed here as CEC/clay ratio). This allowed simple linear regressions using ESP and rainfall to be developed to predict leaching fraction.When applied to irrigated soils, a salinity correction term (ECrain+irrigation/ECrain) was used to account for the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 60, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16679352596673587753", "cites_id": ["16679352596673587753"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00251556", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Keo30ND2eOcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1986": 2, "1987": 1, "1988": 1, "1989": 2, "1990": 3, "1991": 1, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 3, "1995": 0, "1996": 1, "1997": 0, "1998": 1, "1999": 0, "2000": 1, "2001": 1, "2002": 1, "2003": 6, "2004": 4, "2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 1, "2010": 1, "2011": 2, "2012": 4, "2013": 1, "2014": 2, "2015": 0, "2016": 4, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 2, "2020": 1, "2021": 2, "2022": 2}}
