Each model simulated 1981\u20132010 grain yield, and we evaluate results against the interannual variability of growing season temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The amount of information used for calibration has only a minor effect on most models' climate response, and even small multi-model ensembles prove beneficial. Wheat model clusters reveal common characteristics of yield response to climate; however models rarely share the same cluster at all four sites indicating substantial independence. Only a weak relationship (R2 \u2264 0.24) was found between the models' sensitivities to interannual temperature variability and their response to long-term \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC", "num_citations": 59, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2947645996096564350", "cites_id": ["2947645996096564350"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481521630072X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fizwiGok6CgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 9, "2018": 11, "2019": 9, "2020": 8, "2021": 8, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
