As sugarcane is the dominant cropping system in GBR catchments, its N management practises are coming under increasing scrutiny. This study measured dissolved inorganic N lost in surface runoff water and sugarcane productivity over 3years. The experiment compared the conventional fertiliser N application rate to sugarcane (average 180kgN/ha/year) and a rate based on replacing N exported in the previous crop (average 94kgN/ha/year). Dissolved inorganic N losses in surface water were 72%, 48% and 66% lower in the three monitored years in the reduced N fertiliser treatment. There was no significant difference in sugarcane yield between the two fertiliser N treatments, nor any treatment difference in soil mineral N \u2013 both of these results are indicators of the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 58, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17943994122925115076", "cites_id": ["17943994122925115076"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X12001014", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:xAamXJXfBfkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 5, "2013": 8, "2014": 3, "2015": 3, "2016": 7, "2017": 4, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 5, "2021": 4, "2022": 5, "2023": 2}}
