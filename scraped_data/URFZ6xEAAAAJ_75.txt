As a common framework for all studies, we define prediction uncertainty as the distribution of prediction error, which can be written as the sum of a bias plus a predictor uncertainty term that represents the random variation due to uncertainty in model structure, model parameters or model inputs. Several themes recur in many of the studies: Use of multi-model ensembles (MMEs) to quantify model structural uncertainty; Emphasis on uncertainty in those inputs related to prediction of regional results or climate change impact assessment; Simultaneous consideration of multiple sources of uncertainty; Emphasis on exploring the variability of uncertainty over space or time; Use of sensitivity analysis \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC", "num_citations": 57, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18122100160413159554", "cites_id": ["18122100160413159554"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S116103011730076X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:gtB5tRSifvsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 2, "2019": 5, "2020": 15, "2021": 12, "2022": 14, "2023": 8}}
