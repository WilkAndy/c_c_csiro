The major emphasis is on the uncertainty of the predictions, and in particular on the estimation of mean squared error of prediction. Three contributions to mean squared error are considered. The first is parameter uncertainty that results from model calibration. To take proper account of the complex data structure, generalized least squares is used to estimate the parameters and the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimators. The second contribution is model structure uncertainty, which we estimate using two different models. An ANOVA analysis is used to separate the contributions of parameter and model uncertainty to mean squared error. The third contribution is model error, which is estimated using hindcasts. Mean squared error of prediction of time from emergence to maturity, for baseline +2 \u00b0C, is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC", "num_citations": 56, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11966757792122081492", "cites_id": ["11966757792122081492"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1161030116301022", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1BCTMM92EqYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 9, "2019": 3, "2020": 8, "2021": 11, "2022": 13, "2023": 5}}
