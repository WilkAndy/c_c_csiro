Observations that N moves more slowly than water through the soil profile has resulted in different approaches being used to simulate impeded N movement in crop models:(i) by accounting for nitrate N O 3\u2212 adsorption to the soil,(ii) by considering incomplete mixing between resident and draining soil water fractions or (iii) a combination of both. We compare and discuss strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Our inability to directly measure model parameters (especially with regards to simulating N dynamics), and the risk of compensating errors during model testing and calibration, often results in low confidence in simulated N leaching. We caution that our current ability to simulate N leaching is in most cases not yet well enough \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C", "num_citations": 54, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5185971580312866004", "cites_id": ["5185971580312866004"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377413003041", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1MzRA61F-EcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2014": 2, "2015": 5, "2016": 6, "2017": 7, "2018": 7, "2019": 3, "2020": 5, "2021": 11, "2022": 4, "2023": 3}}
