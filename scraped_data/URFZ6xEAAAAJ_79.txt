Enormous amounts of water quality data are collected by advanced sensors, which leads to an interest in using data-driven models for predicting trends in water quality. However, the unpredictable background noises introduced during water quality monitoring seriously degrade the performance of those models. Meanwhile, artificial neural networks (ANN) with feed-forward architecture lack the capability of maintaining and utilizing the accumulated temporal information, which leads to biased predictions in processing time series data. Hence, we propose a water quality predictive model based on a combination of Kernal Principal Component Analysis (kPCA) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to forecast the trend of dissolved oxygen. Water quality variables are reconstructed based on the kPCA method, which aims to reduce the noise from the raw sensory data and preserve actionable information. With the RNN\u2019s recurrent connections, our model can make use of the previous information in predicting the trend in the future. Data collected from Burnett River, Australia was applied to evaluate our kPCA-RNN model. The kPCA-RNN model achieved R2 scores up to 0.908, 0.823, and 0.671 for predicting the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the upcoming 1, 2 and 3 hours, respectively. Compared to current data-driven methods like Feed-forward neural network (FFNN), support vector regression (SVR) and general regression neural network (GRNN), the predictive accuracy of the kPCA-RNN model was at least 8%, 17% and 12% better \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12741995345769167711", "cites_id": ["12741995345769167711"], "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/646406", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:X3tAykGp1LAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 6, "2021": 18, "2022": 22, "2023": 6}}
