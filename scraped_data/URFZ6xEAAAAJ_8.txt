Nitrate pollution of groundwaters in coastal Northeastern Australia is of particular concern because of its proximity to environmentally sensitive areas (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef) and the large number of people (in cities and rural areas) relying on groundwaters for drinking water. This study determined the extent of nitrate contamination in groundwater in this region based on information from 1454 wells, and examined the likely source of the nitrate by comparing \u03b4 15N  values of groundwaters to those of possible industrial or organic nitrogen contaminants. In wells where nitrate concentrations were elevated, and therefore, likely to be a result of human activities, concentrations were subsequently monitored to provide an assessment of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C", "num_citations": 401, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11090458600806274081", "cites_id": ["11090458600806274081"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788090200018X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:IdQ7cVY56ZkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2002": 1, "2003": 5, "2004": 9, "2005": 15, "2006": 16, "2007": 13, "2008": 17, "2009": 17, "2010": 28, "2011": 17, "2012": 24, "2013": 24, "2014": 30, "2015": 23, "2016": 34, "2017": 21, "2018": 19, "2019": 25, "2020": 19, "2021": 18, "2022": 20, "2023": 1}}
