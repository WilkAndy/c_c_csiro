We hypothesize that the use of a crop model as an in-season forecast tool will improve current N decision-making. To explore this, we used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) calibrated with long-term experimental data for central Iowa, USA (16-years in continuous corn and 15-years in soybean-corn rotation) combined with actual weather data up to a specific crop stage and historical weather data thereafter. The objectives were to: (1) evaluate the accuracy and uncertainty of corn yield and economic optimum N rate (EONR) predictions at four forecast times (planting time, 6th and 12th leaf, and silking phenological stages); (2) determine whether the use of analogous historical weather years based on precipitation and temperature patterns as opposed to using a 35-year dataset could improve the accuracy of the forecast; and (3) quantify the value added by the crop model in predicting annual EONR and yields using the site-mean EONR and the yield at the EONR to benchmark predicted values. Results indicated that the mean corn yield predictions at planting time (R2 = 0.77) using 35-years of historical weather was close to the observed and predicted yield at maturity (R2 = 0.81). Across all forecasting times, the EONR predictions were more accurate in corn-corn than soybean-corn rotation (relative root mean square error, RRMSE, of 25 vs. 45%, respectively). At planting time, the APSIM model predicted the direction of optimum N rates (above, below or \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:3bvyWxjaHKcC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4741251745124565850", "cites_id": ["4741251745124565850"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00436/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WsPZildPzEEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 13, "2020": 9, "2021": 16, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
