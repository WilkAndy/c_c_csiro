There is considerable interest in increasing SOC concentration in agro-ecosystems worldwide. In some agro-ecosystems, increased SOC has been found to enhance the provision of ecosystem services such as the provision of food. However, increased SOC may increase the environmental footprint of some agro-ecosystems, for example by increasing nitrous oxide emissions. Given this uncertainty, progress is needed in quantifying the impact of increased SOC concentration on agro-ecosystems. Increased SOC concentration affects both N cycling and soil physical properties (i.e., water holding capacity). Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the contribution, both positive and negative, of increased SOC concentration on ecosystem services provided by wheat agro-ecosystems. We used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to represent the effect of increased SOC concentration on N cycling and soil physical properties, and used model outputs as proxies for multiple ecosystem services from wheat production agro-ecosystems at seven locations around the world. Under increased SOC, we found that N cycling had a larger effect on a range of ecosystem services (food provision, filtering of N, and nitrous oxide regulation) than soil physical properties. We predicted that food provision in these agro-ecosystems could be significantly increased by increased SOC concentration when N supply is limiting. Conversely, we \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10720525593609699358", "cites_id": ["10720525593609699358"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00731/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:HgCXRDr1xpQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 6, "2019": 5, "2020": 12, "2021": 12, "2022": 10, "2023": 6}}
