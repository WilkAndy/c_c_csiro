To represent these CO2 responses, commonly used crop simulation models have been amended, using simple and semicomplex representations of the processes involved. Yet, there is no standard approach to and often poor documentation of these developments. This study used a bottom\u2010up approach (starting with the APSIM framework as case study) to evaluate modelled responses in a consortium of commonly used crop models and illuminate whether variation in responses reflects true uncertainty in our understanding compared to arbitrary choices of model developers. Diversity in simulated CO2 responses and limited validation were common among models, both within the APSIM framework and more generally. Whereas production responses show \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC", "num_citations": 52, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13615403261107296636", "cites_id": ["13615403261107296636"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13600", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fNn-4yCh87wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 3, "2018": 8, "2019": 6, "2020": 12, "2021": 11, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}
