Climate change may exacerbate current production constraints. Crop models can help quantify the potential impact of climate change on maize yields, but a comprehensive multimodel assessment of simulation accuracy and uncertainty in these low\u2010input systems is currently lacking. We evaluated the impact of varying [CO2], temperature and rainfall conditions on maize yield, for different nitrogen (N) inputs (0, 80, 160 kg N/ha) for five environments in SSA, including cool subhumid Ethiopia, cool semi\u2010arid Rwanda, hot subhumid Ghana and hot semi\u2010arid Mali and Benin using an ensemble of 25 maize models. Models were calibrated with measured grain yield, plant biomass, plant N, leaf area index, harvest index and in\u2010season soil water content from 2\u2010year experiments in each country to assess \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:BmWJbWwHJAwC", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14781042411465084815,8371001971406150006", "cites_id": ["14781042411465084815", "8371001971406150006"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15261", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:jw9cicLPIM0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2020": 4, "2021": 11, "2022": 28, "2023": 8}}
