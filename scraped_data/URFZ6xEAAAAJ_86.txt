The model has algorithms that mechanistically connect biochar to soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water, bulk density (BD), pH, cation exchange capacity, and organic and mineral nitrogen. Soil moisture (SW)\u2013temperature\u2013nitrogen limitations on the rate of biochar decomposition were included as well as biochar\u2010induced priming effect on SOC mineralization. The model has 10 parameters that capture the diversity of biochar types, 15 parameters that address biochar\u2010soil interactions and 4 constants. The range of values and their sensitivity is reported. The biochar model was connected to APSIM's maize and wheat crop models to investigate long\u2010term (30 years) biochar effects on US maize and Australia wheat in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC", "num_citations": 50, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17520610656559145439", "cites_id": ["17520610656559145439"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcbb.12314", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:36EhYJC2JfMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 2, "2016": 3, "2017": 7, "2018": 11, "2019": 3, "2020": 9, "2021": 6, "2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
