However, past studies show that discharge may vary greatly between soils in agricultural areas and salt flats for similar water table depths. Low discharge from salt flats has been previously attributed to the effect of salt crusts, yet possible soil hydrological reasons for those differences have not been examined. Steady-state hydraulic theory describing the relationship between discharge and water table depth is reviewed. The minimum water table depths required for the theory to be applied are defined in terms of soil parameters. Relationships between discharge and water table depth are then used to analyse the results of previous diffuse discharge studies. It is shown that discharge from both bare agricultural soils and salt flats is consistent with this theory.
