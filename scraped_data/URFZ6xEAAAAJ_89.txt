CO2 increase to 540 ppm partially compensates yield losses due to increased temperatures. Accounting for soil feedbacks is critical when evaluating climate change impacts on crop yield. A critical omission from climate change impact studies on crop yield is the interaction between soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) availability, and carbon dioxide (CO2). We used a multimodel ensemble to predict the effects of SOC and N under different scenarios of temperatures and CO2 concentrations on maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in eight sites across the world. We found that including feedbacks from SOC and N losses due to increased temperatures would reduce yields by 13% in wheat and 19% in maize for a 3\u00b0C rise temperature with no adaptation practices. These losses correspond to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3794245185890213765", "cites_id": ["3794245185890213765"], "pub_url": "https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2134/ael2018.05.0026", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hd-4z-TdpzQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 9, "2020": 14, "2021": 9, "2022": 12, "2023": 1}}
