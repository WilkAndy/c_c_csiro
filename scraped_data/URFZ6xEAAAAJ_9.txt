Sugarcane root systems are commonly depicted as comprising highly branched superficial roots, downward-oriented buttress roots and deeply penetrating agglomerations of vertical roots known as rope roots. It is unclear how common rope systems are in modern sugarcane cultivars. Root distributions for sugarcane show the expected exponential decline with depth, with maximum values for root length density as high as 5cmcm\u22123. Observations from the 1930s suggested maximum root depth could exceed 6m and there is evidence of root activity below 2m, from use of 32P as a tracer and observed changes in soil water content. There is little information available on root turnover in sugarcane, but evidence shows that the root system is not completely replaced when ratooning \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC", "num_citations": 379, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15949293226565827128", "cites_id": ["15949293226565827128"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429005000298", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OPr_w69FV90J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2005": 2, "2006": 0, "2007": 2, "2008": 8, "2009": 14, "2010": 14, "2011": 26, "2012": 16, "2013": 22, "2014": 27, "2015": 17, "2016": 32, "2017": 35, "2018": 31, "2019": 25, "2020": 33, "2021": 28, "2022": 27, "2023": 13}}
