Nitrogen loads are examined using the nitrogen surplus of simulated sugarcane production systems in the Tully\u2013Murray catchment, comparing current management practice regimes with best management practice regimes under present day and future climate scenarios \u2013 nominally 2030 and 2070. These future scenarios are represented by increased carbon dioxide, increased temperature and increased rainfall variability. Simulation results suggest that the impact of potential climate change on diffuse agricultural nitrogen loads from sugarcane production in the Tully\u2013Murray catchment to the Great Barrier Reef is likely to be small and negligible in comparison to the impacts of management practice change. Partial gross margin analysis suggests climate change will not noticeably alter the profitability of sugarcane \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC", "num_citations": 47, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11542724295779584184", "cites_id": ["11542724295779584184"], "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/mf/MF08348", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:uIg2Tpf-L6AJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 2, "2010": 2, "2011": 1, "2012": 1, "2013": 5, "2014": 6, "2015": 5, "2016": 5, "2017": 3, "2018": 4, "2019": 5, "2020": 3, "2021": 5}}
