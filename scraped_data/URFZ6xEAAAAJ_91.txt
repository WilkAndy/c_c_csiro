In the agricultural sector, practices that mitigate GHG emissions include those that (1) reduce emissions [e.g., those that reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by avoiding excess nitrogen (N) fertilizer application], and (2) increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (e.g., by retaining instead of burning crop residues). Sugarcane is a globally important crop that can have substantial inputs of N fertilizer and which produces large amounts of crop residues (\u2018trash\u2019). Management of N fertilizer and trash affects soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and hence GHG emissions. Trash has historically been burned at harvest, but increasingly is being retained on the soil surface as a \u2018trash blanket\u2019 in many countries. The potential for trash retention to alter N fertilizer requirements and sequester SOC was investigated in this study. The APSIM model was calibrated with data from field and laboratory studies of trash decomposition in the wet tropics of northern Australia. APSIM was then validated against four independent data sets, before simulating location \u00d7 soil \u00d7 fertilizer \u00d7 trash management scenarios. Soil carbon increased in trash blanketed soils relative to SOC in soils with burnt trash. However, further increases in SOC for the study region may be limited because the SOC in trash blanketed soils could be approaching equilibrium; future GHG mitigation efforts in this region should therefore focus on N fertilizer management. Simulated N fertilizer rates were able to be reduced from conventional rates regardless of trash management, because of low yield \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:buQ7SEKw-1sC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17831997050259881657", "cites_id": ["17831997050259881657"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01017/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ub6N2Nb6d_cJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 6, "2019": 6, "2020": 8, "2021": 4, "2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
