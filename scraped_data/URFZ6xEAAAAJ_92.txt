Impacts such as reduced regional productivity may, for example, threaten farm profitability as well as the viability of the whole agricultural value chain in the region. This paper expands on existing studies, by quantifying not only the private (farm-scale) but also the likely direct social (regional-scale) impacts of water quality improvement \u2013 thus informing policy by identifying potential social consequences of private actions required to achieve sustainable load targets. We use the Environmental Economic Spatial Investment Prioritization model to explore the medium to long term private and social impacts of land use and management practice change for water quality improvement. By incorporating these economic drivers of social change we avoid \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC", "num_citations": 44, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2498715229493189468", "cites_id": ["2498715229493189468"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911002040", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:XNvMMEM4rSIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2012": 5, "2013": 5, "2014": 5, "2015": 4, "2016": 4, "2017": 6, "2018": 4, "2019": 3, "2020": 0, "2021": 1, "2022": 3, "2023": 2}}
