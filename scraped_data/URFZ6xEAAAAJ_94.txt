The health of the GBR is under pressure from sediments, pesticides and nutrients (especially nitrogen) discharged from nearby catchments. Discharge of nitrogen is of particular concern as it stimulates outbreaks of the Crown of Thorns Starfish, a major predator of GBR corals. Recent research has shown that the amount of nitrogen fertiliser applied in excess of crop uptake is an important determinant of nitrogen discharge from catchments, so increasing the efficiency of nitrogen use in cropping systems is an important step in protecting the economic and ecological benefits provided by the GBR. Importantly, an increase in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) also offers opportunities to improve productivity and profitability of agricultural industries, with such benefits a major incentive for industry adoption and practice change. The Australian sugarcane industry is a significant contributor to the anthropogenic loads of nitrogen entering the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, with recent estimates in the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (2013) suggesting it contributes 18% and 56% of particulate and inorganic nitrogen loads, respectively. A focus on improving NUE in the Australian sugar industry to reduce these loads wherever possible is a logical outcome from these statistics. While the relative impact of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and particulate nitrogen (PN) is still uncertain, recent NUE forums in the sugar industry in 2014 identified clear target reductions in DIN that would be \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13773130972462204298", "cites_id": ["13773130972462204298"], "pub_url": "https://elibrary.sugarresearch.com.au/handle/11079/14735", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ikWKcqX9I78J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 3, "2017": 10, "2018": 5, "2019": 5, "2020": 4, "2021": 7, "2022": 6, "2023": 1}}
