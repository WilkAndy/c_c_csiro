Hill ex Maiden. trees at two sites (1) to compare results from the two techniques and (2) to assess the impact of the assumptions underlying the deuterium tracing method on the calculation of sap flow for a range of tree sizes. The trees ranged in height from 4 to 14 m with leaf areas of 5 to 35 m2. In all trees, sap flow estimated by the deuterium tracing technique was higher than sap flow estimated by the heat pulse method, with differences of 11 to 43% in eight of the trees and 113% in one tree. The largest difference was attributed to errors in the heat pulse method, as indicated by aberrant relationships between sap flow measured by the heat pulse method and tree size characteristics (i.e., diameter, sap wood area, leaf area) for that tree compared with the other experimental trees \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11517124044924352626", "cites_id": ["11517124044924352626"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-abstract/18/10/697/1620200", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:cnjTa0wL1Z8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2001": 2, "2002": 1, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 2, "2006": 3, "2007": 0, "2008": 2, "2009": 1, "2010": 4, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 2, "2015": 1, "2016": 2, "2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 3, "2021": 1, "2022": 0, "2023": 1}}
