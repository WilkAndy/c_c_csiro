(1979) were applied to soil chloride data from 42 sites in Queensland, Australia, to evaluate utility of the models for assessing the impact of irrigation on soil salinity and leaching. Data were taken from previous studies on salinity in irrigated soils, and covered a wide range of soil types and irrigation managements. The time taken for soil chloride levels to reach steady-state was assessed from the transient model, and was calculated to be years (> 3) or decades. These calculations showed that 19 sites had been sampled prior to steady-state, so that a strict application of the LR model was invalid. However, at only seven of these sites were there significant differences between sampled soil chloride and the calculated final values. At these seven sites leaching fluxes calculated with the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1308117313606178106,13307176173273547237", "cites_id": ["1308117313606178106", "13307176173273547237"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00190534", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:OtUIGsRdJxIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"1990": 3, "1991": 2, "1992": 1, "1993": 0, "1994": 0, "1995": 0, "1996": 4, "1997": 1, "1998": 0, "1999": 2, "2000": 0, "2001": 1, "2002": 0, "2003": 2, "2004": 3, "2005": 1, "2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 0, "2009": 2, "2010": 0, "2011": 6, "2012": 2, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
