Over-application of N fertilizer is a rational reaction by growers to uncertainty about the size of the forthcoming crop and the negative impact of inadequate long-term N fertilizer applications on profitability. New fertilizer management strategies have been developed that provide greater site-specificity, an important consideration for growers. This paper seeks to identify concepts that may be the basis of further improvements in N fertilizer management. While sustained under application of N fertilizer undoubtedly reduces profitability, there is considerable evidence showing that greatly reducing N fertilizer applications for a single crop does not significantly reduce sugarcane production. Consequently, a new philosophy to N fertilizer management can be envisaged that removes the uncertainty driving growers' decisions to over-apply N. Rather than aiming to fertilize the coming crop, one could aim to replace the amount of N lost from the previous crop, the majority of which is in harvested cane and can be easily estimated. To better examine this new'replacement'N management strategy, long-term simulations were undertaken of a trash management experiment in Mackay. The replacement strategy had similar productivity, greater profitability and lower environmental N losses than conventional N fertilizer management. The'replacement'strategy is evidence \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 40, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11788374294038114065", "cites_id": ["11788374294038114065"], "pub_url": "https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20033076918", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Ee98g_a3mKMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2004": 2, "2005": 4, "2006": 1, "2007": 5, "2008": 3, "2009": 1, "2010": 6, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 3, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 0, "2017": 1, "2018": 3, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 3}}
