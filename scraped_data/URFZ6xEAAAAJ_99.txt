The review of literature pertaining to soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics within Australian grain farming systems does not enable us to conclude on the best farming practices to increase or maintain SOC for a specific combination of soil and climate. This study aimed to further explore the complex interactions of soil, climate, and farming practices on SOC. We undertook a modeling study with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator modeling framework, by combining contrasting Australian soils, climates, and farming practices (crop rotations, and management within rotations, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue management) in a factorial design. This design resulted in the transposition of contrasting soils and climates in our simulations, giving soil\u2013climate combinations that do not occur in the study area to help provide insights into the importance of the climate constraints on SOC. We statistically analyzed the model\u2019s outputs to determinate the relative contributions of soil parameters, climate, and farming practices on SOC. The initial SOC content had the largest impact on the value of SOC, followed by the climate and the fertilization practices. These factors explained 66, 18, and 15% of SOC variations, respectively, after 80 years of constant farming practices in the simulation. Tillage and stubble management had the lowest impacts on SOC. This study highlighted the possible negative impact on SOC of a chickpea phase in a wheat\u2013chickpea rotation and the potential \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "URFZ6xEAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10308214594697567382", "cites_id": ["10308214594697567382"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00661/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lhxyAY8iDo8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 7, "2018": 1, "2019": 3, "2020": 6, "2021": 11, "2022": 8, "2023": 2}}
