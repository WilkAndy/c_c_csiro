With the rapid increase in global plastics production and the resulting large volume of litter that enters the marine environment, determining the consequences of this debris on marine fauna and ocean health has now become a critical environmental priority, particularly for threatened and endangered species. However, there are limited data about the impacts of debris on marine species from which to draw conclusions about the population consequences of anthropogenic debris. To address this knowledge gap, information was elicited from experts on the ecological threat (both severity and specificity) of entanglement, ingestion and chemical contamination for three major marine taxa: seabirds, sea turtles and marine mammals. The threat assessment focused on the most common types of litter that are found along the world's coastlines, based on data gathered \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC", "num_citations": 276, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6218180081898559328", "cites_id": ["6218180081898559328"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X15002985", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:YBf50tZpS1YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 1, "2016": 8, "2017": 13, "2018": 26, "2019": 48, "2020": 52, "2021": 56, "2022": 52, "2023": 14}}
