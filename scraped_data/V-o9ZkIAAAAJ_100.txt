It is therefore imperative to increase our understanding of their distribution at sea, especially during winter. Although they are known to migrate to the north Pacific Ocean, until this study there was very little information available on timing of movements, distribution and habitat use of individuals. Ten to 16 flesh-footed shearwaters (37 in total) were tracked from Lord Howe Island in each of three winter seasons (2005, 2007 and 2008). All birds migrated to the north-west Pacific Ocean, with approximately 70% wintering to the east of Japan in the Kurashio and Oyashio currents, around the Bonin Islands in the north Philippine Sea, or in the eastern Sea of Japan. Others spent a varying amount of time in the Yellow and East China seas, or in the western \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC", "num_citations": 25, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8064133340425298022", "cites_id": ["8064133340425298022"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713001870", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZiBvKYyO6W8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 1, "2016": 3, "2017": 3, "2018": 3, "2019": 7, "2020": 1, "2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
