Current approaches can be resource intensive and sometimes controversial. Using Chile as an example, we present a structured process leveraging existing capacity, fisheries officers, that provides a monitoring tool to produce transparent and stand-alone estimates on the level, structure, and characteristics of illegal fishing. We provide a national illegal fishing baseline for Chile, estimating illegal activity for 20 fisheries, representing ~ 70% of annual national landings. For four fisheries, we also estimate the relative importance of illegal activities across sectors, stakeholders, and infrastructure. While providing new information, our results also confirm previous evidence on the general patterns of illegality. Our approach provides an opportunity for \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11791146128848473324", "cites_id": ["11791146128848473324"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69311-5", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7Ey8mO6QoqMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 9, "2022": 9, "2023": 6}}
