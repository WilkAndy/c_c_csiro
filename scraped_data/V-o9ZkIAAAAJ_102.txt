Pollution is varied, ranging from human-made plastics and pharmaceutical compounds, to human-altered abiotic factors, such as sediment and nutrient runoff. As global population, wealth and resource consumption continue to grow, so too does the amount of potential pollution produced. This presents us with a grand challenge which requires interdisciplinary knowledge to solve. There is sufficient data on the human health, social, economic, and environmental risks of marine pollution, resulting in increased awareness and motivation to address this global challenge, however a significant lag exists when implementing strategies to address this issue. This review draws upon the expertise of 17 experts from the fields of social sciences, marine science, visual arts, and Traditional and First Nations Knowledge Holders to \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:b1wdh0AR-JQC", "num_citations": 23, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6080237002553077294", "cites_id": ["6080237002553077294"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-021-09674-8", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Lq5c31ZXYVQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 5, "2022": 14, "2023": 4}}
