Historically, conservationists have either used indirect approaches, such as the promotion of alternate industries like eco\u2010tourism, or more recently direct approaches, such as land purchases and cash payments. While direct payment programs, through conservation incentive agreements and regular payments for ecosystem preservation, are being trialed in low\u2010income nations, the lack of enforceable property rights and contractual laws can present challenges when trying to influence conservation outcomes in local communities.
