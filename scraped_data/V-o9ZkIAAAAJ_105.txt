However, these tools often require time-consuming survey work to produce accurate maps. In particular, the large quantity of data necessary may be prohibitive for projects where determining bathymetry is not a central focus, but instead a necessary step in achieving some other goal. We present a method to produce bathymetric surface maps with a minimum amount of effort using global positioning system receiver and laser transit survey data. We also demonstrate that this method is surprisingly accurate, given the small amount of data we use to generate the bathymetry maps."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC", "num_citations": 22, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17044136494775124275", "cites_id": ["17044136494775124275"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002216940400318X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:M8FXmtbviOwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 3, "2013": 2, "2014": 3, "2015": 0, "2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 1, "2019": 2, "2020": 2, "2021": 2}}
