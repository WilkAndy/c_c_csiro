This environmental issue is garnering attention around the world, with the United Nations general assembly focusing on marine debris in 2015-2016. Furthermore, recent and upcoming changes in legislation have demonstrated significant changes in the public\u2019s relationship with plastic as plastic bag bans are enacted and microbead bans come into effect.As evidence of the public\u2019s increasing interest in addressing and responding to the issue, In 2014 alone, more than half a million volunteers in 91 countries picked up more than sixteen million pounds of trash as part of the International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) efforts. This annual effort led by the Ocean Conservancy, has long been supported by and has been working hand in hand with NOAA\u2019s Marine Debris Program. The NOAA program, initiated in 2006, is authorized by the United States Congress and is the Federal government\u2019s main program aimed at addressing marine debris related issues, with a mission of investigating and preventing the negative impacts of marine debris."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11277297233434079675", "cites_id": ["11277297233434079675"], "pub_url": "https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/publications-files/An_analysis_of_marine_debris_in_the_US_FINAL_REP.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:u3FViRUCgZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 10, "2020": 4, "2021": 5, "2022": 2}}
