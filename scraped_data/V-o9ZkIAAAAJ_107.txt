Diving behaviour in this species is typically diel in nature, with the majority of time during the day spent at depths of approximately 600\u2013800m and the majority of time at night spent in waters typically less than 200m. Descent into deep waters occurs at dawn and ascent into surface waters occurs at dusk. Diving behaviour such as this result in little light data being collected by archival tags deployed on this species and, as a consequence, calculated positions may be few and far between. This reduces the scale at which movement and habitat interaction can be inferred. Swordfish, however, do spend time right at the ocean surface at night and in some regions basking during the day also occurs. Periods of surface behaviour may provide the opportunity to determine position in this species utilising alternative \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13103487457292973633", "cites_id": ["13103487457292973633"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098110004545", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Qfa7ymrw2LUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 1, "2012": 4, "2013": 2, "2014": 4, "2015": 3, "2016": 1, "2017": 3, "2018": 1, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
