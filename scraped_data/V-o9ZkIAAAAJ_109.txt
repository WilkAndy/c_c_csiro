Here, we incorporate various forms of risk in a model of location choice by fishing vessels targeting broadbill swordfish, Xiphias gladius, and evaluate the importance of risk sensitivity for predicting location, perceived utility and profit over a fishing season. We consider short\u2010term, or trip\u2010level, risk as natural, social or endogenous. Longer\u2010term, or seasonal, risk includes accumulated profit as a state variable. When considering only short\u2010term risk, endogenous and social risks are predicted to have the largest impact on profit, while natural risk also is predicted to impact on location choice. When longer\u2010term (seasonal) risk was considered, the impacts of short\u2010term (trip\u2010level) risks on profit were reduced. Model results were somewhat sensitive to assumed input parameters.
