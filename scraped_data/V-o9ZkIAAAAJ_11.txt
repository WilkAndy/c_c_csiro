To date, however, there are few reports about the scale of waste entering the coastal and oceanic waters around Africa. To address this knowledge gap, existing information was collated on waste mismanagement that can become marine debris in Africa at the continental scale. This paper focuses on identifying sources and seeking solutions to waste mismanagement. Stories are shared about opportunities that have arisen and solutions that are taking place in several countries around Africa. Finally, impediments to success are discussed and sectors are described where investments can be made to significantly reduce this growing global problem."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=17121695270992123364", "cites_id": ["17121695270992123364"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305286", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:5JX4YyJ7nO0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 8, "2019": 14, "2020": 51, "2021": 53, "2022": 92, "2023": 30}}
