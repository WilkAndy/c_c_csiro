ALDFG raises a number of issues, including stock depletion for species targeted by the fishery, mortality to non-target species, which in some cases are species of conservation concern (Derraik, 2002; Wilcox et al., 2015), hazards to other vessels due to fouling of propellers or fishing gear, and costs for removal that are imposed on public agencies or other bodies (Macfadyen et al., 2009). Kim et al.(2016) explore biodegradable polymers as a possible solution to the issue, for passive fishing gear such as gillnets and trammel nets. These nets had only slightly lower catch rates than conventional nylon nets in field tests, and yet they showed clear signs of degradation within 2 years of introduction to salt water. While it is commendable that Kim et al.(2016) have developed a nylon substitute for fishing gear that degrades back to the monomer, and eventually the elemental level, leaving no plastic residue in the environment, there are a number of significant issues with the solution they propose, even for ALDFG in the Korean croaker fishery they use as a pilot study. First, the time required for the gear to degrade is likely far longer than the time it effectively fishes. A large study across a number of European gill net fisheries found that derelict gear lost its fishing capacity rapidly, declining to 20% within one to 4 weeks of being lost (Pawson, 2003). This is driven primarily by fouling of the net by currents \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13931323016059196660", "cites_id": ["13931323016059196660"], "pub_url": "https://www.bmis-bycatch.org/system/files/zotero_attachments/library_1/V6FG4AVN%20-%20Wilcox%20and%20Hardesty%20-%202016%20-%20Biodegradable%20nets%20are%20not%20a%20panacea,%20but%20can%20cont.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:9JRux3gAVsEJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 1, "2018": 1, "2019": 1, "2020": 5, "2021": 3, "2022": 4, "2023": 2}}
