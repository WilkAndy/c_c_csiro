While this project is focused on what we call \u2018marine debris\u2019, it might be better simply called \u2018debris\u2019 to encompass all anthropogenic litter. The data collected and the results presented here focus on land-based surveys and, accordingly, the land-based sources of the debris or litter recorded.The CSIRO and Australia Packaging Covenant project aimed to understand where littering and other losses of rubbish into the environment are occurring. The project specifically focused on the following main questions: 1) what is the relationship between debris in the marine environment and debris from nearby sites; and 2) are there identifiable pathways through which debris reaches and moves into the marine environment."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10864857740776423637", "cites_id": ["10864857740776423637"], "pub_url": "https://stormwaternsw.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Report-Marine-debris-sources-and-transport.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:1cAh_oy6x5YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 2, "2019": 1, "2020": 3, "2021": 4, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
