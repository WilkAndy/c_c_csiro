Technical solutions are often applied that may impose inefficiencies across the fleet, even in periods or areas when the risk of bycatch is low. These may include gear specifically designed to avoid the bycatch which may also reduce the targeted catch, or designation of marine protected areas that exclude fishing from whole areas. In this article, we examine the effectiveness of a variable penalty system that can provide incentives for fishers to redirect their effort away from problem areas. The system is examined using a case study of fishery, which is currently subjected to gear and closure controls to limit bycatch of turtles and seabirds. An alternative incentive-based management policy using a series of differential hook penalties has been proposed as a flexible tool to discourage vessels operating in certain areas \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16199535016047982474", "cites_id": ["16199535016047982474"], "pub_url": "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2012.736941", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ircKrkRP0OAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2013": 1, "2014": 1, "2015": 3, "2016": 2, "2017": 4, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
