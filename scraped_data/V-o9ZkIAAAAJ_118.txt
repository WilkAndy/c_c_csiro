However, detecting the use of these devices is a significant challenge for fisheries management in Indonesia. These devices are continually deployed at large scales, due to large numbers of users and high failure rates, increasing the difficulty of monitoring AFADs. To address this challenge, tracking devices were attached to 34 handline fishing vessels in Indonesia over a month period each. Given there are an estimated 10,000\u201350,000 unlicensed AFADs in operation, Indonesian fishing grounds provided an ideal case study location to evaluate whether we could apply spatial modeling approaches to detect AFAD usage and fish catch success. We performed a spatial cluster analysis on tracking data to identify fishing grounds and determine whether AFADs were in use. Interviews with fishers were \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15990988663816399465", "cites_id": ["15990988663816399465"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97227-1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:aSoTQndn690J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 8, "2023": 4}}
