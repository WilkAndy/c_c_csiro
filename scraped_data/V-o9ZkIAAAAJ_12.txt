Little theory exists, however, to assist managers in choosing the most cost\u2010effective monitoring techniques for diagnosing trend. We present a framework for determining the optimal monitoring strategy by simulating a manager collecting data on a declining species, the Chestnut\u2010rumped Hylacola (Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri), to determine whether the species should be listed under the IUCN (World Conservation Union) Red List. We compared the efficiencies of two strategies for detecting trend, abundance, and presence\u2013absence surveys, under financial constraints. One might expect the abundance surveys to be superior under all circumstances because more information is collected at each site. Nevertheless, the presence\u2013absence data can be collected at more sites because the surveyor is not obliged to spend a fixed amount \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C", "num_citations": 251, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10789134292515016579", "cites_id": ["10789134292515016579"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00529.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:g89Xy3m0upUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2007": 7, "2008": 18, "2009": 10, "2010": 19, "2011": 16, "2012": 23, "2013": 15, "2014": 22, "2015": 17, "2016": 11, "2017": 16, "2018": 12, "2019": 9, "2020": 15, "2021": 17, "2022": 15, "2023": 6}}
