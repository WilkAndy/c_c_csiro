The manuscript suggests varied toxicological interpretations and concluded that superficially healthy animals may still experience negative health consequences of ingesting plastic debris: an influential message with dire consequences for wildlife globally. While well intended, we posit that the interpretations reveal confounding and confirmation bias and highlight a growing trend within the field of plastic pollution and wildlife impacts. By evaluating recent publications, we provide a framework for assessing confounding and biases in plastic and wildlife research, and we reinterpret Lavers et al.\u2019s results to suggest a nutrition explanation. As bite-sized plastics increasingly invade our oceans, the past decade has seen a surge in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=18312825597786464226", "cites_id": ["18312825597786464226"], "pub_url": "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c02874", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:4h--Dds5JP4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 9, "2023": 4}}
