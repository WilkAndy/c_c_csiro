To effectively prevent and reduce ALDFG at source, an understanding of the major causes of and drivers behind fishing gear losses is required. We interviewed 451 fishers from seven countries around the world (Belize, Iceland, Indonesia, Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, and the United States of America) representing five key fishing gear types (gillnets, purse seine nets, trawl nets, longlines, and pots and traps) about why and under what circumstances they lose their gear. We also asked them their views on the most effective interventions to reduce gear losses. Across all major gear types and countries where interviews were undertaken, bad weather was the most common cause of gear loss, followed by interactions with wildlife (identified as a cause for loss by 81% and 65% of all fishers interviewed, respectively). Snagging gear on a bottom obstruction was a major cause of loss for gears that contact the seafloor, along with conflicts with other fishers, often via gear and vessel interactions, for gillnet and pot and trap fishers. Operational and behavioral characteristics such as gear type, trip length, and the party responsible to pay for gear repairs and replacements all significantly influenced gear losses. Gear maintenance was the most effective gear loss prevention measure across all gear types and countries reported by fishers, followed by training crew in gear management (identified as an effective prevention measure by 95% and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=12051244333432424050", "cites_id": ["12051244333432424050"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.690447/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:csat-96ePqcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 3}}
