We applied a risk assessment framework to explore the relative risk for 19 marine bird species posed by plastic debris in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We estimated exposure for each species by combining scores from (1) spatial overlap of predicted marine bird densities from habitat-association models and predicted density of marine plastics from terrestrial input and ocean circulation models, (2) species' foraging behavior, and (3) species' residence time in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We estimated sensitivity for each species by combining scores for (1) mortality/sub-lethal effects of ingested plastic debris, (2) off-loading of plastics via \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:KUbvn5osdkgC", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5330642022863883433", "cites_id": ["5330642022863883433"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720308016", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qUySRa0--kkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 4, "2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
