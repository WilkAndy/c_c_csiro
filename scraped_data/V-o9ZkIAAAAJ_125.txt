The CBD is one of the most highly supported of international environmental agreements, with over 190 signatory nations. Australia is one of these nations, and in 1996, in accordance with the CBD\u2019s requirements, all Australian State and Territory governments, as well as the Commonwealth Government, endorsed The National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia\u2019s Biological Diversity. Although in some ways a far-sighted document that has achieved significant advances in biodiversity conservation in Australia, we are concerned that many of the actions proposed in the 1996 strategy have been poorly implemented or not implemented at all over the last 12 years.The 1996 national strategy is about to be replaced, and a draft strategy, Australia\u2019s Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010\u20132020, has been widely circulated for public comment (Commonwealth of Australia 2009). The redraft was initiated under the Howard Government, and continued under the Rudd Government. The draft was open for public comment during April\u2013June 2009. We responded with a letter of concern to DEWHA signed by 90 scientists from around Australia. This document presents our collective concern\u2013even alarm\u2013that this critically important opportunity to strengthen and extend the principles and achievements of the 1996 national strategy (Commonwealth of Australia 1996) has not so far produced what we believe would be a visionary and effective new strategy.
