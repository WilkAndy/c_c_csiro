However, the origins and long-term population level consequences of these entanglements are usually unknown. Plastic entanglement could produce a combination of wounds, asphyxiation, or inability to feed that results in the death of a certain percentage of individuals from the total population. In this research, we report on the consequent effect of plastic entanglement on population growth demographics in a South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis australis) colony on Guafo Island, southern Chile. Using a stochastic matrix population model structured according to age and sex, and assuming an otherwise stable population, we explored population growth rates under five scenarios with differing rates of entanglement: A) a zero rate of plastic entanglement, B) entanglement rates (number of \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:oNZyr7d5Mn4C", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11628026086832747160", "cites_id": ["11628026086832747160"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749121004632", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mDKkOB4MX6EJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 2, "2022": 7, "2023": 2}}
