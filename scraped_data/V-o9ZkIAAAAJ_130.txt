Following this trend, Wilcox and Donlan (Front Ecol Environ 2007; 5 [6]: 325\u2013331) propose economically-based compensatory mitigation for marine bycatch (CMMB), in which lucrative fishing and associated bycatch are allowed to continue with compensatory fees paid to fund conservation actions on the terrestrial islands where some marine species breed. Wilcox and Donlan illustrate this approach with a seabird example but suggest CMMB is broadly applicable."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=14287434202058962419", "cites_id": ["14287434202058962419"], "pub_url": "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[350:CMFMBW]2.0.CO;2", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:87V9bbUpR8YJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2008": 1, "2009": 3, "2010": 3, "2011": 1, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
