Invasive plants reduce biodiversity and ecosystem productivity as well as having detrimental effects on ecosystem services to herbivores and humans (DiTomaso 2000).The economic costs of invasive species are similarly grave. Although the rising number of biotic invasions can be linked to increased global trade (Westphal et al. 2007), the worldwide costs of invasive plants, animals and microbes have been estimated at US $1.4 trillion, or 5% of global GDP (Pimentel et al. 2001). The economic cost of weeds on natural and agricultural systems within Australia has been estimated at AU $3.5-4.5 billion (Sinden et al. 2004). This creates an economic as well as environmental imperative to develop sound weed management strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16572228925600824951", "cites_id": ["16572228925600824951"], "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Mccarthy-24/publication/43479988_Optimal_management_of_an_annual_weed_A_stochastic_dynamic_programming_approach/links/0deec5294821157315000000/Optimal-management-of-an-annual-weed-A-stochastic-dynamic-programming-approach.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:d_7jhmdi_OUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 3, "2011": 2, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 0, "2021": 2}}
