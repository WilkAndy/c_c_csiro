Central to this is the need for precise global time series of plastic pollution with which we can assess whether implemented policies are effective, but at present we lack these data. To address this need, we used previously published and new data on floating ocean plastics (n = 11,777 stations) to create a global time-series that estimates the average counts and mass of small plastics in the ocean surface layer from 1979 to 2019. Today\u2019s global abundance is estimated at approximately 82\u2013358 trillion plastic particles weighing 1.1\u20134.9 million tonnes. We observed no clear detectable trend until 1990, a fluctuating but stagnant trend from then until 2005, and a rapid increase until the present. This observed acceleration of plastic densities in the world\u2019s oceans, also reported for beaches around the globe, demands urgent international policy interventions."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16001905291664035395", "cites_id": ["16001905291664035395"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281596", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 9}}
