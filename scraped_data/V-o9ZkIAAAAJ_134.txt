Management frameworks typically address incidental catch with fleet-level controls on fishing. Yet, individual operators differ in their fishing practices and efficiency at catching fish. If operators have differing abilities to target, they should also have differing abilities to avoid bycatch. We analysed variations in threatened species bycatch among individual operators from five industrial fisheries representing different geographic areas, gear types and target species. The individual vessel is a significant predictor of bycatch for 15 of the 16 cases, including species that represent high or low costs to fishers or have economic value as potentially targeted byproducts. Encouragingly, we found high-target and low-bycatch operators in all five sectors, including gears known for high \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1482676172790146811", "cites_id": ["1482676172790146811"], "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00865-0", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-6YXpB-GkxQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 5, "2023": 4}}
