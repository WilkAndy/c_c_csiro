Bio-banding reduced the within-bio-banded group variance for anthropometric values, when compared to an aggregated chronological banded group (chronological: 5.1\u201316.7%CV; bio-banded: 3.0\u201317.3%CV). Differences between these bio-banded groups ranged from moderate to very large (ES = 0.97 to 2.88). Physical performance variance (chronological: 4.8\u201324.9%CV; bio-banded: 3.8\u201326.5%CV) was also reduced with bio-banding compared to chronological aged grouping. However, not to the same extent as anthropometric values with only 68.3% of values reduced across banding methods compared to 92.6% for anthropometric data. Differences between the bio-banded groups physical qualities ranged from trivial to very large (ES = 0.00 to 3.00). The number of functional movement metrics and %CV reduced by bio-banding was lowest within the \u2018circa-PHV\u2019 groups (11.1\u201344.4%). The proportion of players achieving the threshold value score of \u2265 14 for the FMS\u2122 was highest within the \u2018post-PHV\u2019 group (50.0\u201353.7%). The use of maturity status bio-banding can create more homogenous groups which may encourage greater competitive equity. However, findings here support a bio-banding maturity effect hypothesis, whereby maturity status bio-banding has a heightened effect on controlling for characteristics which have a stronger association to biological growth."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2837909528582679906", "cites_id": ["2837909528582679906"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260136", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Yu3dK65HYicJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 6, "2023": 2}}
