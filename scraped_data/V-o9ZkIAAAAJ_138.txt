However, quantitative ALDFG estimates are dated and limited in scope. To provide current global estimates, we interviewed fishers around the world about how much fishing gear they lose annually and multiplied reported losses by global fishing effort data. We estimate that nearly 2% of all fishing gear, comprising 2963 km2 of gillnets, 75,049 km2 of purse seine nets, 218 km2 of trawl nets, 739,583 km of longline mainlines, and more than 25 million pots and traps are lost to the ocean annually. These estimates represent critical baselines that can inform solutions targeted to ALDFG reduction strategies."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3811525398151165482", "cites_id": ["3811525398151165482"], "pub_url": "https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.abq0135", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:KvYtwSdC5TQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 7}}
