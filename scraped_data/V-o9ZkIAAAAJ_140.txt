To understand the consequences of marine debris to wildlife populations, studies must go beyond reporting the incidence of wildlife and debris interactions and aim to quantify the harm resulting from these interactions. Tubenosed seabirds are globally threatened, with a near universal risk of debris ingestion and an unquantified risk of mortality due to eating plastics. In this paper, we explore the mortality risk narrative due to the acute effects of debris ingestion, and quantify behavioural and ecological factors including age, diet and foraging method. We examined ingested debris loads, types and mortality of 972 adult and immature seabirds across 17 albatross, shearwater and prion species in a global seabird biodiversity hotspot. Though age and foraging method interact to influence the incidence and number of items ingested, age and diet \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:tuHXwOkdijsC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6496892579740771127", "cites_id": ["6496892579740771127"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abcc8e/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:N-NRF2GZKVoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 3, "2022": 3, "2023": 1}}
