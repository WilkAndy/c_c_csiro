The authors misrepre? sent the use of biodiversity offsets as we presented them, misunderstand the policy objectives of fisheries (and by catch) management, present a flawed analysis of the ap? propriateness of offsets for seabirds and other marine megafauna, underestimate the cost of standard bycatch reduction measures, and overestimate the data require? ments involved in implementing offsets.? ydelis et al. set up a \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=1170417563541492084", "cites_id": ["1170417563541492084"], "pub_url": "https://www.jstor.org/stable/29738794", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dNHEqZIoPhAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 2, "2011": 0, "2012": 0, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 1, "2016": 1, "2017": 0, "2018": 2, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
