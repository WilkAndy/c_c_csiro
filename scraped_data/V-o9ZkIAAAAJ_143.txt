The loci were highly polymorphic, with five to 30 alleles per locus. Gene diversity, estimated as expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.364 to 0.851, and was generally matched by levels of observed heterozygosity (0.373\u20130.829). Cross\u2010species amplification trials with four other hydrobiid species associated with these southern mound springs showed that these primers will be useful for genetic analyses of these other endemic snails."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2221863434087864064", "cites_id": ["2221863434087864064"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2004.00877.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:AJc8eAWl1R4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2006": 1, "2007": 1, "2008": 1, "2009": 0, "2010": 0, "2011": 2, "2012": 1, "2013": 0, "2014": 0, "2015": 0, "2016": 0, "2017": 0, "2018": 1}}
