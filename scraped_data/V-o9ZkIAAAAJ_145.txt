In this study, the importance of catch rates per hook to location choice is assessed through the estimation of a nested multinomial logit model. Other variables in the model include distance to the location, prices of the main species, fuel prices and vessel characteristics. The effects of increasing hook penalties in key areas on fishing effort in those areas and elsewhere are assessed. Implications for vessel economic performance are also assessed."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=2252755368629158631", "cites_id": ["2252755368629158631"], "pub_url": "https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/59151/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:58L-eBJlQx8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2010": 1, "2011": 1, "2012": 2, "2013": 1, "2014": 0, "2015": 1}}
