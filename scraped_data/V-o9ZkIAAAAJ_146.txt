This large, shallow sea supports high-value fishing activities and habitat for threatened species, and is a sink for abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) \u2018ghost nets\u2019, most originating from fishing activities outside of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone. With growing concerns about the plastic waste along the world's coastlines, we retrospectively analyzed ghost net sighting information from four aerial surveys across 15 years, to investigate whether densities of ghost nets are changing through time or in space. We found an increase in ghost nets, despite more than a decade of illegal fishing countermeasure and clean-up efforts in the broader region. This demonstrates that the input of ALDFG into the system currently overwhelms the substantial net removal activities. We make recommendations for improving monitoring and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6901408357057591896", "cites_id": ["6901408357057591896"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X21009930", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:WHpU5FW6xl8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 4, "2023": 1}}
