Understanding plastic pollution risk from a systems perspective requires a way of 25 conceptualizing sources, distribution and dynamics in the environment; identifying or quantifying 26 impacts on wildlife, humans and other assets; and identifying and evaluating potential management 27 responses (Hardesty and Wilcox 2017). The uncertainties in our knowledge and the difficulty in 28 resolving them satisfactorily are challenging, given that we are confined to working with largely 29 observational data because experiments at scale are difficult or impossible. To advance our 30 understanding of the risk posed by anthropogenic debris, we suggest applying a conceptual 31 framework that allows us to break components into smaller parts that not only integrates 32 uncertainty, but also connects variables of interest to outcomes in which we are focused (sensu 33 Hardesty and Wilcox 2017; Koelmans et al. 2017). 34 35There are two fundamental components to risk. The first is the probability of an event happening 36 (exposure); the second is the severity of the event if it occurs (impact). While we have seen 37 improvements in understanding the risk of plastics exposure to marine taxa (Wilcox et al. 2015; 38 Wilcox et al. 2016; Schuyler et al. 2015), we know far less about the potential population, 39 community or species level impacts (Hardesty and Wilcox, 2017; Koelmans et al. 2017).
