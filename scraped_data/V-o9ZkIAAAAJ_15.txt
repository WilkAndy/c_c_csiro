While we do not doubt the potential benefits of using formal decision methods of this type, we draw attention to the consequences of not using them well. In particular, we highlight a property of these methods that should not be overlooked when they are applied in environmental and wider decision\u2010making contexts: the final decision or ranking of options is dependent on the choice of performance scoring scales for the criteria when the criteria weights are held constant. We compare this \u201csensitivity\u201d to a well\u2010known criticism of the AHP, and we go on to describe the more general lesson when it comes to using weighted linear average methods\u2014a lesson concerning the relationship between \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC", "num_citations": 219, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9111912465045249324", "cites_id": ["9111912465045249324"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01130.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:LN15JxwEdH4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2009": 4, "2010": 8, "2011": 9, "2012": 7, "2013": 17, "2014": 23, "2015": 22, "2016": 17, "2017": 13, "2018": 17, "2019": 19, "2020": 14, "2021": 19, "2022": 20, "2023": 9}}
