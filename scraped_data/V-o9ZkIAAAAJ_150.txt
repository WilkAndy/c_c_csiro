Separating simultaneous pressures is challenging and can require significant amounts of data over long periods of time. We use spatial contrasts to investigate the relative importance of several drivers for the purported decline in a species listed as in decline as an example species, the Flesh-footed shearwater (Ardenna carneipes). On Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, Australia, this seabird suffers from habitat loss due to housing development, intensive mortality in fisheries, plastic ingestion, and roadkill due to vehicular traffic on its breeding island. We repeated a quantitative survey of the population to ascertain whether the decline previously reported had continued and to evaluate the purported mortality sources (Reid et al. in PLoS ONE 8 (4): e58230, 2013, Lavers et al. in Global Ecol Conserv 17: e00579, 2019 \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:WZBGuue-350C", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3406693933634651287", "cites_id": ["3406693933634651287"], "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-021-86702-4.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:l4TFTBUCRy8J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
