We applaud the authors for tackling this important topic. As presented, however, we have reservations about the research which call into question the main conclusions. First, based on the data and results that are presented, there appear to be errors and some of the conclusions are not supported. Second, there may be a bias in the analyses that favors the conclusions. Third, details are lacking regarding the analyses, challenging their verification. We briefly describe some of the issues. At least, two main conclusions are not supported by the data and analyses presented. The authors claim that mislabeling results in the consumption of fish with less endangered conservation status, and thus \u201cmislabeling may not mislead people into eating less sustainable seafood.\u201d First, the authors fail to mention that many substitute species come from aquaculture, where IUCN status is less relevant and environmental impacts are commonplace (eg, Salmo salar and Pangasius spp.). In fact, it is perplexing that S. salar (Atlantic salmon) is included as a mislabeled species in the conservation status analysis, since it is commonly a substitute and rarely a mislabeled species (Cline 2012; Warner et al. 2015). Second, there are apparent errors. From our analysis of the data sources (Table S1 in Stawitz et al. 2016), 11 studies included salmon, and only two samples labeled as Atlantic salmon were mislabeled, substituted by Oncorhynchus mykiss in both cases (Filonzi et al. 2010). The former is listed as least concern and the latter has not been \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=5436569194333392903", "cites_id": ["5436569194333392903"], "pub_url": "https://repositorio.uc.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11534/30074/Research%20on%20Seafood%20Fraud%20Deserves%20Better.pdf?sequence=1", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:B9ASyeCScksJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2017": 2, "2018": 1, "2019": 1}}
