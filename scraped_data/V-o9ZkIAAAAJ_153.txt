The reserves are located off the northeast coast of Queensland, at approximately 150 o longitude, 16.5 o latitude and 152 o longitude, 17 o latitude, respectively. Both reserves come under IUCN (World Conservation Union) category Ia\u2013strict nature reserve. They are managed to maintain ecological processes and systems and to protect the habitats and biodiversity of the reserves from the pressures associated with human use. A major reason for proclaiming the reserves was to protect the seabirds, which breed in the region. The Reserve\u2019s Herald Cays contain a significant proportion of the region\u2019s breeding populations of red-footed booby, great frigatebird, least frigatebird and red-tailed tropicbird.Since 1992 the Department of Environment and Water Resources has been running a seabird monitoring program in the Coral Sea Reserves (Coringa-Herald and Lihou Reefs). The purpose of the program is to identify and track changes in seabird populations within the Reserves. The results of the annual monitoring program show that, with the exception of frigatebirds, the breeding populations of all species examined have remained stable since monitoring commenced in 1992. In contrast, the frigatebird population was stable from 1992 until 1997, and then crashed dramatically between 1998\u20142001. The decline in frigatebirds is suspected to be linked to oceanographic influences. 1997 was an El Nino year and it was at this time that the decline in frigatebirds occurred.
