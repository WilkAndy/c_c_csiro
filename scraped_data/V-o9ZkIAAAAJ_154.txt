We investigated the standing stocks of 12 types of AD on inhabited islands, uninhabited islands and mainland locations, and the potential factors relating to AD deposition. We undertook beach-transects and sea-surface trawl surveys; comparing 13 uninhabited offshore islands, four inhabited/touristed coastal islands and 81 mainland beaches in Queensland, Australia. The abundance and type of AD differed between sites. Geographic factors had stronger relationships with AD density on islands than mainland beaches. Hard plastic density was linked with forcing from wind and sea surface currents. Beach width and onshore/side-shore forcing were the most important factors affecting AD loads (predominantly hard \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:ClCfbGk0d_YC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4883196798358125464", "cites_id": ["4883196798358125464"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X2100953X", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:mPt1pp2ZxEMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 2}}
