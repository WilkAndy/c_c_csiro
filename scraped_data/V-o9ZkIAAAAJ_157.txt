While detection-avoidance strategies (e.g., secret compartments to hide illegal catch) are commonly used in the nature conservation context, they remain largely unstudied. \u2022 We address this knowledge gap in three sections. First, we introduce and hypothesise the likelihood of noncompliers adopting detection-avoidance strategies in the broader conservation context. Second, we identify and categorise detection-avoidance strategies used by small-scale fishers. Third, we provide recommendations for countering detection-avoidance strategies (i.e., countermeasures). \u2022 Because countermeasures are context-specific, they should be informed through systematic processes such as the intelligence cycle. If used properly, enforcement activities and countermeasures can help build voluntary compliance, particularly through procedural justice, or acting in a way that users perceive as fair and just."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=16625048373770194426", "cites_id": ["16625048373770194426"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.619349/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Marine_Science&id=619349", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:-g1CpGkJuOYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2021": 1, "2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
