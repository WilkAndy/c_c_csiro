Understanding the severity of this harm requires knowledge of plastic abundance and distributions. Dozens of expeditions measuring microplastics have been carried out since the 1970s, but they have primarily focused on the North Pacific and North Atlantic accumulation zones, with much sparser coverage elsewhere. Here, we use the largest dataset of microplastic measurements assembled to date to assess the confidence we can have in global estimates of microplastic abundance and mass. We use a rigorous statistical framework to standardise a global dataset of plastic marine debris measured using surface-trawling plankton nets and couple this with three different ocean circulation models to spatially interpolate the observations. Our estimates show that the accumulated number of microplastic particles in 2014 ranges from 15 to 51 trillion \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3766813748318210030", "cites_id": ["3766813748318210030"], "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..18.2541V/abstract", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:7oeQiyVpRjQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2019": 1, "2020": 1, "2021": 1}}
