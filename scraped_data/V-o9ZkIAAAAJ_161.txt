Monitoring floating marine debris is a growing key challenge to the global observing system and to Earth System Science. Motion of debris is affected by surface currents, winds, waves, and turbulence, the combined effect of which is not adequately measured directly or remotely, simulated with models or understood theoretically. Unlike many other tracers and pollutions, whose concentrations may gradually decrease with time as they mix with large volumes of sea water, floating debris can accumulate in relatively small \u201cgarbage patches\u201d or wash ashore at particular \u201chot spots\u201d. Fastgrowing production of plastic materials, not complemented by efficient regulations and mechanisms preventing them from uncontrolled entrance into the environment, creates conditions for fast aggravation of the problem.In situ observing systems and the science of marine debris are in their infantry. No part of the lifecycle of marine debris (sources, motion, degradation, impacts, sinks) is known well enough to close its balance or make predictions. This is primarily because plastic waste makes its way into the ocean as a result of disasters, accidents, mishandling, or oversight\u2212 events that are hard to document in a quantitative way. Also marine debris varies hugely in sizes, shapes and chemical composition (Fig. 1), making difficult the development of universal observational methods."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=4414402363827984636", "cites_id": ["4414402363827984636"], "pub_url": "http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/15647/2289356/26-dfcf91ed549b7dd08df568f1a1488d3a_MaximenkoNikolai.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_Jict48bQz0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 0, "2018": 0, "2019": 0, "2020": 1}}
