This solution will have the greatest benefit to the environment if supporting interventions are targeted at types of plastic pollution that are the most damaging from an ecological and wider risk perspective. Interventions should target three aspects of the pollution: reducing barriers to collection, improving the revenue from the materials and wider informal recycler remuneration, and increasing the quality of the materials. Done well, these interventions will increase the collection rate, reduce pollution from plastics, and help millions of people escape poverty. They present a scalable international solution to a global challenge; and are likely the only viable solution to the widespread lack of solid waste services and infrastructure across low- and middle-income \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=9293989678572055977", "cites_id": ["9293989678572055977"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901122002866", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:qS1v-V7i-oAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 2}}
