While fish production from wild stocks has plateaued since the 1980 s, those estimates are primarily drawn from large-scale commercial fisheries, whose boats are routinely monitored using a suite of sophisticated equipment to ensure compliance. Smaller vessels, however, especially in developing countries, have not been so rigorously scrutinised due to their sheer number and the associated high surveillance cost. This study investigated the viability of using low-cost anti-theft devices to detect spatio-temporal patterns of fishing activity in the small- to medium-scale snapper fishery of Indonesia. SPOT Trace\u00ae GPS tracking units (SPOT, LLC) were deployed on a voluntary, participatory basis, on 130 deep water fishing boats ranging from 1.5 to 29 m in length. GPS data were subsequently analysed through a port identification and \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:rmuvC79q63oC", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=13184516631989380938", "cites_id": ["13184516631989380938"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783622000078", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Suf0sAXQ-LYJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 2}}
