There is a growing focus on this transboundary issue, and a corresponding increase in public and government awareness. Understanding the key factors associated with litter and mismanaged waste on land will help to predict where and how waste enters the environment, providing opportunities for low cost, effective interventions. There exist only a few large-scale datasets with which such analyses can be conducted. To fill this knowledge gap we analysed a national, designed survey dataset of litter in the environment from Keep Australia Beautiful (2007\u20132017). We found that debris decreased significantly, with a nearly 6% decrease over the decade. Using generalised additive model modelling of 17 653 surveys at 983 sites around Australia, we found that site type, land use, state, population, and socio-economic status had the strongest relationships (in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=3795769134611026334", "cites_id": ["3795769134611026334"], "pub_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac5690/meta", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ntHhxepHrTQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2022": 1, "2023": 1}}
