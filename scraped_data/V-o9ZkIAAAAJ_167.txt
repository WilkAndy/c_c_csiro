Limited by small samples, variable data quality, and a focus on LHP estimation, previous meta-analyses have failed to settle debate about the extent to which LHRs are relatively invariant across all taxa or characteristic of specific taxa. We collected de novo 1335 published studies and applying rigorous standardization and quality control procedures developed, and make available, a database of high-quality M/K and Lm/L\u221e estimates. We describe two parallel but independent meta-analyses: a cross-validation study of the predictability of M/K by taxonomic category and an evaluation of alternative relationships between the LHRs using Akaike information criteria. These analyses demonstrate that the LHRs are \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=15094385754380079243", "cites_id": ["15094385754380079243"], "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsad026/7076233", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
