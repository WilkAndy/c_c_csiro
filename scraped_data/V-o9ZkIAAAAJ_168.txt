However, there is little systematic work that directly examines and describes the (dis)similarities across such systems, and how socio\u2010political and economic contexts drive such variation at a global scale. In this paper, we use 68 indicators from a novel dataset to examine the fisheries governance systems in place to constrain overfishing in national waters across 142 countries. We found that countries cluster in just two distinct governance groups which display different traits to constrain overfishing. Where one group takes a tougher stance on aspects regarding access to its fisheries resources, the other is more focused on gathering fisheries information and publicizing the data. The 10 greatest differences between groups relate to the gathering of information and monitoring of their fisheries, the \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8906074360031189795", "cites_id": ["8906074360031189795"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12713", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:I5vfrHG7mHsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 1}}
