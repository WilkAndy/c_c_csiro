However, the magnitude and spatial patterns of megafauna by\u2010catch are still poorly understood, especially in regions with very limited monitoring and expanding fisheries. The Indian Ocean is a globally important region for megafauna biodiversity and for tuna fisheries, but has limited by\u2010catch data. Anecdotal and scattered information indicates high by\u2010catch could be a major threat. Here, we adapt a Productivity Susceptibility Analysis tool designed for data\u2010poor contexts to present the first spatially explicit estimates of by\u2010catch risk of sea turtles, elasmobranchs, and cetaceans in the three major tuna fishing gears (purse seines, longlines, and drift gill nets). Our assessment highlights a potential opportunity for multi\u2010taxa conservation benefits by concentrating management efforts in particular coastal regions.
