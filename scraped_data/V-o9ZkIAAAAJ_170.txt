The agreement is designed to close off the opportunities for non-compliance, such as vessels engaging in illegal practices to land their catch. However, with thousands of vessels at sea and relatively limited inspection capacity, enhanced communication and information sharing to identify priority high-risk vessels is fundamental to successful implementation. Moving from traditional qualitative to quantitative risk assessments is one key step in ensuring the effective and efficient implementation. Risk profiling is in its infancy in the field of IUU fishing. Here, we present a transparent and repeatable method for eliciting quantitative weightings for indicators of IUU fishing using the Analytical Hierarchy Process.
