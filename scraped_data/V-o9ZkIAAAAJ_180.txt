Increasingly, fishers are using anchored fish aggregating devices (aFADs) to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.Aims To identify locations and use patterns of FADs and characterise aFAD usage in Indonesia and beyond.Methods We identified general patterns of aFAD usage by tuna purse-seine, pole and line, hand-line and troll-line vessels operating in Indonesian waters through reviewing relevant literature and focal-group discussions.Key results aFADs usage can be characterised by gear type and fishing strategy; vessel behaviour; equipment and spare parts for aFADs installation; association with light; trip duration, catch per unit effort (CPUE), ratio of live bait to catch, fuel consumption; existence of aFAD floats on board vessels and by-catch \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:dBIO0h50nwkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.publish.csiro.au/MF/MF22055", "cites_per_year": {}}
