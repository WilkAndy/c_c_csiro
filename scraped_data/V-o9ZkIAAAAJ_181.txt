However, the fate of this plastic in the marine environment is poorly understood. The deep ocean has been hypothesized to be a reservoir of plastic pollution, and it is often thought of as a permanent resting place, or a sink. While the mechanisms for the transport of plastic to the deep ocean are still under investigation, there is no doubt that plastic objects are being deposited on the seabed and plastic particles are becoming mixed into deep ocean sediments. Globally, it has been proposed that 14 MMT of microplastic may reside within the top 9 cm of deep ocean sediment; however, no estimate of the total mass of larger plastic objects residing on the ocean floor exists. This study aimed to estimate the mass of plastic pollution on the ocean floor.
