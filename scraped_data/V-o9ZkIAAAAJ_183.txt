It is estimated that three-quarters of marine debris is plastic, with approximately 70 to 80% of floating plastic accumulating the coastal zones. Marine debris transport and concentrations are driven by water convergences (fronts) generated by oceanographic processes, such as wind stress curl, Ekman pumping and tidal mixing. The concentration of marine debris has been reported in gyres, eddies, tidal fronts, salinity fronts, and coastal fronts. This study explores the possibility of fronts as an indicator to detect marine floating litter along the continental shelf, an understudied area. We focused on the northeast coast of the USA in the North Atlantic.
