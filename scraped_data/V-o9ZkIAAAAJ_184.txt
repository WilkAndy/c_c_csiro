Albatross exemplify this paradigm, overlapping multiple threats at sea, including bycatch. The typical characterization of bycatch, the number of individuals, ignores the long-term, population-wide repercussions of bycatch. Including an estimate of the reproductive value (RV, the loss of future reproductive contributions, given bycatch) is a complementary tool, incorporating the population-wide repercussions of bycatch. While bycatch management via dynamic spatial management allows management boundaries to move, it requires monitoring and enforcement to be effective. We provide a proof of concept to optimize bycatch enforcement activities by dynamically targeting areas of concentrated future productivity characterized by RV. This paper examined a population of black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) as a case \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X21002955", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:tI0kC2kKGWoJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
