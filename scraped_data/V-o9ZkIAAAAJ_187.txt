Management frameworks typically address bycatch with eet-level controls on shing. Yet, individual operators differ in their shing practices and e ciency at catching sh. If operators have differing abilities to target species, they should also have differing abilities to anti-target bycatch species. We analyse variations in threatened species bycatch among individual operators from ve industrial sheries representing different geographic areas, gear types, and target species. The individual vessel is a signi cant predictor of bycatch for 15 of the 16 species-shery interactions, including species that represent high or low costs to shers, or have economic value as potentially targeted byproducts. Encouragingly, we found high performance operators in all ve shing sectors, including gears known for high bycatch mortality globally. These results show the potential to reduce negative environmental impacts of sheries with incentive-based interventions targeting speci c performance groups of individuals."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:HbR8gkJAVGIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-605785/latest.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lg799tpvAWIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
