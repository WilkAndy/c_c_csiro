Here we present a risk analysis for plastic ingestion by sea turtles on a global scale. We combined global marine plastic distributions based on ocean drifter data with sea turtle habitat maps to predict exposure levels to plastic pollution. Empirical data from necropsies of deceased animals were then utilised to assess the consequence of exposure to plastics. We modelled the risk (probability of debris ingestion) by incorporating exposure to debris and consequence of exposure, and included life history stage, species of sea turtle and date of stranding observation as possible additional explanatory factors. Life history stage is the best predictor of debris ingestion, but the best\u2010fit model also incorporates encounter rates within a limited distance from stranding location, marine debris predictions \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C", "num_citations": 185, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=7712475626141849804", "cites_id": ["7712475626141849804"], "pub_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.13078", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:zBgLM7g3CGsJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 3, "2016": 13, "2017": 17, "2018": 23, "2019": 31, "2020": 26, "2021": 27, "2022": 30, "2023": 14}}
