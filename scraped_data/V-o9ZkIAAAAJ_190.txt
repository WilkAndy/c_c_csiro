Until recent decades, most of what washed ashore in these remote communities was comprised of natural materials. However, there have been growing concerns about the increasing quantities of plastic waste, including lost fishing gear washing ashore in northern Australia.The Gulf of Carpentaria (GoC) survey area represents 3350 km, or approximately ten percent of the Australian coastline. The Gulf is home to numerous threatened and endangered species, however, many of which occur in the shallow waters there. The movement through the GoC of abandoned, lost and derelict fishing gear (ALDFG) or \u2018ghost nets\u2019 exacts a substantial toll on coastal and marine wildlife, ensnaring marine turtles, as well as dugong, crocodiles, sawfish, hammerhead sharks, sea snakes, and thousands of invertebrates."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:PVjk1bu6vJQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://parksaustralia.gov.au/files/ghost-nets/CSIROghostnetsreport_final.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:Sz6KrzMW_7wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
