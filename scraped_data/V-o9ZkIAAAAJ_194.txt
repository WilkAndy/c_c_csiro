Another way to look at it would be to ask: how much is too much plastic for turtles?This is a really important question. Just because there\u2019sa lot of plastic in the ocean, we can\u2019t necessarily presume that animals are dying from eating it. Even if a few animals do, that doesn\u2019t mean that every animal that eats plastic is going to die. If we can estimate how much plastic it takes to kill a turtle, we can start to answer the question of exactly how turtle populations are affected by eating plastic debris."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://research.usc.edu.au/view/pdfCoverPage?instCode=61USC_INST&filePid=13127113100002621&download=true", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:k7q8pflzODQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
