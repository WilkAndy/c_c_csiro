These crimes also lead to unsustainable harvesting practices, as they undermine both knowledge of the status of fisheries stocks and limits on their harvesting. One of the greatest contributors to fisheries crimes globally is transfer of fish catch among vessels, otherwise known as transshipment. While legal transshipment provides economic advantages to vessels by increasing their efficiency, illegal transshipment can allow them to avoid regulations, catch prohibited species, and fish with impunity in prohibited locations such as waters of foreign countries. Despite the presence of a number of monitoring technologies for tracking fishing vessels, transshipment is frequently done clandestinely. Here we present a statistical model for transshipment in a Southeast Asian tuna fishery. We utilize both spatial and temporal \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFMOS14A..03W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
