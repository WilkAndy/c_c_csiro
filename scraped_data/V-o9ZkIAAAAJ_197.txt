We use spatial statistical models and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to identify anomalous activity, specifically various indicators of loitering behaviours (for example, vessels travelling slower than expected, perhaps rendezvousing for transshipment), and gaps in AIS transmissions. Gaps occur for three basic reasons: saturation of the system in locations with high vessel density; poor quality transmissions due to equipment on the vessel or receiver; and intentional disabling of AIS transmitters. Resolving which of these mechanisms is generating gaps in transmissions from a given vessel is a critical task in using AIS to monitor vessels. Moreover, separating saturation and equipment issues from intentional disabling is \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFMOS11A1771F/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
