To combat this issue, there is an increase in policies that target specific types of plastic waste (such as microbeads and plastic shopping bags). Given that such anthropogenic waste have environmental impacts, reduce the tourism income of an area and result in human health issues, identifying effective abatement policies is imperative to reducing waste and litter before it enters the ocean. Within Australia, state and local governments employ a plethora of policies, campaigns and strategies to target abatement and reduce litter and waste inputs to the environment. Waste managers were interviewed from 40 local councils around Australia on waste abatement strategies and investments implemented in their council. Generalised linear models (GLMs) were used to compare outreach \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC", "num_citations": 180, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=695279189924840319", "cites_id": ["695279189924840319"], "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17305171", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:fwMxT70gpgkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2018": 13, "2019": 20, "2020": 30, "2021": 50, "2022": 48, "2023": 16}}
