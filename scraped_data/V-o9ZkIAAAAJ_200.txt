However, recent work estimating the amount lost from land on an annual basis suggests that the standing stock should be several orders of magnitude larger than the global estimates. We investigate the role of coastal deposition within the first few weeks after plastic enters the ocean and very near its sources, one of the hypothesized sinks for the missing plastic in this mass balance. We utilize a continental scale dataset of plastics collected along Australia's coast and in the offshore regions together with models of plastic release and transport based on Lagrangian tracking to investigate the role of local deposition in the coastal environment. Our models predict that the vast majority of positively buoyant plastic is deposited within a very short distance from its release point, with only a small fraction \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUOSHI41A..07W/abstract", "cites_per_year": {}}
