Marine ecosystems worldwide are affected by human-made refuse, much of which is plastic. The potential impacts of waste mismanagement are broad and deep. Marine debris comes from both land and sea-based sources and can travel immense distances. It can pose a navigation hazard, smother coral reefs, transport invasive species and negatively affect tourism. It also injures and kills wildlife, can transport chemical contaminants and may pose a threat to human health.Marine debris includes consumer items such as glass or plastic bottles, cans, bags, balloons, rubber, metal, fibreglass, cigarettes and other manufactured materials that end up in the ocean and along the coast. It also includes fishing gear such as line, ropes, hooks, buoys and other materials lost on or near land, or intentionally or unintentionally discarded at sea."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=999678705122644116&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:lJBbXHyS3w0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
