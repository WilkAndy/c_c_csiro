However, their characteristics, accumulation zones, and transport pathways remain poorly assessed. We characterised and estimated the concentration of marine plastics in waters around Australia using surface net tows, and inferred their potential pathways using particle-tracking models and real drifter trajectories. The 839 marine plastics recorded were predominantly small fragments (microplastics, median length = 2.8 mm, mean length = 4.9 mm) resulting from the breakdown of larger objects made of polyethylene and polypropylene (e.g. packaging and fishing items). Mean sea surface plastic concentration was 4256.4 pieces km-2, and after incorporating the effect of vertical wind mixing, this value increased to 8966.3 pieces km-2. These plastics appear to be associated with a wide range of ocean currents that connect the sampled \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13593612917298739529&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
