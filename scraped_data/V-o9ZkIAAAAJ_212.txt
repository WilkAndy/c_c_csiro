Invasive animals are a leading threat to island species, and their eradication is a powerful conservation tool. Because funding is insufficient to remove invaders from all islands, there is a pressing need to determine where in the world future eradications should take place in order to maximize conservation gains. Systematic conservation planning, incorporating both the potential biodiversity benefits and the costs of conservation actions, results in more efficient use of limited conservation funding. We applied a return-on-investment approach, integrating a wide range of geographic, biological, economic, and sociopolitical data, to prioritize island regions globally for invasive animal eradications. Geographic and biological parameters used in our model include the number of islands and total island area in all countries, distribution of WWF Ecoregions on islands, predicted species richness on islands for plants and birds, and IUCN-listed bird species threatened by invasive mammals. We extended traditional cost estimates to include NGO operating costs, hidden costs such as permitting to meet regulatory requirements, and potential costs arising from project failures due to corruption or political instability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://eco.confex.com/eco/2009/techprogram/P19471.HTM", "cites_per_year": {}}
