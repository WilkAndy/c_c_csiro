Other breeding populations exist in New Zealand, south-western Western Australia and St. Paul Island in the Indian Ocean. Tagging and banding studies indicate that breeding birds of the Lord Howe Island population inhabit waters mainly to the west of the Island during October to May. Birds then migrate north to waters surrounding Japan during the Austral winter.Seabirds are attracted to the baited hooks of longline vessels and can become snagged and drown as the line sinks into the water. Observations of flesh-footed shearwater (FFS) bycatch in Australian waters have been recorded on both Japanese and domestic longline fishing vessels. Increased observer coverage between 2002 and 2004 on Australian longline vessels, in order to monitor the effectiveness of an under-water setting chute and various line-weighting regimes, showed large bycatch rates of seabirds, and in particular flesh-footed shearwaters (Baker and Wise, 2005). In addition, substantial reductions in colony size have occurred on the island due to housing development. As a consequence of these sources of additional mortality, concerns have been expressed about the population's sustainability."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/43081063/Assessing_the_impacts_of_fishing_and_hab20160225-6720-1d8yq6m.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:09KBbpaexJUJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
