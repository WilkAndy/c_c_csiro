This review identifies that the final decision or ranking of options depends on the choice of performance scoring scales, even when the criteria weights are held constant. The report evaluates the \u201csensitivity\u201d of results to the choice to performance scales. It concludes that it is possible to change the final ranking of options just by recalibrating the scoring scales for the criteria."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/2220887/0607_0610.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:kyKn5ubk2DgJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
