These models are based on the understanding of species-habitat relationships. However, spatial autocorrelations (SA) in data may affect the accuracy of these models. In spite of being frequently observed characteristic of spatial variables, SA is still rarely considered. In this study, we analyzed the effect of 7 landscapes variables on the distribution of the agile frog (R. dalmatina) in northeastern Switzerland. Variables were extracted in 17 concentric discs of different radii, from 100 m to 3000 m, centered on agile frog breeding ponds. We described SA using Moran\u2019s I correlograms and we built autologistic models. An autologistic model is a logistic model that includes a measure of the spatial arrangement of the response variables as a covariate; usually called \u201cautocovariate\u201d. Comparing logistic (without autocovariate) and autologistic models (with autocovariate) we found key differences in the statistical estimates. Because regression residuals of autologistic models are independent, while residuals for logistic models are autocorrelated, we"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147919674.pdf#page=67", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZFLNQJ-m-msJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
