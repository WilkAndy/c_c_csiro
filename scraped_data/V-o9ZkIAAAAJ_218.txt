In the marine realm however, available information on species occurrences and abundances is often spread over multiple datasets of varying quality. It is common practise to translate such data into presence/ absence data, ignoring information contained in abundance and repeat visit data, and to focus on a single dataset, ignoring other available information. This underutilisation of the available data leads to unnecessary uncertainties in predicted species distributions, which reduces the accuracy of conservation planning procedures. We present a model that overcomes these flaws in the species distribution modelling process. We integrate two data sets, one on abundance and the second on presence/ absence of coral reef fishes. The Bayesian species distribution model we develop integrates these two data sets, while estimating \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197584", "cites_per_year": {}}
