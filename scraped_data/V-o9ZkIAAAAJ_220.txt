In chapter one I examine the spatial distribution of fishing activity relative to California's Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve. Using shore-based observations and landings data we found no aggregation of fishing effort near the reserve. I discuss the factors driving the spatial distribution of fishing, and their relevance to marine reserve success. In chapter two I use an artificial pond experiment and surveys of natural ephemeral pools to study the effect of habitat size and isolation on colonization patterns of predatory aquatic insects.
