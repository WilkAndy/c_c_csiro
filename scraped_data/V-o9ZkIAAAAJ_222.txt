Work utilizing these less studied nontrophic mechanisms may reach different conclusions than ones based solely on trophic interactions and abundances. One potential mechanism for nontrophic interactions is alteration in chemical cues used in foraging. Increases of the strength of foraging cues may alter the behavior of predators, increasing rates of predation on species in the area of the cue. If the species causing the increase in the cue is not the only prey for the predator then this situation could result in a range of indirect effects. The number of species involved in these effects will depend on the relative palatability of the species producing the cue, the number of alternate prey available, and the prey preferences of the predator. While use of chemical cues by predators and parasitoids in foraging is widely variable, it is argued to be much more common in specialist consumers (Vet and Dicke 1992). Therefore, this type of behaviorally mediated indirect effect should be confined to the relatively limited numbers of species upon which specialists prey.Formica lasioides, the most common ant species at Bodega Bay, California, may be an example of an omnivore utilizing a chemical cue, resulting in an indirect effect between a herbivore producing the cue and other prey species in the habitat. Preliminary observations suggested that F. lasioides foraging might be associated with foliage damaged by the larvae of the western tussock moth (Orgyia vetusta), a defoliating herbivore common on bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus) at the site (Harrison and Wilcox 1995). Despite the ant's response however, tussock moth larvae were not \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4122290082601709192&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
