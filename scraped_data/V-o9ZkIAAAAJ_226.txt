Changes in fishing gear and techniques have resulted in substantial reductions in bycatch in some industrial fleets. Ubiquitous small-scale fisheries can cause severe, population-level mortality of marine megafauna, but scarce resources generally limit mitigation of their bycatch. Large disparities in regulation, revenue, geography, and bycatch rates between industrial and small-scale fleets can offer powerful leverage for cost-effectively reducing bycatch through interfishery conservation resource transfers (ICRTs). High-revenue, low-bycatch industrial fleets that have exhausted avoidance and mitigation strategies could offset their residual bycatch by transferring capital to fund and audit measurable mitigation in high-bycatch, small-scale fleets. There is a range of regulatory, reputational, and economic incentives for both small-scale and industrial \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14632143179457207375&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:T5wzgrLQD8sJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
