However, the magnitude and spatial patterns of marine megafauna bycatch are still poorly understood, especially in regions where monitoring has been very limited and where fisheries are expanding. The Indian Ocean, for example, is a globally important region for tuna fisheries and has limited bycatch data. Anecdotal and scattered information indicates high bycatch could be a major issue. Here, we develop a risk assessment framework designed for"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8332584552357699188&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:dB4woIBJo3MJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
