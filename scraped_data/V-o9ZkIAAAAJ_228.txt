This industry often uses bonded labour, destructive fishing practices and deceptive practices to reap profits at the expense of local fisheries, coastal states and the marine environment. Although international resolutions and reports have been issued for decades, countries have failed to enact and enforce regulations to stop these practices due to a lack of political will, resources and capacity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://oceanpanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Illegal-Unreported-and-Unregulated-Fishing-and-Associated-Drivers.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:NfRkbfVnwK0J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
