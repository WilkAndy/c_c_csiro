However, a historical population decline was driven by by-catch of albatross from the illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) demersal longline fleet. The virtual removal of this fleet from the region allowed this population to rebound, yet these albatross are susceptible to by-catch in many fleets and future fishing behaviour is uncertain. Albatross demographics were projected assuming forecast changes in SST and five future fishing effort scenarios. These scenarios indicate a high sensitivity to shelf/slope versus pelagic effort. Specifically, scenarios altering trawl and legal demersal effort estimated slight changes in bycatch while a scenario allowing the re-emergence of the IUU demersal longline effort produced high by-catch estimates and a decline in the number of breeding pairs. Negligible by-catch occurred in pelagic fleets across scenarios. The sensitivity of this population relates to intense use of these habitats during the breeding period, where IUU effort was historically greatest, and diffuse overlap with pelagic effort in nonbreeding periods. These findings underscore the importance of continued surveillance and management of by-catch on the plateau region."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pam-Michael/publication/333893538_Future_resilience_scaled_by_surveillance_high_sensitivity_of_albatross_to_regional_illegal_unreported_and_unregulated_fishing_effort/links/60ec006b1c28af345861e159/Future-resilience-scaled-by-surveillance-high-sensitivity-of-albatross-to-regional-illegal-unreported-and-unregulated-fishing-effort.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:ZzgJytrgt5wJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
