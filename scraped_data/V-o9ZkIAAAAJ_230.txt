In the last few decades, researchers have 21 developed increasingly complex demographic models that identify the life stages thought to 22 be most responsive to conservation actions. When similar models were developed for sea 23 turtles in the late 1980s, extensive debate over whether resources should be spent on saving 24 adults, juveniles, or eggs lead researchers to ask: how do we design conservation strategies 25 for long-lived species when adults and large juveniles are more valuable demographically 26 than eggs with respect to population recovery? To date, researchers have focused primarily 27 on elasticity analyses that examine the effects of small changes in vital rates on \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13543761386134322122&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
