Changes in fishing gear and techniques have resulted in substantial 3 reductions in bycatch in some industrial fleets. Like industrial fisheries, ubiquitous small-scale 4 fisheries can have severe impacts on of marine megafauna, but scarce resources generally limit 5 mitigation of their bycatch. Large disparities in regulation, revenue, geography, and bycatch rates 6 between industrial and small-scale fleets can offer powerful leverage for cost-effectively reducing 7 bycatch through interfishery conservation resource transfers (ICRT), which are an extension a 8 tradable property rights management regime to non-target species. High-revenue, low-bycatch 9 industrial fleets that have exhausted avoidance and mitigation strategies could offset their residual 10 bycatch by transferring \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4146909146671743121&hl=en&oi=scholarr", "cites_per_year": {}}
