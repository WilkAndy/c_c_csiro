With an ultimate aim of assessing population and regional scale differentiation for this species, we isolated Puffinus carneipes microsatellites from a genomic DNA library. Of more than 25 clones which were originally identified, eleven polymorphic loci were developed from sequences and were used to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was moderate across 84 sampled birds (mean= 6.82; range= 3\u201313 alleles per locus) and three geographically disparate populations sampled exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Britta-Hardesty/publication/257795762_Genetic_variability_and_population_diversity_as_revealed_by_microsatellites_for_Flesh-footed_shearwaters_Puffinus_carneipes_in_the_southern_hemisphere/links/00b4953910d9f2b74c000000/Genetic-variability-and-population-diversity-as-revealed-by-microsatellites-for-Flesh-footed-shearwaters-Puffinus-carneipes-in-the-southern-hemisphere.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:hT-c961yPywJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
