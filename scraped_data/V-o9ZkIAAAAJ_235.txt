A recent extension to metapopulation theory has been the development of metacommunity theory, which broadens the framework to incorporate the interacting dynamics of multiple species. Much of the work using a metacommunity framework has focused on determining the necessary conditions for species coexistence. Another fundamental but neglected question is the distribution of communities in a landscape and what factors drive occupancy patterns. We introduce a stochastic spatially implicit, discrete time, finite patch metacommunity model to examine expected distributions of multiple species given competition between species. We use the notion of quasi-stationarity to understand the probability distribution of different patch occupancy patterns prior to extinction. We find competition between species reduces the abundance of the lesser competitor. In addition, our novel application of quasi-stationary probability distributions elucidates the relative stability of the multiple species states and single species states. We contrast our model"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=c79e86abf93586cc6bcfe786312db084d1560a9d", "cites_per_year": {}}
