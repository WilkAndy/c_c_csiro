Similarly, avoidance techniques are showing substantial promise. In some cases, such as the Australian Fisheries Management Authority restrictions on longline fisheries, avoidance of high encounter areas or times has been mandated by fisheries management (Anonymous 2006). In other instances, communication networks among fishermen allow them to respond rapidly to avoid high encounter rates on the water (Gilman et al. 2006).
