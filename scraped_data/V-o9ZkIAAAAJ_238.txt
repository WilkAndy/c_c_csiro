In the past, mitigation programs have been used to conserve wetlands affected by development, and is proposed as a cost-effective approach to offsetting greenhouse gas emissions through reforestation programs. The concept may be equally applicable to environmental management in fisheries. Each year, substantial numbers of nontarget species are caught and killed as incidental bycatch from fishing. Of increasing concern is the impact this bycatch is having on seabird, turtle and marine mammal populations. Substantial areas of fisheries are being closed to protect these species at great cost to the fishing industry. However, other actions may be taken to offset the impact of fishing on these populations, such as reducing predation by invasive species. In this paper, we examine the potential role of compensatory mitigation as a fisheries management tool. An example is provided of the potential cost effectiveness of rodent control relative to area closures for the conservation of a seabird population adversely being affected by an Australian tuna fishery. We find that, in the example being examined, invasive rodent eradication is over 100 times more cost effective than area closures. The potential for a similar program to protect turtle populations is also considered, along with potential funding mechanisms and the incentives that they generate. Importantly, evidence suggests that there is substantial variation in bycatch rates among operators, thus incentives that motivate even the adoption of existing best practices could be expected to result in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=1dd00dc5fd9c1bce9d1c9a99d45fa85b912423da", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:6yUwmOKRDB4J:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}
