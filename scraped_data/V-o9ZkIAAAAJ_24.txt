This gear (i.e., ghost nets), whether accidently lost, abandoned, or deliberately discarded, threatens marine wildlife as it drifts with prevailing currents and continues to entangle marine organisms indiscriminately. Northern Australia has some of the highest densities of ghost nets in the world, with up to 3 tons washing ashore per kilometer of shoreline annually. This region supports globally significant populations of internationally threatened marine fauna, including 6 of the 7 extant marine turtles. We examined the threat ghost nets pose to marine turtles and assessed whether nets associated with particular fisheries are linked with turtle entanglement by analyzing the capture rates of turtles and potential source fisheries from nearly 9000 nets found on Australia's northern coast. Nets with relatively larger mesh and smaller twine sizes (e.g., pelagic \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC", "num_citations": 157, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=6650269409745195517", "cites_id": ["6650269409745195517"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12355", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:_VGCJMuASlwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2015": 9, "2016": 15, "2017": 21, "2018": 11, "2019": 13, "2020": 20, "2021": 20, "2022": 36, "2023": 8}}
