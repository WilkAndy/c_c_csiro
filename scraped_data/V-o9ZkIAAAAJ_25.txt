Quantifying the effect of regional hazards is particularly challenging for species such as sea turtles because they are migratory, difficult to study, long lived, and face multiple anthropogenic threats. Expert elicitation, a technique used to synthesize opinions of experts while assessing uncertainty around those views, has been in use for several decades in the social science and risk assessment sectors. We conducted an internet\u2010based survey to quantify expert opinion on the relative magnitude of anthropogenic hazards to sea turtle populations at the regional level. Fisheries bycatch and coastal development were most often ranked as the top hazards to sea turtle species in a geographic region. Nest predation and direct take followed as the second and third greatest threats, respectively. Survey results suggest most experts \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "V-o9ZkIAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC", "num_citations": 152, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=8587704324385365187", "cites_id": ["8587704324385365187"], "pub_url": "https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01541.x", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&oe=ASCII&q=related:w1wTW5WnLXcJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2011": 3, "2012": 9, "2013": 9, "2014": 9, "2015": 14, "2016": 12, "2017": 19, "2018": 14, "2019": 17, "2020": 11, "2021": 13, "2022": 16, "2023": 4}}
